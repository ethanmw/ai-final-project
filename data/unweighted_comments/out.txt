When life hands you a tiny swimming pool....
Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.
That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!
He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.
It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you.
What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?
Love this post üôÇ
Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off.
My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I‚Äôm there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot.
Now he won‚Äôt croak!
You are a very good human OP!!
I love you OP. ‚ô•Ô∏è You just gave that frog the best day of his little life.
Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"üòÅ
You rule
Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond?  Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.
The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.
*wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...
Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clip
This leapt into my heart!
I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy.
Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.
DID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY‚ÄôS THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little.
I love frogs. They‚Äôre so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep.
People like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ‚ù§ we all can learn from that!
Froggo does a soak
My name is FroggI am so hotHere comes a manWhat has he got?It is some waterSo nice and coolI will not drink myNew swimming pool!
He fit perfect in there!
He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him üòä
You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.
In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.
Good on you. But just for reference frogs don‚Äôt regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn‚Äôt effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel.
I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them
What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!
Tiniest wading pool.

This is one of the cutest ‚Äúgiving an animal water‚Äù videos so far. Ahhh so cute
I love frogs so small that their swimming pool is a bottle cap. So cute.
If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?
This is so wholesome.
You‚Äôre a damn saint.
Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE
It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.
 congrats on making it to the top posts of all time
So since we‚Äôre talking about caring for small animals here I thought I‚Äôd bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I‚Äôve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I‚Äôm getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over ‚ÄúNO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!‚Äù They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there‚Äôs no animal. It‚Äôs just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn‚Äôt amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. Welp that‚Äôs it
Kind of amazing
Stupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!
I love how he shuffled all the way to the front so it looked like he was resting his chin on the finger :‚Äô)
Doing God‚Äôs work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you
Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin.
That wiggleüòç
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
He *is* drinking while soaking! That‚Äôs how frogs do it! You‚Äôre a good hooman!
When you come from a long day at work and get in the pool
Omg I love this. Little green frogs are seriously the cutest
Gud freg
"Ahhhhhhhhh, nice." Frog probably.
He just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OP
I love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, ‚ÄúUgh, don‚Äôt fuck with me, it‚Äôs too hot.‚Äù Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren‚Äôt going to kill him.
Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!
/r/HumansBeingBros
That frog looked at the camera/human and was like ‚Äúare you serious? For me? Okay, don‚Äôt mind if I do!‚Äù
My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.Nope.This gets my upvote nonetheless.
Quick, sign a contract with him!Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot
You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh.
You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp
 Frogs don‚Äôt physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.
He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond.
You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all time
I sent this to four of my friends and their responses were so sweet, they're all 17-19 year old dudes.  "so cute. so fucking cute""THEY BABY""Big fucking moodHe's drinking tho, thas how they do that""happy!!!!!!!!!!"I love my friends
This post is going to be one of the top posts of reddit and i feel so happy because people can learn from it and do the same
Thats how they drink

Oh lord that is insanely cute. Well done you.
It rubs the water on its skin so that it rehydrates again

R/humansbeingbros
As soon as he realized it was water, his need for moisture overcame his fear of humans. Such a sweet thing to see. Thank you for being such a kind person and even noticing the plight of such a little creature.
Frogs don‚Äôt ‚Äúdrink‚Äù, they absorb water through their skin!
amphibians absorb water through their skin so this was the same thing as a drink to him.
This is so fucking cute I actually gasped and made a weird squealing noise... he‚Äôs so happy in his tiny little pool üò≠üò≠üò≠
Frogs can drink though their skin
You're a good person OP. Keep being a bro to all beings big and small
TIL Reddit loves frog.. super cute though
Fun fact: Frogs and toads don‚Äôt drink water they absorb it through their skin
That little wiggle after he got in the cap!
Cutest thing I've ever seen P. S.  You guys are nice to help a lil froggie
Wouldn't that be a... full body *croak*? Haha... I'll see myself out...
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry froggie, I‚Äôll keep you moist‚Äù
Aw little wet froge
We don't deserve frogs...
Imagine being stranded in the desert, and a gigantic hand stretches out of nowhere with a perfectly human-shaped ice cold full bathtub for you.
Its a frog sitting in a bottle cap cooling off! It‚Äôs so cute!!!
This is truly r/bettereveryloop
I like how he elegently submerges himself. I was expecting a good ole' belly smacker.
Froggies drink through their skin! So he DID take a drink!
240k upvotes?!? I've never seen anything like that holy fuck

Cutest little green I‚Äôve ever seen.
Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him. Way to go frog bro.
Is this the last day we can comment?
So cute
Hopefully that water wasn't chlorinated
Man, top post of all time!
Technically, he took you up on the offer. Amphibians absorb moisture the their skin instead of physically drinking water. His little scoot in the cap was him maximizing his surface area inside the water. Good job caring for the little guy!

This frog is so cute. The backyard looks heavenly too.
r/soakies
We've been getting a huge heat wave here too, +30's and above, which is crazy hot for where I live.  I never even thought of this but I should probably put large water bowls outside for various animals that may be desperate for water or a place to cool off.
Thank you for helping Frogger üôÇ This video is adorable.
I love how it starts off suspicious, then realizes that there's a nice little pool of water.
I don‚Äôt know why but all frogs have an Australian accent in my mind.
Any way this was in Texas? Because we were melting today.
I mean look at the size of the container you offered him! He obviously thought you were offering a bath.If someone pushed a bathtub full of water towards you would you think... oh, a drink?
If i fits, i sits

I want everyone to use the term "froggo" IT'S SO CUTE >_<
Thank you for doing this!! Making the world a better place, one frog at a time :)
frogs skin is permeable to water, his wiggle squat was moistening and drinking though his skin.you did a good deed OP.
For an amphibian, full body soak is a drink. Good on you, kind sir
I think this is my favourite thing ever on Reddit to date!
Awwww that‚Äôs adorable
Frogs can drink through their skin so technically it is having a drink
Green boy doin an absorb
So wholesome. I love the way it looks at you like, "what? Really? That's mine? Nice....ahhhhhhhh, refreshing."
Should make a little rock pool in your garden area without pets. If you have frogs its a good sign that you probably have alot of creepy crawlies around that probably need water too. Pot bases are great with a few rocks in them and some fresh water. We do it for all our wildlife in summer! big and small!And i dont like frogs at all! But in the heat im happy to help anything in need!!!
Holy crap, this is currently the second highest voted post on r/aww of all time!
Frogs ‚Äúdrink‚Äù through their skin btw. So technically he‚Äôs drinking and bathing :D
Many types of frogs drink through their skin and not their mouth as one would think. That is probably why he/she went into the water, to get a drink. Google it. Still extremely adorable. Great post.
Boopity Boop, Bappity Bap, There's a Tree frog in my Bottle Cap. üíì
The heat here has been really intense as well and the poor jackdaws and crows are all panting and look miserable. We saw some grouped around a small, shallow puddle in the road, taking quick sips, so we bought some water on our ice cream run and poured it into their puddle for them.
Wow this became the top post of all time in just 9 hours!
This is very adorable. I truly do love frogs, they‚Äôre just so cute. However, I absolutely would have screamed, dropped the cap, and retreated quickly at the moment he looks up. They‚Äôre so unpredictable and that‚Äôs the one thing that terrifies me about frogs. Face leaping little shits.
Don‚Äôt amphibians ‚Äúdrink‚Äù through their skin though? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Little dude very well may be getting a drink after all.
I wish I had the video still, but I ran into a similar situation in Queensland. This guy was just parked on the bench in like 34 degree heat, tilting his head towards the shower.https://imgur.com/xvJRySB
Interesting. A frog named Heat Index.
He was having a drink, frogs absorb water through their skin!
I mean what do you do when a giant offers your a pool of water?
That‚Äôs one of the most adorable things I‚Äôve ever seen. Love.
I officially declare this is the highest upvote post I've ever seen.
who would turn down a free bath?
This now the top post in this sub.Stay cool, froggo.
Don't frogs actually drink through their skin?
Frogs drink by absorbing water through their skin so it did accept your drink of water offer.
He's [drinking](http://allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/skin.html) :)

Why does OP only have 14k karma when this post hit 235k
frogs drink through their skin.
I think thats how they drink to be honest. The water gets absorbed into their skin and then they lick it off their face... i think.
And Congrats! It‚Äôs the top aww post of all time and it‚Äôs not even a day old!
Me when someone offers me just a little bit of attention
Love this.
i can't tell you how many times i see a pic or a gif here that i fall in love with and save, which is deleted by the time i want to show it to a friend.  please never delete this, and if you do, please send me the link to the OG. :)i love tree frogs so much (i have two RETFs) and i've been watching this off and on all day.  in fact, today was a pretty shitty day, and every time i needed a little lift, i looped this six or eight times.i cannot even deal with how adorable this is.
imagine getting one of the most upvoted posts in just a day. wow props to you OP.
Your cute science PSA: Frogs do not drink from their mouths like you do. Most absorb water and gasses directly through a thin layer of skin on their belly and pelvic region called the ‚Äòdrink patch.‚Äô (I know because I'm a frog scientist)
How does it feel to have a Top 8 of all time post after only a day?
You should that that frog don't drink water like we do ( using mouth) , they absorb water by their skin using  gland called "drinking patch"...So ,in a reality he only accepted your cold drink respectfully
I understand. My wife and I often go far out of our way to help frogs, toads, and turtles. Won't anyone else think of them?
This is the highest upvoted r/aww post! Congrats!
I cannot stop watching this over and over!!  SO CUTE!!!!
My heart..
You should post this on r/awww. So cute
The way it just settles into the water. Ugh
you deserve a special place in heaven sir
holy crap this is now top post on reddit.
Great. He‚Äôs gay now.
Wuss Poppin here for the comment
Frogs absorb moisture through their skin rather than drinking it(as do a lot of other amphibians), so it was always going to be both a soak and a drink.
I'm gonna guess that frogs and most other amphibians absorb a lot of water through their skin.
‚ÄúCould you take me to the nearest pond please?‚Äù
Make sure there's no chemicals in that waterCan't have him turning gay
He put his toes in the water, I guess you could say he toad the water...I'll leave now

I learned in science class, frogs can stand *any* temperature so long as you slowly increase it over time.
and then the frog pounded 5 bud lights while waiting for mrs frog to come home & playing FIFA
Got that shiver in his little frog balls.
Wow, what a nice & thoughtful gesture! Thanks!

Awesome!
Been in Tokyo for the past week. Heat index has reached 100-high teens plus us walking EVERYWHERE. I wish I could jump in a cold pool like this little guy and it be socially acceptable.
I‚Äôm not sure why but this made me cry :‚Äô)
We get very large toads, small orange salamanders, ringneck snakes, garter snakes, and once even a good sized spotted salamander about 8 inches long on my property.  I see them all as beneficial against insects, and they are protected creatures in my yard.  Any specialists in small reptiles and amphibians out there that can tell me what I can do in my yard to help them thrive?
I was going to destroy the planet with nuclear fire until this video was uploaded to my mind. Maybe humans are worth saving after all. Good Human, you are a hero to your people. Rejoice!

I like when he/she gets in and pauses then hunkers down for a good soak. He/she totally trusted you or, perhaps said: ‚ÄúF-it. If you‚Äôre going end me, do it while I‚Äôm soaking my frog-leather self in this cool pool.‚Äù

Frogs drink through the pores in their skin so...

Zen moment of the summer
FootloosePickleJuice, you're awesome.  I love it. Nice work.  You're cool (ing), too.
Growing up I would get lots of green tree frogs in the house.  I was always taught to thoroughly wash my hands, rinse all the soap off, and only pick up the frog (to take it outside) with clean, dripping wet hands
Bless you
ok i liv with u now
Would it surprise you if you knew that frogs ‚Äúdrink‚Äù through their skin?
He's so tiny that he fully submerged himself into a bottle cap full of water. It's crazy that the bugs he eats are almost the same size as him.

Funny story. Once when I was young a tree frog fell in the boat with me and my dad and he handed it to me. When I was done with it I threw it in the water and he was like ‚Äúwhat the hell why would you do that?‚Äù I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a frog‚Äù he said ‚Äúa TREE frog. Not a WATER frog‚Äù and I cried cause I thought I drowned a frog.
He‚Äôs probably drinking through the ‚Äúdrinking patch‚Äù located on the belly and and underside of their thighs. I learned this from Tuck Everlasting

There's something special about the combination of a kind human and an appreciative frog. Didn't know that until now. But definitely special.
So cute! You should put a small dish of water or something out there for him.
What a cutie
Damn, you‚Äôre a real homie!
He‚Äôs totally smiling at the end <3
I didn't know I needed a frog in my life.
Frogs actually drink by absorbing water through their skin so he did, in fact, take up your offer.
From a frog lover, thank you for this
Don't worry, Froggy. I'll keep you moist.
How did you not keep him??? Omg soo cute
Well this just brightened up my day!
Poor guy
This is so kind ‚ò∫Ô∏è well done, op
This is a lot more polite than the time I caught a lethargic amphibian in the basement, took it outside while half asleep myself, and put it a little too enthusiastically in the nearby small pond. Tried to help, ended up water boarding. :(
Thank you for taking care for that little frog.
"Mjeh"
That often *is* how many reptiles drink, especially desert reptiles. Water on their body will be drawn to the edges of their mouth via the capillary effect.Think of if you put a paper towel upright in a glass of water. The water will travel up the towel, wetting the portion not in the glass.This be how some frogs and lizards do.
Definitely gonna need more frogs on this sub
Thank u/footloosepicklejuice friend of frogs

That was very nice of you!!  anytime i see a frog or toad in the florida heat I always put them on the edge of the nearest puddle or supply of water because a lot of times they get too far away and bake.

A lot of people say humans as a species should die out, as we are killers and haters, but I disagree.  This video shows what we are; the love we have inside us for everything around us.  If there is even just one person with compassion and the want to help others we have hope and we should survive.
Just realised that this post is the top post of all time. Congratulations OP

It's cute how the frog checked you out first and decided you are there to help! OMG. My heart can't handle it!
Frogs drink through their skin
Literally making history here. Almost top post of all time on Reddit!
207k+ upvotes and 5 gold and is still not enough for how much this little guy deserves.... and the guy who gave him the water too
I just keep rewatching and hearing "Hmm?... Ooo... Ooohhhh mmmmmmm"
OSfrog
210k!? It's been a while since I've seen a post upvoted that high
Lol this is sooooooooooo *COOL* ü§£üëå
If I fits, I sits.

The wife hangs these flower baskets on the outside lights at our house every summer. One year, while watering it, I see movement inside, and it turns out a frog decided to make it his/her home. So i cut out the bottom of a cup and filled it with water and placed it nicely inside. The next day, I come out to check on em, and low and behold, he is passed out inside the cup in the water. He stayed around for a good 3 or 4 months before he/she decided to move on.
The way they just shuffled down in the cap a little deeper than when they first got in and just started relaxing was just adorable.
This is the most upvoted thing I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit, great job!!
I have watched this so many times and I love it
this reminds me of how my dog goes straight for the kiddie pool at the dog park and ignores all the other dogs when its hot out
This post and these comments are so wholesome ‚ò∫
Don't they drink through their skin?
Stuff like this makes the struggle to stay vegan worth it.
That's adorable! Made my morning even better! Thank you sir!
Oh my gosh!  Thank you for saving his tiny life!
Great job, frog bro.My house is covered with tree frogs in Savannah.
This is hands down the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Good Karma right there.
Wet boi is super happy
congrats on top of all time on this sub dude!
Good thing you got to him before he croaked.
Did ya at least kiss it?  That one may be a prince.
RIP his inbox
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
I'm French and I like it
Frogs can drink through their skin you saved that dude.
Frog: "Aah! What are you doing?? Wait, is that cold wa- oh, hell yes it is! Okay, don't eat me, I'm getting in. Oh, boy, that is, oh, that's heaven. Yeah. I'm just gonna... settle on in here... rest my little head on your thumb a bit, and.... Yes. All is right in this place."
The new champion of r/aww!!!
That little wiggle after he sat in the water...
Your username kills me....was that a saying you used when you were younger?
Isn't that still a cold drink for amphibians?
Frogs actually drink through their skin! So thats how the little guy goes for a drink üò¥
Amazing work there, chap.
I love this so much
how did that cute frog ended so high above the ground?
Congratulations sir you now have the highest upvoted post in this sub. *slow claps*
And just when you thought it couldn't get better,They actually drink with their butts.It's called a seat patch.
Hide a doggie bowl in the flowerbed and you‚Äôll have a friend for life. Just make sure to refill the bowl periodically.
Hey I know him
That's a pretty funny sight! :)First a little bit hesitant, but then it's like... fuck it, too warm to be picky.Got job on helping this little buddy out!
You're a good person, OP.

Congrats on the most upvoted awww post of all time

Aww ... so precious!  Thank you!
This made me happy
So beyond adorable.

Hey guys shouldn‚Äôt this be the 2nd most upvoted post of all time or am I missing something?
A frog never drinks from his own pool.
We have the same tree frogs around our house and this made me very happyüíö
He's never been more thankful for anything!! lmaooo

You're a very good person.

Heat index? Is that what they're calling "temperature" where you live?
Awh little frogger boye took a bath.. so cute :‚Äô)
For non-Americans that is about 43 Celsius
Tfw celcius. Very cute dog there though
You. I like you.
I hope there aren't any chemicals in this water that turn the freaking frogs gay
Everytime I hit play on something marked as video when I'm in office bathroom, I'm afraid something will shout from the video and make me feel embarassed...

Aw, I'm sure the little fella will be eternally grateful to you for saving his life ‚ò∫Ô∏è My friends and family always make fun of me because I save bugs from drowning in the pool or I put them outside if they're in the house, but they're denizens of the Earth too, little though they may be!
Frogs do not drink like we do; they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. Ps I‚Äôm not smart I googled it
I think you may have found a froggo doggo.
This has got to be like 100 times worse than when a cat sits on your lap and you're not allowed to move anymore
Heat Index? Is this an american thing?
Bud...

Thanks I needed this video in my life <3
I love this. He turns around like, ‚Äúthis? for me?‚Äù
He owns you now. And he knows it too.
‚ÄúThanks man!‚Äù
Omg first time ive seen a frog do that so calmly and knowingly. It KNEW you were offering to help it, looked straight up at you and took a chance. This is honestly amazing. And good on you for taking the time out of your day to offer aid to a small critter, clearly it appreciated it. Aaaa this is just so adorable and amazing and ahdjfjkf always makes me wonder what is going through some animals‚Äô heads, like especially for such a tiny frog which are normally skittish.Speaking of frogs, this just made me think of my own [frog story](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/90cn2u/full_story_in_comments_a_very_cold_tree_frog_i/?st=JJTG05I7&sh=e36dedee)
Your small kindness made a big difference to that little guy.

Good humans.
The little butt wiggle really made this even more adorable.
Adorable !!!!
What is "heat index"?EDIT:  "a quantity expressing the discomfort felt as a result of the combined effects of the temperature and humidity of the air."Google search.
Do you know what kind of tree frog he is? Hes really cute, you probably gave him such a comfy bath.
I love how he doubles down and almost goes ‚Äúahhhh yes yes this is perfect, thank you‚Äù
This is so pure.
So adorable! Both of you!
‚ÄúI live here now. Get off my property.‚Äù
I love the his further nuzzle into the water!
That's cool as shit
If I remember my highschool Biology correctly, frogs die when their skin loses moisture.
Texas?
My mum always left a bowl of water out for frogs.
‚Äúok human, now put me in some shade.‚Äù
Aww yiss
Love it!We had to get one of those animal bridges for frogs and ducks to get out of our in ground pool. We had a baby duck go for a cool off with mom and get stuck. Once we got him out we figured it was a good idea. It has also turned into the entrance/exit/sunspot for various lizards.
He seems too cute to not be poisonous.
When I was a kid my grandma put my pet frogs in the sun because they looked cold :(
Sitting like a prince on his throne.
Awwwwww. I get a shit ton of those frogs coming out of my unused pool each year. They‚Äôre sooo cute

Now you may kiss the frog!
that makes more sense.  hes/shes not a dog.  his/her skin has special protective properties so maintaining a hydrated skin is a survival tactic.
This silly behavior is why I love frogs and toads. They're so chill, and I really feel like they understand humans better than most other creatures- at least when it comes to our intentions with acts of kindness like this.I've never met a scared or nervous frog/toad.
This made my night. I love seeing my fellow humans helping a more vulnerable species.

That little frog prince purified himself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
If I fits, I sits.
That was quite an act of trust.  Also, you must have good water where you live.
My niece has discovered a few little tiny skinks living around a rock wall in her backyard.  She's upset that it is so hot outside so I promised her I'd help her make them a little minipond this weekend so they can "Netflix and chill" (her words...yes we are positive that she has no idea what this means and is just repeating things she's heard on TV.  Yes we lol about this).  So what do?  I was thinking of using this old white dogfood dish the previous tennants left in the garage.  Throw a few rocks in there, fill with water and tuck it into a shady corner of the wall.  Will that be beneficial?  Will they even care?
That‚Äôs how they drink. They drink through their skin.
This wins the Internet.
He looks so happy!!

Very cute! When we were kids my bro n a cousin n myself, we used to go to a creek that ran thru our small town. We would catch little frogs n some other creature n take them to our little clubhouse in our backyard. The guys would dissect them n I guess threw them away. (I was 8 then n didn't understand why they did that) I was excited to be able to hang out with the guys!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't frogs absorb water through their skin. So technically hes "drinking ", right?
It's not easy being green
Yes, because frogs drink through their skin. Good thing he knows that sort of thing. Cute little guy, and so nice of you to cool him off! More people should be nice to animals. :)
Jumpo doggo water sit

This is the single greatest frog-related thing I have ever seen.
Did you try kissing it?
Is the heat index an accurate measure frogs? Wouldn't humid heat be less of a problem for them? I'm not trying to be clever, just genuinely curious.
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week. Ty!

What a friendly frog
Such a bro

He fits perfectly!
Frogs are amazing and I love them.
Does any1 know the species? Because he is beautiful.
This is too cute .
Smol
Don‚Äôt judge him for drinking up the butt.
Gave him a little swimming pool lol
Amphibians, in particular frogs, absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The drinking patch is located under their belly and thighs, which explain the ‚Äúfull body soak‚Äù in the gif.
You from OK?
I love these friggin creatures
It is wetnessday my dudes!
That‚Äôs how they drink: they absorb it through their skin.
Doing things like this is under appreciated.
It is hot out there, my dudes.
This summer, I've been seeing an unusual number of dried up, tiny dead frogs on the concrete paths that circuit the park I take my dog to for his walks. So seeing this is timely.   (\^\^)ÔΩÇ

Why don‚Äôt you carry the frog to the nearest body of fresh water and put him in? How does a frog get so far from water anyway?
he‚Äôs so skinny
Nice save
Ribbeting stuff
This baby can take temperatures up to 10,000 degrees!
I found an injured, and probably dying crow on my front steps on July 4th. I knew there was nothing I could do to help the poor fella, so I let him be on the front steps (the alternative would have probably been to forcefully get him off the stairs). I also gave him a bowl of water. That crow might not have been able to get off the step, but he sure enjoyed crawling into the water. The next morning he was gone. In my mind's narrative, he got better and flew away. In reality, he probably died during the night and got carried away by a raccoon or cat or something.
You in texas?
So cute
Plot twist: actually a full size frog.
Kiss the frog!
Don't they drink through their skin?
I want a pet frog now üê∏
very hot here. this video is so cold \~
110 degrees? Water in his veins must have been boiling
That‚Äôs how frogs drink, they soak it through their bodies
I can't believe there are frogs that tiny!  It's good of you to offer some water.
Most interesting proposal ever.
OP your fingernail game is on point üñêüëå
Frogs need to keep their skin hydrated so they can breathe, you know.

Any frog above ground at 110f here is a crisp in 5 minutes. The concrete is searing hot to touch. Is it really 110 there? Birds sit in the shade with wings half open and mouths agape. Most people stay inside.
Do you have a permit for that?

Good people in the world
Those things are so cool, I used to own a couple of them. I remember when I was young me and a friend looked everyday for the entire summer because we knew you could just go out and find them instead of buying them from the pet store and we found like one silver treefrog late august. was totally worth just buying them for 7 dollars lol

Idea for a home made DlY trap. Catch one of these guys young. Give them a tray with water and a hollow and lure bugs/Flys in with some leftover meat/food. That frog gonna get big!

This is because frogs drink thru their skin, not with their tongues...tongues are for catching bugs.

110 degrees?! That‚Äôs above boiling D:
How are you not burning alive at the moment? Wood sets on fire at 100 degrees. Oh wait you are using the ancient temparature system that makes no sense
Well no shit that's how frogs take in water
Saw a small lizard on my porch mat yesterday. He scurried away to under my boot I left outside to dry. Lifted the boot and saw it was crushed underneath. I would have liked to give it some water like the frog.
110 DEGREES ???? How is the water not boiling ?
What the fuck is head index?
the water was later brought to a boil
In Soviet Russia, frog bathe you.
I actually said "awww."

That's amazing. Small animals like that seem to disappear when I get near. Somehow they seem to end up between my molars and through the gullet.
when did people get so pretentious theyre calling the temperature the "heat index"?
Temperature, it's called the fucking temperature

Judge Judy is a pretty cool dude.
I'm over here nearly crying over a Judge Judy clip. Damn.
And the wise judge spoke 'Cut the dog in half'
It's a good thing my dog is registered to me and I have proof that he's been mine since he was 8 weeks old.Because *he* really does do this with everybody.
Open and shut case, justice served!

If there's any question why Judge Judy makes so much money - she's the shit
I will John Wick any fucker who tries to steal my dog
You can tell it's the *smell* that gets the recognition.
It's always incredibly sweet to see a big man loving his tiny prissy pup.
"He does that to everybody." Oh shut up.

Someone tried to steal my puppy at the airport when I was 3 right before Christmas. The airport said he had arrived but he was missing and now they couldn't find him. He was only a few months old and a dalmatian in peak 101 dalmatian times so my dad suspected something was up. He wanted them to look harder, so he told ME, the exhausted 3 year old missing her dog, that someone had lost my puppy...right in front of customer service to intentionally make a scene.Anyway, he mysteriously turned up not long after I started screaming. He was found in a room he shouldn't have been in, back in a maze of offices. My parents swear someone was trying to take him for a Christmas present, but it ended with a happy reunion and 12 more years of walks <3
This is too pure for reddit
http://imgur.com/acSdMDs Owner immediately recognizes dog in court room
Yeah, when you start crying from holding a dog, it's your fuckin dog.
I remember an old man tried to steal our dog, despite him being collared. Luckily we were able to convince the man to give him back without getting the authorities involved.People who steal dogs are sick.
Congrats, you just made a 6'8" tall man cry happy tears.
Case solved, love that judge.
I love how sick of this shit Judy is."It's his dog. That's all, take the dog home"
Judge Judy is a G... My girlfriend bartends a few daytime shifts a week and always has Judy playing in the background. She's a mega fan. She even dressed up as her for Halloween. I wrote the production company and sent her a pic of my girlfriend in costume and she sent me back an autographed headshot written specifically to my gf. Gf cried. Judge Judy got me some serious cred. JUDY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.
"Court room"..."Judge Judy"Not what I was expecting.
Realistically the only fair way to settle such a dispute is by cutting the dog in half and letting them both have a piece.
Here, it was obvious to everyone the dog was his, but Judge Judy really does have an awesome BS detector. I both fear and love that woman.

Woman in court as dense as a logHer behavior likened to a hogShe tries to be coyand hide a good boyCause she purchased a stolen dog
Air bud irl.
I want to be clear that she didn't say "Would you pick him up." She said, "You can pick him up." She knows how much this dog loves him and how much he loves that dog. There was no hesitation of a doubt and I find that beautiful. And kudos for the guy for having restraint to not just lose it right there
Feels like this could also go well in /r/justiceporn.
"Court room"
"Listen to me carefully. Cut the dog in half.""Mmhmm. We both get part that way.""WHAT!? NO!! NOT FLUFFLES! Let her have him. As long as he's alive and happy.""It's his dog.""Oh he says that to everybody.""It's his dog."
I'm unreasonably angry after "he does that to everybody"And I'm like... biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I'm not crying, *you're* crying.
Background info:The lady had purchased the dog for $50 6 months ago with little suspicion as the "owner" wanted to get rid of it cause it was incompatible with their other dog.The actual owner found out about it 3 months later and request the return.The conflict comes from when the woman didn't believe (or didn't want to believe) that this was not her dog.TL:DR neither person was at fault and the real asshole was the one who stole the dog to sell for a quick buck causing both sides to feel emotional turmoil... supposedly.
I wish Judge Judy would run for president. I trust her.
"No your honor, you don't understand. This dog is a total slut! They'll accept pettings from anyone!"
And then you remember judge judy is fake af anyway
This is why you microchip your pets.

Judge Judy, for all the pageantry, is a badass. Good on her.
here's the episodehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0a6Oy7rfAand here's the commentary he said/she said at the endhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g&t=1m49s
Sad story:When I was 9, my dog was stolen from my garage, a small terrier.Six months later, he was at my doorstep waiting for me.I was overjoyed. He was filthy, washed him, cut his hair, combed him all night and when I woke up, the side door was broken down again into the garage.My dog was stolen again.
This made me cry! Good call, Judge Judy. <3
Amazing that the Judge Judy serious stare directly translates to: youfuckingassholebitchareyououtofyourgoddamnedmindbringingthisfuckingbullshitgarbageinmyfuckingcourtoflaw Language fascinates me
"it's his dog." case dismissed immediately! LOL
That was so satisfying to watch. Judge Judy is the bomb.
"He does that to everybody."Lol! Funny, he didn't do that to every other person in the court room.
Take my children, fine. Take my dog, I'll kill myself
What did we do to deserve dogs?
You can't say dogs do that to everyone. Kidding me? That was a reaction of a dog seeing someone he knew and loves.
"He does that to everyone." Not exactly
I think that's the brother or some other close relative of my parents' moving guy. I had just taken the bar exam that morning and he told me about him appearing on that show to recover a stolen dog. Neat to see the video!
Lol it's kind of funny that a big black dude has a tiny little dog lol.
This is my biggest fear. I adopted my dog two years ago from the Humane Society and I am terrified one day we're going to be walking down the street and he's going to lose his shit seeing someone.
BRING OUT THE DANCING LOBSTERS!
Her face always screams "I'm sick of this shit."

Case dismissed, bring in the dancing lobsters!
Bichons are the most loving breed. They get attached to a person very easily. He may have liked the lady, but it would have never been the same as his daddy.
My puppy greets me like this everyday, and only follows me.  Dogs know their true friends.
"That's him! He's the one who said I was best doggo!"
That woman felt the full force of the paw.
I just watched this episode this morning. Basically the Plaintiff (the guy who owns the dog) is suing the Defendant for stealing the dog, when the defendant claims she bought it for $50. So this happens.Wholesome case altogether
source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6gYeah that dog reacted that way after like 8 months away and you can hear the mom saying "don't. don't. don't." as she's putting the dog down.  They knew damn well that was his dog.   The mom tried to say she recently bought the dog, bs.
Yaaaaaas I love judge Judy. Also the moment when the dog and his owner make eye contact üò≠
I gotta say, despite the fact that reality shows are scripted, and hers probably just as much, I think Judy Scheindlin is one of the best celebrities out there.She actually practiced law, she doesn't take bull (how she acts in the show is how she acts in real life, though maybe toned down a bit) and the show is meant to get people to do the right thing. She's someone people can actually look up to
Christ, I didn't see the k on the votes. I was wondering why a post with only 119 upvotes was on the front page XD
I love it when dogs are that happy. It's like they can't handle what it does to their body
[Judge Judy Dog](https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g) Kind of interesting to watch with sound and see what happens afterwards . I love the, "Thank you Judge Judy! You're not so mean after all" lol
"Court room"
When I was younger, my cat went missing. I was pretty upset and searched/put out signs but didn't find her. A few years later, my vet called - a lady brought in a cat she found as a stray (a few towns over) and my vet recognized my cat. The lady told me all about the adventures they had while waiting to find her "mom" and was happy to return her to me. I offered to work to pay her back the vet bills she had but she said no, it was enough that she found the owners and got to return her. I always thought that was the sweetest thing a person could do for a young kid. I was so happy to have my cat back. :)
I had one of my dogs stolen out of our front yard. Apparently this 20 something dumbass and his girlfriend decided to pick him up and tried to give it to his dad as a present. Thankfully, his dad was sensible and called the number on his collar to return the him. Not the first time either. A few years ago, someone stole my puppy out of our front yard too. People suck.
I went on a week long backpacking trip and they only thing I could think about was getting back to my dog. I had not even a foot in the door when my sweet boy ran over and jumped in my arms freaking out and super happy to see me. I was crying so hard because I was happy to see him. I really relate to this guy crying at holding his dog again.
This almost made me cry, i haven't cried since my little han got murdered .
"He does that to everybody" what a pathetic excuse üòÇüòÇ
Every morning Trump wants a binder full of things people like about him.Every morning I'd like a binder full of gifs like this, where good shit's happening to folks all over the daggun place.
I own this breed of dog. There's no way that dude isn't the dogs owner. These dogs are sweet and friendly, but they only act like that with 'their' person. My own husband doesn't get that kind of love from my dog. Even if she hadn't seen him in a really long time. These dogs are perfectly nice and love people, they'll let anyone pet them. (Even my girl who is scared of everything.) But this amount of excitement is reserved for that one person that they've adopted.
"He does that to everybody"He's not doing it to you, is he?
This is beautiful.
Judge Judy is awful but was right here.
The guy had snausages in his pocket.
Bring in the dancin' lobstas!
You are the father!!!Whoops wrong show
Link to the episode or section or video or whatever
My grandma's pomeranian legit does that to everybody - especially strangers, though.
I'M NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING.
[**VIDEO SOURCE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g#t=1m0s)--
How do we know the dog wouldn't do the same thing to the other person if they hadn't seen them in a while though?
"it's his dog" with her "you're a dumbass" face
My dog walker would win my dogs in court. I wouldn't stand a chance.
this is it , i'm getting a dog.
That's not his owner, that's his bff. His best fucking friend.
Of course its Judge Judy. "He do that to everybody!" Yeah right lady!

"Judgement for the plaintiff. Good boy."
This is very very sweet. My parents shitzu does the same thing to me. Numerous times my stepmom has brought her in a room full of people and she runs up to me. I was probably her owner in a previous life.
If the dog throws a fit, the judge can quit
How do we know he doesn't just want the cookie in that guy's pocket?
"Ma'am put the dog down"*Immediately lethal injects doggo*Case dismissed.
Fuck, I miss my dog.
That made my heart sing.
People who steal pets suck
Judge Judy deserves every penny of 95$ million contract.
I FUCKING LOVE JUDGE JUDY. FOR REAL THO
Thank you. This just made my day.
That's some Solomon level judging shit.
Case dismissed bring in the dancing lobsters
That lying broad should be put in jail. "He does that to everybody" my ass.
Ugh why am i crying
Damn, I was just watching the video on youtube. A pet knows when they're with their owner- you can't fake that bond.
[Here's the clip from the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g)...with sound and post-interviews.
If someone tried to steal my dog they wouldn't have made it to Judge Judy.
I feel like you just inherently *know* thats his dog, even just watching without sound. Its a gut feeling
[Video with sound](https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g)
Aww more like laww

Pardon me...I've got something in my eye.
Open and shut case Johnson!
The feels yo
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Nothing so pure as this love.
I wonder what that case was about?
Judge Judy's one weak spot is dogs lol. But she also has a keen eye for dogs. Some may be fooled, but Judge Judy isn't. She's a smart cookie!
I love that the judge bases who should get the pet based on how the pet is happy to see the owner, this is totally how it should always happen.  Seen a few other instances of this before too (think it was also Judge Judy). I guess that would work ok for dogs, but not cats, because cats DGAF. lol.
Best thing I've seen all day
"He does that to everybody"The dog hadn't ran to the audience members, though...
If someone was selling a dog outside of a mall for $40 I'd find that sketchy as hell. She should have known better.
I had to leave my doggo with family when I moved abroad. But every time I come to visit he ignores everyone else and zeroes in on me. Doggo doesn't forget, doggo loves forever.
Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g sidenote: I've been watching judge judy cllips for like 45 minutes since seeing this what have you done to me.
I think this is my favorite gif ever
Some months ago I saw what she earns per year. I figured it would be like $5 or 10 million a year, but she gets [$47 million a season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Sheindlin). Not only that, she is the highest paid tv personality.
"He does that to everybody"-_She says, as the Dog runs to one specific person in the room filled with hundreds of people_
Take the dwaag
You mean stolen dog
Thats all take the dog home #owned
119k updoods
GODDAMN
Who the hell would lie about owning a dog to someone that was willing to spend thousands of dollars to go to court and get it back?
LOYALTY üíì
My mom eats this shit up. This one and the slightly younger, less mean female judge show. I don't get it. She's smarter than this.
Watched that on judge Judy YouTube yesterday . You can hear the defendant when jj says put the dog down telling her don‚Äôt
This is a straight up Pixar movie.
"He does that to everyone."Give me a break.Anyone that owns a dog knows the difference between a Good Boy greeting their owner, and a Good Boy playing with/asking for scratches from a random person, even if it's the most social Good Boy in the world. The tail wag is completely different. The whine is sadder (like they haven't seen you in a century, even though you just went to the cornerstore to get a carton of milk). They're way more jittery (like they snorted a line of coke). etc.That dude definitely owns that dog. 100%.
Cotdam! I just woke up, you can't make me cry like that already
I fucking love Judge Judy üòÇ
One of the greatest things I have ever seen on the internet.
"He does that to everybody"

What a piece of shit that women is. That guy cares more about his dog than most 5 year olds.
someone who steals someone's dog should be someone who no longer exists on this planet. Just pure evil.
Case dismissed. Bring in the dancin lobstas
Isn't this shit fake?
Yes, some dogs act excited around strangers.No dog, ever in the history of dogs has ever acted that way towards someone they didn't intimately know. As-in: A member of their pack.Dogs olfactory systems are the largest and most complex databases in nature. They can remember a person's scent decades after having seen them last. It is how they are able to find their way back to original homesteads after not being there for years. (They often do this when they sense they are dying.)Those women are thieving liars, and I hope they get eaten by bears.
"He does that to everybody" yeah, my ass.
I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that my dog gets ridiculously overexcited when friends and relatives visit, but is pretty chill greeting me when she doesn't see me for a few days. I'm old news.
Totally cried.
Is Judge Judy even real? I thought everything except sports (and even sometimes sports) are scripted.This is like Air Bud irl or something.
In the YouTube video you can hear the lady saying "don't, don't, don't" when judge Judy asks to put the dog down. What a scumbag.
That lady thief is poison.   A real piece of sh*t to stand in a court of law and lie like it was breathing.  Either mentally ill or just poison.  Do they fine the looser or put them in prison ?
yeah that is not a court room
Is this fake? A setup for the show? Or it really happened?Edit: Seriously, I am not familiar with this kind of show, and curiously asked a question. Was that offensive or so dumb that deserves downvotes?
Just like the script writers wrote it!
"lost"
The two women need to be slapped repeatedly for being so ignorant.
That's great the dog was returned safe!
This is the first time I have completely agreed w Judge Judy 100% and would of done exactly the same thing. Watch the YouTube link above to get more of the picture.
Judge Judy rocks!!!
Oh judge Judy. This must be the best episode of that entire show.Her net worth is over $300 MILLION.
If you want a dog there are so many who need a loving home. People who steal dogs are assholes. I know my dog and I would claw through hell to get to each other if we were kept apart. And that poor man was crying! Judge Judy thank you.
love judge judy for her bitchiness,   it's great.    She is a dog lover,   obviously.   The only thing in her pantry in NYC is dog food,   hilarious.   I just hate how she doesn't understand how to judge certain cases,    which is odd since she has the experience.   I noticed this in abuse cases and a few others --  she simply has never experienced it and doesn't understand that people rarely report abuse for various reasons.  Well known to most.   I realize she needs evidence,   and in this case saw it plainly....I think....but she is irrational and uninformed at times.   Still love her!

Judge Judy's the fuckin bomb.
Not to bust anyones balls in this, because it seems to me the guy really loves the dog, so I'm happy he gets it. But my moms dog will go apeshit the first 2 minutes of seeing me whenever I visit. Anyone she remotely recognize she will absolutely freak out over seeing. So it may just be that inital 2 minute spaz-out. Not that the dog doesn't love the guy, but if the roles were reversed and the guy had been with the dog all day and it hadn't seen the woman for a while, it might be just as happy to see her too.
What kind of terrible person would keep a dog from its owner
I mean this is cute and all but some dogs will do that to everyone.  I work at an animal shelter and we hold the strays from our county.  When a person come to claim a dog we require proof (vet records, pictures) and some people will say "just let the dog see me and you'll know it's mine."  That may be true but it's certainly not hardcore enough proof to send the dog home with that person.  People try to claim/steal small cute dogs a lot.
This reminds me of a r/thathappened post come to life: "the dog jumped out of her arms and ran to me.....everybody clapped"
you could show this in any country with no words, no sounds and every person would know exactly whats going on here.
That was awesome! Lol. That lady has some nerve.
I did not think it was possible to love Judge Judy even more.
What kind of sicko would steal someone's dog? It's cruel to the person and the dog. Just get your own dog, they practically give them away at shelters.
rrfgg QQ Xmas dgv
Gotta love meat-scented cologne. Jk, I fucking love that he got his dog back.
Step 1: Sell dog to Woman for $50 outside a mall.Step 2: Take buyer to TV court.Step 3: Repeat.
If you could hear it all, when Judge Judy tells the lady to put the dog down the defendant keeps telling  her not to. She knew..
I love that judge so damn much. She's not only a model judge but a model woman.
One of the fastest court session I ever seen
[Real Life Air Bud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HmuM48Cb8)
IM THE BOSS APPLESAUCE !
Was the case for the dog or did the dog just happen to be there? I assume it's for the dog, hopefully the man has his dog now.
"court room"
This is what it feels like when I pick my son up from his mom's house for my weeks.
Fuck those two women.  I hope they're infertile.
Judge Judy is a savage
Well I'm crying now
That's a wise Solomon sort of ruling.
Judge Judy aint no fool, clearly shes owned a dog once or twice.  Justice is served with kibble this day.
Nature for the win
Who the fuck are those people trying to say that's not his dog!?
I love Judge Judy
crying
Man tear
I teared up
Fake or not, this is awwww-some.
 I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying.
Awesome!
I thought this show was bullshit.
I know judge Judy is "scripted" but I'm glad that dude got his dog back. People who steal dogs are some of the worst scum known to man.
Judge Judy should be on the Supreme Court.
"That's all, take the dog home." -Judge Judy with the mic drop
My roommate has a dog and while she's 100% his, she's like 90% mine too. If that makes sense. She'd be happy if my roommate left and couldn't take her and I became her owner. But she's 100% his if we're both in the same room. Until she figures out the perfect spot so we can both pet her.
Judge Judy is the one celebrity I underestimated their net worth by the most, she makes so much from sick kids staying home and moms
I literally just watched this on YouTube. Creepy.
So cute
I had a pet cougar that greeted everyone the same.
Those are terrible f'n people. I am glad that man and his dog are reunited. üêï‚ô•Ô∏è
Judy da BOSS
Are real cases presented in these shows? I've heard it's either fake, or people in show bring cases that they couldn't afford to go through real courts for.
Not gonna lie, this made me tear up üò¢ so beautiful ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This made me so happy I just can't even handle it
Judge judy is the shit. She doesnt fuck around with your bullshit
I'm sorry, "courtroom?"
I mean props for them for taking the legal course but if for some reason the court ruled in their favor I'd just steal my dog back.  No way in hell I'd take that lying down.
Plot twist - his pockets were full of treats.
Fuck those dog stealing birches Edit: Stupid autocorrect. BITCHES
JJ is a dog lover and she knew right away, she won't waste her time on BS
He wanted the cookie in his pocket.

Next time just call the Paw lice... I should end myself
I hate when I'm on the same side as judge Judy....
I feel really bad for that poor dog. Being stolen and sold. Good thing he is with his rightful owner now.
Love this! Fuck that lady
I'm glad judge Judy didn't "king Solomon" the dog.
I always liked judge Judy, even though she is a judge who makes money for berating people she tells it like it is. Also she doesn't tolerate people's bullshit and is extremely non biased...people may disagree but hell if I was her age I'd be like " that's a kind of woman I'd want to call me on my bullshit" and tells me when my shit stinks, literally and figuratively.
That's some Air Bud shit right there. RIP
This is easily my favorite thing on the internet. The joy that dog had of finding his long lost friend is infectious. And the short shot of the guy holding back tears.... C'mon!!
I have a question,  i dont watch television especially not American, are these types of shows authentic? Is that a real judge doing actual law cases? Or is it staged performance replicating real court cases?
I'm crying, people.
This is beautiful.
Omg this is so cute!
Didn't plan on crying again tonight... :')
Nice! I think I remember this one. Good to see an ending like this one.
Dog thieves are such horrible human beings wow
"court room" . . . tv set> retired Manhattan family court judge. The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claim disputes within a _simulated courtroom set_. All parties involved must sign contracts agreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin.While they do sign contracts for arbitration she isn't a judge anymore so her "rulings" aren't final say and anything she "rules" on is possible to be taken further in an actual court.
Real life Air Bud
There should be montages of the stupidest shit people say on Judge Judy.
I remember this case very clearly (defendant won't return dog she claimed she rescued because it's now part of her family, real owner sues to get dog back) and now I can re-watch / get good feels whenever I want. Thanks, OP.
God dammit, dogs are the best!!!
If someone stole my pet, we'd be in front of a criminal judge because I'd either beat the shit out of the them or kill them. Don't mess with my pets. That's like messing with someone's kids.
It's like Air Bud!
"Courtroom"
Its fake tv
Isn't this show staged? Or just dumb reenactments? I always assumed Judge Judy is a judge like Dr. Phil is a psychiatrist..I haven't owned cable in a decade. .
 I've watched this like 10 times already it's so good lol
Judge Judy is the law.
This dog looks so much like my dog that passed away last year...i miss her so much...what I wouldn't do to have her run at me like that again...
I'm not crying..... YOU'RE CRYING!!
Who's cutting onions this time of night?
Boy if anyone ever tries to steal my dog they won't make it to court.
Give him his bloody dog back you thief!
So precious, glad they got reunited.

3000th commentI'm happy that the dog is happy
What a cute little doggy! I love Judge Judy, she's wonderful!
Ah, thanks for being an animal lover judge Judy.
Wait, is this court TV stuff actually real? Haven't watched it in like 10 years
What episode is this?
Man this clip would be so much better if judge Judy didn't have a show and successful career
I'm not crying... my eyes are just leaking!
Awwwww
So cute
If someone tried to steal my dog I might be spending a few nights in jail because I would probably flip out on someone and pound their head in.
Good job! I'm so happy for that guy!
I'm digging the good moments we've been getting from Judge Judy content. But was it just me? I hated this lady when she was on TV. Is she still on TV? Anyways, she annoyed the hell out of me, just wondering if I was the only one.
I literally can't stop watching this. That dog is great. stopstealingdogs/10 Will crie again

"Take the dog home" queen Judy
Just watched this on YouTube and I just cried so hard.
This is awesome!
Sitting on the toilet, crying. Thanks Reddit. You always know just how to push my buttons.
Okay..  It made me cry
Awwwe that dude was so happy
I'm sold
This is my favorite Reddit video so far (this week). I get tears every time I watch.
I had that happen... Dog showed up at my apartment on the 4th of July. Walked right in and sat in the kitchen looking all sad.I got her on the porch and took her picture, put her on Craigslist.Guy emails me says "That's my dog!" So I go on the porch and call her by name, no response. OK, cool. I tell the guy "Look, you're welcome to come take a look, but don't get your hopes up because she's not answering to that name..."Dude doesn't have a car so he calls a buddy with this beat up old pickup truck.Now the whole time I'm sitting with her to make sure she doesn't run off and she's hanging her head like the world ended.Then she hears this guy's truck and goes RUNNING down the stairs jumping and barking.Yeah, man, that's your dog.
Why can't people just be honest? Do you really like a dog you barely know enough to lie to the owners face who you know LOVES that dog?  I can't imagine taking my new puppy and telling me that it now belongs to them and then have them lie about why puppy is sleeping on my foot? (it's weird but my puppy loves feet.)
Is there another time where judge Judy is any more fuckin awesome.
This belongs in r/landslidevictory if there is such a thing!
I watched this so much. I couldn't imagine someone trying to keep me away from my family member like that. Way to go J.J.
While watching Judge Judy was fun, it made me realize that no amount of education can benefit stupid people, and that they outnumber smart people 10,000 to 1.
Judge Judy is such a badass.
I had to punch a fucking wall to feel manly againÔªø
In all fairness, dogs will do this to "everybody they know well". When my parents come visit, my dog goes nuts to see my dad. She goes equally nuts when either of my brothers comes visit.I am 100% certain under the same circumstances if they hadn't seen either of them in 2 years, and I walked her into a courtroom in the same fashion, she would immediately gravitate to them wanting to see them and lick them.Does that mean shes not my dog?
What kind of vile sack of shit steals someones dog.

Man, that makes me wanna cry,
I imagine he was reading a newspaper, he put it down temporarily, his glasses slid down the slope of his nose a bit so he could look you straight in the eye without a piece of glass in the way. He delivered the line, pushed his glasses back up, and then leaned back and continued reading the paper.
The fuck's that dog doing in a court room anyway? Only in America.
This is like that old story where pre presidential Abe Lincoln was a judge and was meant to decide who was the owner of a horse that was supposedly stolen and he did it by standing both of the involved parties on either end of a field and the idea was the horse would go to its owner so the horse ran to the guy and Abe Lincoln was like "it's his dog". Please tell me I'm not the only one that's heard that story ._.
Also that's not a courtroom.
My cats are like this.They go absolutely ape when then they see my wife and I and they couldn't give a fuck about anyone else.They escort me to my car every morning and meet me most nights on the street when I get home.*edit* words are hard.
Where are my testicles Summer?
This made me cry
The moment of recognition. Be still, my poor doggie heart!
And what weird sob story is this about the woman's mom being over sixty and having her first pet? She is young, she can pick up a good, loving dog from the shelter!
Not only is he the owner, he's probably a very good owner. Makes the dog so happy just to see him!
How sweet loves him toPieces
We never leave our dogs outside unattended. They are always on leashes or contained in the backyard. We have them microchipped as well just to be safe.
Never cried at a gif before. I am weak and pathetic
...And now I'm crying over Judge Judy
If this was a cat, it'd ignore you on purpose
First time I've cried watching a judge Judy clip
NOT A COURT ROOM!!!!
L O Y A L     B O Y E
The dog will surely recognize his owner. First is the owner's smell and then the owners voice.
Cute but so clearly staged.
...in "court room."
Love how the case is immediately settled after that.
My friend found a jack russell/chiuauau dog roaming the streets 6months ago. We put it all over the internet, lost and found groups but no owner came forward.  I have the dog now and it is like my 4th child. I feel bad for whoever lost their dog and it would be tough for me to give her up if anyone ever responded to the posts. Not sure what I would do. My kids love this dog too. Her name is Valentine brought her home on Valentine's day. http://imgur.com/2ZSzC1Y
dog teach you about loyalty and love
I don't know the context at all, and I think it's pretty clear the dog is his since he seems a lot more emotional about it than those girls. However my dogs both go ape shit like that every time they recognize someone as well. They more or less molest each of my friends when they visit.
Cut the dog in half!
The dog definitely belongs to the man!! Glad he got his baby back!!
This made me very happy üòä don't steal other people's dogs ya hoe
TIL if I ever lose my dog I have to bring my fianc√© to court with me because for some reason my dog hates me
What a charade.There's a lesson here - when something hits us in the feels - we forget to think.(not saying the dog isn't his - just that this is staged from beginning to end).
That's a man who loves his dog. Shit I'm at work and miss my dog now. üêï
Judge Judy fucking rocks
Wish the dog had bit that woman
This is the most upvoted post i have ever seen
Can I please up-vote this twice
I can't believe I'm crying this much over a 10 seconds gif
judge judy takes no bullshit. love how she never hands out pussy passes.
Dogs do not lie!
I feel like she's done with everybody's bullshit and just already knows who would win the case

You have to be a special breed of asshole to steal a dog or any other pet from someone.(Granted idk the exact context of the episode)
Aw, that man is so happy to get his doggy back. Big guys with little dogs make me feel warm and fuzzy.
This is why we need to chip our pets. So no one steals them from us.
And this was the day  The dog who knew 'sit' and 'stay'  Got to learn:  'Hearsay'
Incoming top reddit post of all time! The gif is a karma magnet of the gods.
That warmed my heart. My coworker is dealing with a rough (no pun intended) situation where he let a well reviewed and respected trainer take his dog and the trainer "lost" him. After finding some evidence including surveillance and multiple lies/stories not matching up he suspects the guy stole his dog, sold it or did something to it and is lying. Wish this was the outcome for my coworker instead.
So me and an ex girlfriend split up and she kept the Maltese I bought her. After about 2 months she couldn't take care of the dog as often so my mom and her would split custody. I couldn't since my new apartment doesn't allow dogs. I goto moms about once every other week and that dog loves my mother to death. Once I walk in the house though it forgets all about her and goes apeshit over me.Here's the kicker if my uncle visits (and he visits once a month) and I'm at moms the dog will go crazy for my uncle and forget about me. I'd bet if my uncle was in the courtroom and my ex who has spent way more time with the dog walked in the court the same situation would've happened.
If the dog sits, you must acquit
Stolen dog*
I truly can't think of anything I've seen on Reddit that I've loved more than this.
u/maxexodus look at this cute fucking shit
Hell yeah Judge Judy.
My doggo ran away about a year ago. She was missing for close to a week. One day we got a call from the vet saying someone brought her in and they scanned her microchip etc etc. Luckily she was fine, the people who had picked her up lived in a big house with a huge yard and two bulldogs, they said they really loved her and if we wanted to sell her they would love to buy her. Of course we declined that offer super fast and brought her back home ASAP.
That's a true dog owner, you can see the love in his eye
Is someone in here cutting onions?
As someone who had the ex take my dog, I find this deeply satisfying.
"I'm taking the dog, dumbass"
Judge Judy is a boss
If you take my dog the last thing you will worry about is your defence in court.
Judge Judy is for sure an animal lover, she's great, she has a schticky show, but she always comes down on the side of animals. There was an episode of Pitbulls and Parolees where they'd had this very aggressive dog on premises, and they couldn't tame her, she still growled at the workers, and then one day someone claiming to be her owner calls up. They drive the dog to her yard, the *sec*ond this dog gets a whiff of her owner, she becomes a pile of mush and affection. Tia could pet her, she rolled over, she was completely different. Her owner used to be in a bad area where the dog had to be protective, she kept that mindset until she saw her owner again. Really incredible.
Can those women be put in front of a  firing squad for trying to steal this man's poor dog?
Best. Judge. Ever.
‚ÄûHe does that to everybody‚Äú she says while in a room with 50 other people.
shoutout judge judy for handling that like a G
It's hard to stay sad after looking through the top posts of all time here.‚ò∫Ô∏è
I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying
Neighbour‚Äôs dog does that to my dad... Um...
People actually believe this shit is real ? Lmao so sad how stupid gullible people are.
[removed]
That looks so staged.
Its Judge Judy yo! Not a real court
Come on down to real fake judge shows!
You have to be a real piece of trash to steal someone's dog.
I'm on my period and my boyfriend of 8 months and I just broke up and i cried so hard. I should get a dog...
People who steal pets are the scum of the earth.
Why would you want to keep a dog the isn't yoursHmmmmm üòíü§î Dogs are Loyal to their owners You hoe.
My ex-wife was just like this dog. Every time she saw another man she would jump in his lap and start humping him. Sure wish divorce court was that easy!
I see we're playing fast and loose with the term 'court room' today...
> recognizes his owner in court room* in a reality tv show
Both parties win in these Fake court shows.
Wow I'm impressed by a fake court room soap opera drama cuz it feeeeels sooooo reaaaal
Just to be wary guys, that show is pretty much usually always fake. My friend was an actor in an episode once, also on the Spanish one primer impacto, and also on maury if i remember correctly as well. They're all fake lol
[deleted]
I thought it was a real court at first.
Judge Judy for SCOTUS!
I feel like she'd make a decent president...
As someone who had to get the police involved to get my dog back, this legit brought tears to my eyes.
Bring in the dancing lobseters!
This post probably could have used a better title. I was under the impression as the gif started that someone was just bringing the dog in who was wandering around outside. Probably a better title "Stolen dog immediately recognizes his true owner in court room"
If the dog did that to everyone it would have ran to everyone.  It didn't.  It ran to one person.  I love this reunion.
This is a great reason to microchip your pets!  Scan the chip, identification number comes up, they check the I'd number with what's on file, and there you go all the information you should need.
next time she should take a cat. a cat couldn't care less lol
As amazing as this is, I'm a pedantic, so I must point out that Judge Judy's set is as much a courtroom as mayonnaise is a sexual lubricant.
That look of evil when he picked the dog up was starting.
Court room... Judge Judy. Oooookay.
Swift justice has been served once again by the formidable Judith Sheindlin. What a gal.
Isn't judge Judy the court themed Jerry Springer, aka this is staged? So easy to stage btw
I'd love to see a cat version of this, where it just doesn't give a shit
Can someone explain why people stating this is reality tv, and mosty staged, are getting down voted? Is that not the case? You can downvote me too, just please explain why.
Turns out he washed his face with Dog Food beforehand
So scripted
I don't understand how we as a society don't understand that shows such as this a scripted (nearly) to a T. Judge Judy, Bar Rehab, any "reality" TV show in existence really.
That's one happy dog!
What episode?
Omg this is making cry. I'm so glad he got his dog back.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL

My family has our second Bichon now (first sadly passes away a few years ago). Both of them greet us like this every single time we come home, just absolutely loving and loyal lap dogs.
The court of paawww.
Nasty lying broads. They fucking knew better.
The lady standing on the right says "He does that to everybody"?? He walked past 50 people & started to sniff & panic when his owner was near. Animals are very conscious & feel as we do
[Here's one after 8 years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRXRv3ZzAw)A bit slower, but well, a Rottweiler of 8-10 years is a really old fart.
Damn watched the video and the defendant was sold the dog for 40 bucks because some crackhead probably found his dog. Listen people if a sketchy person sells you a good looking dog for $40 call the police and also if people contact you saying you might have their lost dog please don't be like this lady.

Damn I love judge judy
If you're wondering why this woman had this man's dog, she bought it for 40 bucks from a guy on the street unknowing that it was a stolen dog.
Omg that is sooooo sweet
"who you callin 'boy'?"
How did he find they had the dog
**JUSTICE...**is served.
is this shit real?  lol
Cutest case ever !
At least it wasn't a bird right
Is there a YouTube video of the full thing?
What episode is this?
Can anyone speak to if this is staged? I always question shows like this.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Eyyy you tell'em Judge judy
I love you mrs judy.
That scene from Air Bud playing out IRL.
Why am I crying
Buuurnnnn.
Geez, every dog that lady walks in with runs right to him! He must have a lot of white poodles!  üòÑ
My dog is a highly desirable breed and coloring, and he's super shy and friendly, so I'm absolutely terrified of having him stolen. Like I will never ever leave him tied up outside a store. I also going to order this "FitBit for dogs" thing that includes GPS tracking, and is small enough that I can attach it to his collar and then slide a bandana over it to make it invisible, because the thought of him getting stolen scares the shit out of me.But at least I know if I ever had to prove he was my dog, I'd just have to walk into his line of sight. He approaches most people, even people he knows fairly well, pretty timidly with his tail between his legs. But when he sees me, at first it's like "is that really you?" followed by "HOLY SHIT IT IS YOU THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER." Like even if I leave the apartment for 15 minutes, that's his reaction when I come back.
Could not like be this more!
Cute: but it's Judge Judy. That shit's staged af.
One of the sweetest things I've ever seen on Reddit.
Why would someone do that ?
Love you Judge Judy!
I'm crying
Judge judy is amazing.
Shits herself.
So thats cool they get the dog back, but what about prosecuting the dog thieves?
"He does that to everybody" Except her
Wtf, did she steal his dog or something?
Doesn't Judge Judy make like $45 million a year or something for her show?  Do you ever wonder how the economic mathematics of that works out?
If I was in court and my brother walked in with his dog it would run and greet me the same way. When I come to visit it gets so excited it pees itself. If anyone else comes and visits it could care less. For some reason I am his dogs favorite person and it isn't close. If I'm over it will never leave my side. I might have to steal his dog
Great gif, or GREATEST GIF?
"court room"
and THIS is why Judge Judy earns $45 million per year and deserves every penny.
Damn; I missed this episode...
/r/MasterReturns/
Right in the feels
"Court room"
context? stolen dog?
F that lady.
I wonder if that dog peed on her leg and called it rain
That is not a court room, it is a stage in a television production studio.
JUDGE JUDY WITH THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGEMENT
My neighbor stole our cat. We went to mediation and she did not want to give him back. I'm not sure what to do
This clip is so good.
Season 19 Ep: 256
Awwww
That dog is like his child. So what you bought the dog off the street. It's NOT yours, they knew full well that he was the real owner. If she really loved the dog she would have given him back to his real dad.
Good work Judge Judy but they used to hang horse thiefs in the Old West. This ain't no different, thieves ought to have hanged.
Well that's what I call an open and shut case üòõ
I'm not crying. *You're* crying.
when i want to see the depths of stupidity that is humanity (or some of it), i watch Judge Judy.
Dad? DAD? Daaaaddy!!! Da-da da-daaaaaaay!!! -- the dog
I remember that case. Someone stole the dog from the man's yard and sold it to the defendant for 50 bucks.
Best thing I have ever seen on Reddit. Ever. Thank you.
Judge Judy don't play no shit.
My biggest fear is someone seeing my dog and stealing him because he is so cute and corgis are not easy to get. He is 11 now and I hope he is less desirable to strangers but you can't tell how old he is.
DONT FUCK WITH JUDGE JUDY!
Serious questionIs judge judy a real tv show? Like are these real cases or just for tv?
Literally bringing the evidence to court.
Did anybody else start crying?
Awwww
It's funny because it's a TV show that's produced with a script like the rest of them!

My dog loves humans. He's the type of dog that will jump and run to other humans. He's friends with everybody I mean everybody even drunk people vomiting in the street. I totally understand that lady. My dog does that to everyone as well.
Beautiful
This just goes to show how even the tiniest dogs have the biggest hearts, my pom used to react the same way after not seeing me for some days, this made me smile and crushed me at the same time. Always love your dogs with all your heart, because they love you with all their soul.
Man I would be in court for an entirely different reason if someone stole my dog...
Man who's cuttin all these damn onions
I love that she's still trying to justify it. What a piece of shit.
I have mad respect for Judge Judy. She could have easily been a flash in the pan celebrity from the 90s, ending up on an E! special about where she is now. And yet she has managed to stay relevant and more importantly, make some mad bank for like 20 years
Ohhhh I'm such a fucked up person for secretly thinking the dog is just a happy little Doug and would do this to anyone and that lady may have actually lost her dog lmao

My dog was stolen out of my yard when I was little. My story didn't have a happy ending, but seeing that some people do get reunited with their dogs really does warm my heart.
judge judy ftw!
Judge Judy is so awesome.
I'm really glad they got their puppy back
fucking easier job in the world
Lesson:Stupid bitches makes you mad.Smart women make you laugh, tear joyfully, your life better.

That brought a tear to my eye
Awwww
I always thought this show was staged?
Is chipping required in USA, or was this before chipping?
It's funny because my mother in law "stole" someone's dog that looked just like this right out of their back yard forever ago. It was being left alone for days on a short chain, fed whatever scraps and hair was so unkempt. His name is zero and he's totally still alive. She's had him for 12 years now.
Don't fuck with Judge Judy.
I was kind of hoping for a wisdom-of-Solomon-cut-the-dog-in-two scenario.
Pick the dog up faster!!
Whenever I see Judge Judy I see Al Pacino. If Pacino was a woman he'd look like Judge Judy.
I always thought her show was fake? This seems too real.
It's not a real courtroom
Hi,  I'm new here
Please link, I need to hear Judge Judy deliver this sweet justice in full, uncut glory.
Holy shit I hope this happens to me, my ex took my dog away last week :(
I feel like my dog might run to my mother in this situation. (No, we do not live together; I suspect she secretly gives him junk food.)
Belongs in r/Judge_Judy_for_SCOTUS
That's the best thing I've seen all day
Judge Judy for president.
this made me cry.
First time I've seen her not be an asshole. That was a fast case also lol.
Is this a movie or is this a real court?
Right in them feels
I have the same sort of dog and she does that to everyone
is judge judy an actual courtroom or is it fictitious?
Do you mean 'stolen' dog?
In all fairness as a girl whose owned a lady beagle herself since puppyhood, my dog is a whore for any standard white guy with a beard. She loves them.
"court room"
As soon as the dog got closer even before that man said anything you can see the dog smelling his scent and starting to wriggle out of her arms getting excited. So cute
I think everyone needed this today.
Obviously staged
I teared up a little
Though if you watch the source, when she says he does that to everybody he's actually jumping excitedly back to her. So it might be he was attached to both of them which is sad too.
Meanwhile I went to say hi to my cat after he was living with my brother for 3 months, he wouldn't even go near me :(
The lady said that the dog "does that to everyone".  Well, not quite.  The dog ran right past her to see the man.
There was a couple college girls who tried to adopt a puppy from the humane society but he was spoken for. So they fucking went into the kennels and stole it. It was on camera so they got caught right away.... but still
"Lost"
The iq q
This is some Air Bud shit
I read about this. The situation sucks for both. She bought a dog, grew attached to it, and did not want to part with it. But it was clearly that mans dog.Personally if I was the guy, I would have talked to the lady let her know she could come visit when ever she wanted, or take him at her place from time to time.Who ever stole the dog and created this situation for these to is most definitely scum.
"Court room"
People do this to their own own helpless children for selfish reasons. As sickening as it is , it's not a surprise people do it to animals.
Is there a legit reason someone would steal a dog?
In the clip, the lady who bought the dog off the street tells the girl not to put the dog down. Honestly, not a big fan of her
Unfortunately my dog would do this for anyone she has spent a lot of time around. She'll stick with me when she calms down, but initial contact with someone she recognizes is very exciting. If it was done this way, I would be screwed if I had a crazy ex who wanted to steal my dog.
Check his pockets, probably has treats in them shits
Guile's theme goes with this...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGw8DWctAts
Lmfao "ya take the dog, its yours."
This made me happy, thank you
Is that a Bichon Frise?
Judge Judy loves dog, its her secret weakness.
Am I the only one with hidden onions in the room??? Somethings irritating my eyes. Just. Can‚Äôt. Stop. Tearing up.
Before walking became an issue for our dog (lame leg, bad hip), she would behave the same way whenever my mom was around. She still gets excited to see her, despite also going blind, too.
So romantic
This reminds me of a time not so long ago in a land not so far away. I was watching cartoons one sleepless night at 3am, when all of a sudden I hear a massive ruckus taking place on my yonder porch. With heart rate beating a heavy tattoo in my ears I hesitantly a peered onto said mentioned porch. When's all of a sudden a small fur ball cute as a button did appear, my freshly knock over garbage hanging out its cute teeth. Two score months pass and I had made the little ruffian my own. A small little Pittbull, who stole my heart along with my garbage. She peed on my floor and ate my food, making herself right at home in my domicile. She a bore no tags, a no name. So I kept her as my own. Posting flyers for the little whippersnapper around.Three score more months pass by and the little tike was growing quickly, when as suddenly as she appeared I hear a knocking. A pale lady came bearing the flier, her eyes filled with misty tears when she a saw my little fur ball. Then the little skank herself run up to the teary eyed damsel, forever leaving me with thoughts of what could have been. Bitch.
This is nice and all, and I'm sure this has been pointed out, but what if the dog lived with that guy for a while and knows him very well, but just hasn't seen him in a long time? I'm just not entirely sure that behaviour suggests he *owns* the dog, but the dog will be happy with him anyway.
"court room"
They stole this from Air Bud
This actually made me tear up. So adorable.
It's like the scene from Air Bud
Man I needed that today.
Fucking Judge Judy giving me the feels - it's like a combination of /r/Frisson and /r/WTF.
So, it's a custody battle over a dog?Wow.  Sorta reminds me of the king who had two women in his court arguing over how the baby belonged to.  The king gets fed up with the bickering in front of him, and tells them that, if they can't agree on who gets sole ownership, he'd cut the baby in half and give them each a piece.One woman nearly screams at the idea, and begs the other woman to just take the baby.The king gives the baby to the woman offering to give it away instead of having the baby killed.
No No he does that to everyone.
This is my happiest and most deserved upvote.
Fuck yeah
Pieces of shit like that who steal a dog and then lie about it ought to be charged with having stolen property. They are the lowest form of life.
u/WaterGuy12 would love this
Literally almost cried.
Lol that's funny

This is definitely real and not at all scripted.  Judge Judy, and daytime TV as a whole, is known for its authenticity.
Good job he didn't loose his cat.
Just in case you thought this show was real...
Hold up judge Judy is real? Lol I thought it was scripted lmao

are these things staged or real cases?
Glad the owner is reunited with his dog, they seem really happy to see eachother.
"Lost" and "stolen" are not the same.  That doggo was clearly stolen.
Is there a video of this anywhere?
So you've been watching Judge Judy clips on YouTube, huh?
source videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g
Yeah Judge Judy you tell em.
Something about big black dudes loving and owning small dogs warms my heart. That lady needs to go check out the local shelter and find her own creature of unconditional love.
Got to love that ruling.
This is so adorable...
"Thats what happens when you buy it for 50 bucks infront of the mall"
Same thing happened to a girl I dated in highschool. Her neighbors watched their dog, liked it, and literally took it
What episode is this?
I would have thought the dog would have started chasing the Byrd
If that was a cat. It will say "fuck you" to its owner as he runs towards the food.
That lady to the left in the audience when she first walks in really hated her nose
Where's the dog in this gif??
Ok stupid question, are these real court cases, or is judge Judy strictly entertainment?
The dog even acted like a child who finds it mother.
Ruff justice.
Isn't this stuff staged though?
Dog custody trials always make me emotional.
Question of genuine interest. Is judge Judy a legal judge?
"Court"
The owner did not immediately pick up his dog when he was jumping excitedly around him. Which owner wouldn't? Makes me a little suspicious about him being the real owner or not.
Have we learned nothing from that one spongebob episode
/r/eyebleach
AMAZING!!!!
Whelp, there goes me not crying today.
Thanks!!
Is this a show or something ?
Is this a scripted show, a reality show, or an actual court case?
Dogs are awesome
Why tf would that dude lie about the dog being his? Lol
You're crying
too good
*tv studio
You can tell the second he smells him and he probably hasnt smelt him in so long and hes so damn happy.
I had a bad day today and this really made me smile
This is why I respect judge Judy
This is why you microchip your dog!
That was super satisfying to see.
This warmed my cold dead heart

I bet you money there is a treat in his pocket
We don't deserve Judge Judy

but, it was his dog. Sorry.
My dog does that to everyone. I hope I never have to go to court.
Can someone let me know what episode this was so I can watch it?
this is as real as every other reality tv show out there.
No video?
Those puppies always say the truth dude
Maybe he is just a dog whisperer who knew saying "hey baby boy" would net him a free dog...
I don't think anyone will ever understand how much I needed to see this today.
-Put the dog down!-Really your honor? Right here in the middle of the court?
Judge Judy and executioner
Dogs are just great.
Don't care how staged it is, that's how my pupper reacts to me coming home, that shit is REAL.
Judge Judy's nod of approval, I need a gif of that.
That instantly made my day lmao
I've watched this 20 times and smile or tear up each time.
Lmao mans best friend
The dog clearly knows who dad is!Good dog!
What exactly was this case about?
nothing better in the entire world than dogs :)
I would be in tears at first sight if I saw my dog in that fashion after that many months of being forced apart.
Gotta hand it to Judge Judy
I love this
I loved it when another lady came in with a very similar looking dog right after!
Judge Judy owning chumps like usual.

I was just looking at pics and videos of my dog cause I miss him so much. I won't see him till Thursday and haven't seen him since last Tuesday. I then click on this and started crying. Fuck I don't wanna go away without my boy again
Did they really need Judge Judy to point something so obvious out?
"Court room"
Lol that doggo is longgo
I wonder how the case even came about
My dog acts like this anytime someone enters my apartment. Everytime my brother in law visits by dog goes apeshit. Not sure how he'd act in a full court room though.
Why can't I view this?
Awww
This is amazing!
loving animal
It's not every day you get to see the birth of a new sub on the front page!
Love my dog, but her dumb butt would go up to everyone. Lol However, I am glad he got his dog back. :)
And now, for another quick mystery:Dog: "Where's my human?!"Guy: "Right here, buddy"Judge Judy: "Case closed."Wow, that one was *really* fast.
To be fair, when I go visit my parents, our dog freaks out and gets so excited to see me for like a few minutes, then retreats back to his real favorites--my mom or dad.
Can I upvote this twice please
Probably had a cookie in his pocket
That's the kind of boost I need before work :)
Isn't that staged? It looks staged.
I honestly don't know of anyone ever having their pet stolen...
GET FUKT LADY
*stolen dog
Lol "court room"
No wonder she is the highest paid Tv star.
Put the dog down? Wow Judie, harsh.
What was het punicement? Somebody who knows IT?
Simply Beautiful. I'm so glad that dogs will always be wonderful, loyal friends to us.
Awww they stuck to the script
I can't help but think of the 0.1% chance where it's actually there dog and they are acting strange that day
We do not deserve dogs! They are amazing

Wait I'm confused did the lady who had the dog like take the dog and she basically saying it's hers buts it not
i can hear this in her voice "its his dwog"
Wowie
my dad produced a dad comment when I showed him this. He said. Oh so the guys name is Everybody?
I'm not going to scroll and see if it's been posted but these shows are a scam.  The looser pays nothing.  The show pays all damages.  You might as well make up a story with your best friend then pretend to sue them then split the winnings.
Chances are both of these people are very much aware who the dog owner is. Even though there may have been a legal battle at some point, they were most likely payed to act as if there were still an actual dispute. Regardless of the outcomes on Judge Judy, both parties to a case emerge as winners. That's because the show pays for the arbitration award, along with the litigants' airfare and hotel expenses. For most litigants, that adds up to a free trip to Los Angeles.
My favorite part is Judge Judy seeing the dog going nuts for his owner and she's just like "yup. Dog is his"
Stalking your Reddit account and I wasn't prepared to see your asshole.
Oh my dog!
Has anybody mentioned Rick and Morty yet?
"In court room"Maybe should be"On TV set"
Source/Clip
Certain things you see just being a tear to your eye and this got me. A dogs love and loyalty to their owner is unbeatable
This would really piss me off if Judge Judy wasn't staged.
Will everyone stop peeling those onions?  I'm TRYING to watch the clip!
I wish I had Judge Judy when my ex wife stole my dog.

This is the happiest thing I've seen all day.
Lol, I watched that same gif for ten minutes strait.
This breaks my heart. We just found a puppy this past weekend that was nearly starved to death. We nursed it back to health only for the owners to recognize it this morning. We gave it back of course, but not before they accused us of stealing it and threatening to call the police. Absolute vile scum.
This reminds me of the time my dog went missing, spent an hour or so looking for her, found her with an old woman. For obvious reasons she was sceptical as to whether it was our dog or not. So I said "bring her 'round to mine, soon as she sees my step dad, you'll know she's our"Lo and behold, the second she saw him she acted exactly like this. It's nice to know she's back with her loving owner.
My dog wouldn't do that. She is a total attention whore and will go to anyone üòÇ
Context please...
i am real lover of it.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
the girl said "no." before putting him down, she knew shed screwed up
I often wonder how much of this is staged. Or is this show at least semi legit?
Reminds me of the film/book Annie.  So cute
I always preferred Night Court.....Judy was never remotely convincing in a stage managed tv studio.
@brocollimonster :3
Mind Blowing
I love Judge Judy. Such a legend.
OMG
my landlord's dog responds to me like this when he hasn't seen me for a while
If that was my dog he would be wanting down asap and running to everyone in the room, nevermind me
You could see the dog recognize his smell first.
Can someone tell me what's the name of this episode?
Is it a teddy.......
It's judge judy - i always wondered, is it fake?
Does everybody think, that this is real? Isn't it a scripted show?
No, he just wanted the cookie in your pocket!
Take the dog home, bring in the dancing lobsters!
HE TOOK MA DERG!
"court room"
D'AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I love this
Awwwwwww pupppyyyuüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòç
Why steal a dog? Aren't there better things to take?
Reality tv or real?
Judge judy a woman with the wisdom of Solomon.
if it was a cat, it would've chosen the one who offers more food loli love catsthey're sooo...cats
gif got stuck.. i put the dog down =(
Try it with a cat this time. I would love to see that haha.
I love Judge Judy for being so succinct. "Take the dog home."
I have a maltese at home. When she sees someone she recognises after a long time, she behaves exactly this way. She sometimes cries a bit and barks as well, in excitement.I'm not sure if this was an accurate way to justify the ownership of the dog.If it was a wrong verdict, I feel really bad for those ladies.
Why does this look so fake.
Well that was expected, possibly
ITT People who don't seem to understand this is a fake scripted TV show.
Animals don't lie!
Damn it! I couldn't watch the video.Just a black screen.
No time for that
I can't believe how low people can get.. Seriously? stealing someone's pet?
you do realize those are staged?
Same way my doggie got excited the 2 times he got lost. First in the pound than at the humane society. First time some one had "claimed" him.....
Is this like an actual court or is it a reality show? (Judge jody)
You are...the father!!!
Is someone cutting onions? I think I might have something in my eye
that's one good doge.
He knows his owner full stop
what sort of maniac would take someones dog away from them
r/judyjusticeporn
Great, I just got busted for watching Judge Judy at work... D'oh!
So love this!!
glad he has his dog back
court room..?? PLEASE...
Awww man this just made me go awww I totally love this website full of cute and funny content.
When the video looped, I thought oh shit another lady with another dog just like it?? This is getting heated!
I love the internet. This made my week.  Dogs are amazing creatures.
My cat would do this.  He's not completely soulless.
My dog just immediately runs to the first male she sees...
Common sense.  You gotta love Judy.
"Court room"
Laww court.
Lol. Id totally get my girlfriends dog in this scenario. It always goes apeshit when it sees me but couldnt give two shits about my gf
One of the few times that someone actually loses something on Judge Judy
Nice little moment. not often you see a case that sweet. The defendant got screwed when the 'baby boy' was brought into court. Still...aww indeed :)
I'm tearing up ..don't judge me! You don't know my life!
I don't own a dog, but when I do... you fuck with me you die
Justice served, much satisfaction.
Pet reunions always make me cry. I never cry, not even in funerals... but doggies reunited with their bestest friend gets me every time.
I don't know the back story on this, but I hope after what this man went through that he made sure to microchip his dog. It can really help to make sure a lost or stolen dog makes its way back home.
Okkm
My dog woundnt do that tho this isn't full proof
M
Peter Campbell : A thing like that!
This lost all credibility as soon as I realized it was Judge Judy.
The good ol' treats in the pocket.  Works everytime.
This is so wholesome. And moving. I'm crying. üò≠
The fact that he probably met the woman and had to bring this to court is what pisses me off. If you want a dog, and have the means to take care of one, get a dog, dont take someone elses.
damn so mesmerizing
You can tell who is right and wrong by the meanness on the face of the horrible dog stealer versus the nice guy who rightfully owned the dog.*Bangs gavel*
NO DOGS ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM. judy: bring me the  dog
Love judge Judy!!!
I was hanging out in the car with our Bostons while my husband dashed into the grocery store one day.   Some people came up to me and complimeneted the dogs and then just straight out said "so how much you want for them?", as if I would just sell two of the three reasons I care about existing in order to provide for.  Am certain they would have stolen them had I not been there.
Looks like the dog was "Wait? Is that?" And one he goes "Hey, boy!" He recognized his voice.
That's EXACTLY how my dog would act... except he would be barking at anyone who looked at me or got near me lol
Wow already one of the top posts of all time , of course there's judge Judy in it.
Does someone know what episode this is from? I'd like to watch the whole case.
Dogs make the best judges.

Not so much lost....as stolen
Isn't all this shit scripted?

That's not a courtroom.
Late to the party, but I just love it when dogs get to testify in court.
Top post of all time on this sub in thirteen hours. 10/10
In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.   Hold on, she's losing sight in her good eye too.  The miracle of glaucoma or cataracts.
Anybody know the name of this show?
When I was a kid, we adopted a dog from a shelter, my sister and I we're out front playing with him when he did something like this, it was very unusual for him so it was really weird.  The family he ran up to just looked at him shocked and said "DogsName?!?" It was his previous owners, they had 3 kids but the third had an allergy to dogs so they had to give him up.  It was heartbreaking hearing him wimper when they left.

Loyal Dog
This made me so happy. Dogs are so loyal.
This is beautiful! 10/10, such a good pup
Although this is a fake set and everything, still hits home every time I watch it.
What kind of a terrible person tries to keep another persons pet and fights them in court over it?
What's the plot? Somebody finds a lost dog, owners track em down but the finders won't give it back?
why the gif looked like its from a tv show?
What souless douchebag would ever steal another person's dog?
I just cried - way to start my morning
I am not crying....
Where I use to live, ppl steals dogs and sadly, it happened to me with both of my dogs.The first was stolen when we was out one day and learned from the neighbor wife a seven months later, her husband came over to our house and cut the rope from the pole and tried to take him but Lil guy bite him and fought back. Dude got pissed off and rip off my dog collar and called animal control and said there was a stray dog attacking him and they took my poor dog away and we went to see where gave him away to see where we can get him back but sadly, they put him down.The neighbor moved(it's why she told us) after her husband went to jail for shooting a clerk at a mini store.Second dog was stolen after we give it away to a friend. She told us that she let him out on her yard to pee and run around when kids from her block came running to her door, saying a guy came out of a yellow car and jumped over fence and grabbed him with a bag and took off. We have no idea what happened him but I heard rumors there was a dog fighting ring in the city and I feared that what happened to him. He's a toy dog but I bet the asshole didn't care
Any idea what episode this is?
And that's why I'm a dog person
Oh you know, same ol' same ol' sup widd yah?
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen üò≠üò≠üò≠
MAN tears.
Not always a fan of Judy, but she nailed this one!
That's one hyper pupper
Word to the wise. Never buy a random pet off of the street.
I would like to see the entire show. What could those women say?
Judge Judy gets paid $45 million dollars a year to yell at people who have absolutely nothing.
And dogs don't just use their sight to recognize someone, they use their sense smell too. That's a pretty positive ID.
Commenting for posterity.
Now I'm even more confused
Love this story!
Actually cried. Wtf man ‡≤†_‡≤†
Man, a dog never lies! But cats, that a whole different story! Boom!
The people who kept this dog and owner apart are scum. Humiliation on TV is not nearly what they deserved.
just like the ending of Air Bud
Fuck yeah Judy.
How can you steal a mans best friend?
What's the sub? R/mademecry?
IM JOSE CONSECO!
TV has devolved into pure trash.
The fuck
This show is fake
this needs to go on r/poodles
This is one of the reasons I LOVE Judge Judy!
I've always wondered, is Judge Judy scripted or fake or something?
Does anybody know if any of the stuff on that show was actually real?

God that made me feel good! Thanks for posting
Fuck kinda court case is this... "Whose dog is it anyway?"
This is judge Judy?
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate
Judge Judy is so annoying.
>> court roomI see what you did there.
Lol why is this gif 174mb
Awww. it was heart-wrenching :'(
Who steals a dog??
Wasn't this the plot of a Disney channel movie?
I actually seen this episode on TV
a comment.
Heh
I must have missed the part where he ran to everybody in the court room
That close in is the best part.
I want to smoke the upvote button 1000 times on this.
Judge Judy is Solomon
"He does that to everybody" he literally just ran right past you
That lady is a fucking bitch. ‚ÄúHe does that to everybody.‚Äù
my heart is GLOWING right now
Sauce ?
"I'm just gonna stand here now"
This reminds me a ton of the story of King Solomon trying to determine which woman was the real mother of the baby.
This made me tear up
Ho that's where the judge gif comes from
Just me thinking that he could have deliberately put some yummy dog treats in his pockets? I think I‚Äôve seen that done in movie(s), not sure if it would actually work :P
I had my dog stolen by construction workers that were doing work where they had to pass through our yard and use our driveway. He was constantly running away and eventually ran from them and back to us.
This is literally the ending to "Air Bud".
You Americans dont understand that this is all staged?
fukkin rekt
So this is what Reddit has become? Judge Judy on front page.
I really love the little nod and squint she made to the owner of the dog, the universal facial expression of "I got you." What an awesome clip
Well how fucking scientific Judge Judy
The guy may have had a bone in his pants
My mom stole her neighbor's cat and had it neuteredü§£
The dogs obviously racist.
 cameras & pets have 1 thing in common. They can't lie
[deleted]
Takes dog home and "he dose that to everyone". Keeps dog.
I want someone to look at me like this doggo looks at his owner
Love it. Doggo comes in and is understandablely confused, then sees his human and is like "hey, wtf you doing here? I thought you left" "Hey boy" "FUCK YOU REMEMBER ME?!?!!? What the fuck is going on? Do you know this person? She took me! SHE TOOK ME BRO!!!!! SHE TOOK ME!!!" "Put the dog down" "BRO ITS ME YOU REMEMBER ME DONT YOU FUCK ITS YOU!!! HOLY SHIT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU!!!! SHIT MAN IM SO HAPPY FUCK I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE" "Pick the dog up" "YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS" Luvey luvey luv luvs!! "He does that to everyone" **"WHY ARE YOU TALKING HOE??"**
The title is misleading, it should say "Dog recognizes owner in joke room".
"courthouse"
Bullet to the head if you steal any of my animals
You mean TV set.
"Court room"
To be fair, if I brought my dog in the room, he would've done the same thing, excited to meet new people
"He does that to everyone. "And that was how I got charged with assault after throat punching a 60 year old hag.
... did this dude really say courtroom? as if this was the real deal?shit.... in the world of fake news and ignorace, it wont surprice me if people actually believe these joke actors are serving justice....
This was such a great roller coaster of emotions.
"I have made a decision.  We will cut the dog down the middle, and give half to each of you."
I don't live in US so can someone explain to me the process to attend a court? I saw that the majority of the audience are women as if they know that the court is about pets so they can join the court that they are concerned with.
Damn fat ass bitches trying to steal thr mans dog fuck them i hope they die
My cousin stole a husky that was from my neighborhood... to her defense she was mal nourished skin and bones dirty and full of fleas... at first i was hesitant to let her take the dog but realized she isn't getting the proper care she would be better off with my cousin.. she is now healthy and clean and an inside dog getting a lot of love.
Dog dont lie
I just watched the actual video. Woman even had the nerve to come on national tv court with piercings all around her mouth, just not looking presentable at all. Even when Judge Judy was saying "Put the dog down!" You can hear the defendant saying "don't.. don't." SMFH she knew what the deal was
Is this staged? It feels staged...
Doggos are beacons of truth, justice, and belly rubs
It's sad.The woman being shamed found a dog and fell in love.   Stop being mean to her.  She legitimately wants to keep her dog and she knows it's his too.   This is so sad.
I bloody love Judge Judy! Amazing woman! No mucking about!
I love Judge Judy
Usually I despise Judge Judy, but this time I think she got it right. :)
Judge Judy is the BOMB,
Reality TV. I don't believe any of it.
C'mon Vick, poodles ain't even fightin dogs
The world needs more Judge Judy's sorting cases out, shutting liars down.
Do people think this is real?
Brought a tear to my eye. Thank God for dogs.
Well, the man could have spent time with the dog even if it's not his dog. So dismissing the case that fast seems wierd. But what do I know.
A cat wouldn't do this
Aren't these staged?
Bitches are petty. They don't care who gets hurt in the crossfire after thayve been hurt. All they care about is hurting who hurt them. Nobody has valid justification as to why they throw petty temper tantrums when something doesn't go their way
"In court room." TIL a show set doubles as a courtroom.TIL internet strangers think they know more than a lawyer about what constitutes a courtroom. Spoiler: you don't. No public agency runs Judge Judy. No public agency stewardship of the proceedings, no court. Plain and simple.
123k upvotes ? Hope you know, that's fake court for TV ? I mean, sure, the dog can't act his emotions, but it's not a real case..
BAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA REDDIT THINKS JUDGE JUDY IS REAL. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. YOU GUYS WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING. NO WONDER THE MEDIA ARE ABLE TO PLAY YOU FOOLS LIKE A FIDDLE. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
judge judy is fake as shit you are all retarded

I didn't realize stealing dogs happened so often. Los if even more faith in humanity :/
Umm... isn't this the way the boy won his dog back in Airbud even though it wasn't his originally his? I miss that movie
Annnnnnnd this is why I choose dogs over people 99.9% of the times when I'm asked to choose between dogs and people
Dogs are so much loyal with his owner
I didn't like judge Judy when she was on air but i appreciate her now! We need more women like her!
Ummmmmmm, i hate to ruin the party guys. But this show is staged....
I was hoping she'd go all King Solomon on that shit.
Is this a joke? What's wrong with humans?Why am I here?What's the meaning of life?
As a dog owner, my dog will do this to anyone that she knows if we're walking out on the street, regardless of the person's closeness to the dog.    So it's not necessarily an indication of the dog liking the other person more, they're just excited to SUDDENLY see the other person that they remember.    So that dog may just know the guy, so this isn't conclusive evidence that the guy is the true owner, although it's just very likely lol.
I mean, he probably hadn't seen the guy for a while. He was excited to see him. Doesn't mean the dog doesn't like the lady too. Seems like a typical snap/ populist decision made on the judges part
[removed]
Can she give the dog to the defendant just like that? I feel like coming to a decision requires more evidences than just that.Although, I don't really mind it!
Why is this so upvoted?!? This "TV-show" is oviously staged. Shame on you Reddit.
It's a scripted TV show?
'Court room'
whoever wrote this episode deserves a gold medal, brilliant
Not court, TV Studio.Plus dogs are funny, one of our dogs likes to run up to us when we get home. Another might not even bother to raise his head. Same dog isn't sure if he wants me to pet his head or get too close, but at the other hand he loves sleeping directly next to me.Dogs are weird:)
Unfortunately my pugs do love everybody and I would be screwed to point out otherwise.
These scumbags go he does that to everybody smh lol
I do believe it's his, cus 9 out of 10 dogs I've seen are racist.
Is this how law in America works?If so what don't you let children of divorced parents into the court so they can judge for themselves
So this should be said. All judge shows like this are staged, just like Jerry Springer and other such shows.
She would make a good fucking POTUS js - stern but fair
But you can rescue a dog for free... I don't understand at all. Stealing someone's dog should be punishable by death (after some kind of terribly uncomfortable anal torture).
That's really unfair. My dog was always way more excited to see my ex-girlfriend because she would let him jump all over her. Whereas I would not acknowledge him until he sat down.
You guys know this is fake..... right? Judge Judy isn't real cases
Bring in the dancing lobsters
They took the case of a stolen dog to COURT!!!I don't know what could surprise me anymore. FFS man.
Are we not talking about the piece of jerky he had in his pocket?
Fake
White dog black owners
I completely disagree with everything that this post stands for. The same exact thing would have happened with my girlfiends dogs and I. Two full grown Golden retrievers would have greeted me just the same...... but she still feeds them and cares for them every day
Who is so trashy to keep a lost dog? Oh yes, Americans.
well he did communicate with the dog saying hey boy, hey boy....I mean, I still think it's their dog, but there's still a possibility it's not, however small that is.
is it me or the majority of people lying and being cruel in these things are women?
Missed a great opportunity to offer cutting the dog in half. Edit: It's a reference to King Solomon.
I'd like to reproduce
Man on left is Trump supporter.  Fat dog stealing hag is commie scum.
Plot twist: The guy had the dog's favorite treats in his pockets!
He's not Judge Judy and executioner. ..
This gif is HEAVILY edited from the original episode. The dog return running to the opposite lady right after and the judge didn't pronounce her verdict that early.
I don't know if that's his dog or not,  but I do know this is a fake TV show.
This is fake.
animals fighting over animalswe've come a full circle
Can we get a video link?
My dogs would do this to anyone they knew but hadn't seen in a while. If you want to steal my dogs, meet them once then take me to court.
This whole court setting is fake right  I can smell fake american 'reality TV' a mile off
This isn't a courtroom, it's a TV studio
oh hey, now judge Judy is only 99.8% horrible. progress!

My aunt has a dog that is always more excited to see me than it is to see her. This honestly doesn't prove anything.
Wait... was the court case over the ownership of the dog? Fuck, *Judge Judy* is a stupid show.
There's a Trump joke in here somewhere - I just know it.
But was she refunded for buying a stolen dog? It's not like she knew.
 Really wouldn't call Judge Judy a court room lol
r/whyweretheyfilming
Americans actually believe this is real...
It's sad when the person whose dog it isn't ends up winning the dog. They often immediately have the dog put down just because they can and they know it will make the husband depressed.
Paid actors. All of them. Even the dog.
To be fair... he may have just been saying hi... maybe it was the first time they saw each other in a long time. The right thing to do would have been to let him greet his co owner and then see if dog would stay with him or go back to the female's side. Word.
At least she didn't do what a lot of women do and have it put down.
But the dog is white...
"Court room"
I don't understand why it hurts when you bite your tongue accidentally but it doesn't hurt when you do it on purpose I also don't understand why you are biting your tongue right now.
She gets a lot of hate for being a guard at a Nazi Deathcamp but that made me kind of like her.
This is awful. I hate judge judy, I hate dogs, and I hate justice. Terrible quality as well. Just awful.
No offense to anyone whose gullible enough to take this gif at face value (could be his dog)... but as someone who gets along with most cats and dogs I just want to point out the loyalty of an animal can be won, even (or especially) without regard to how much total time is spent with the animal. Tldr You can build a close bond with a dog (as much or better then the owner) in a very short period of time
So fucking stupid and fake.
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen on reddit holy crap

This is me when I watch my own Snapchat stories over and over.
Reminds me of Nintendogs!

This is border-line adorable. Also always a great idea to study tape for next time
They say the dogs don't recognize themselves in the mirror (or on TV?) but having had a border collie that was smarter than some people I have met, I disagree.  My dog's been gone over 25 years and I still miss her every day.
Why name a girl Kirk?
This is awesome
"That's me! *bounce* *bounce* That's me!"
Border collies are so damn smart
Great job on the pups part!!! Maybe purina should put as much effort as this dog to try and improve their subpar product. Anything made by purina is pure dog shit...and that's BEFORE the digestion!!!
She‚Äôs amazing
That‚Äôs adorable, she looks so proud of herself! Very aww worthy
Border collies and aussies are damn near the same. That jumping is exactly what my dog does
I was pumped for her.
What an egotist
How do people train dogs to do this?
Gotta watch tape if you wanna improve.
whatever happened to u/GallowPlaceholder ?

You can see her getting all amped up. Ready to run through the fucking wall if the handler told her to.
I bet that dog doesn't eat Purina.
That was fucking adorable.
I watched this on YouTube! She's fantastic!
Good dogo
This is amazing
Man the slalom part is impressive.

Holy shit thats so cute
Now we need a video of the dog watching herself watching herself win.
Oh hell yes
Something makes me thinks she‚Äôs excited...
Yeah dude I know that feel that‚Äôs a good feel
‚ÄúGo me, GO!‚Äù
She‚Äôs a beast!!!
Border collies are the best

Shout out to 2011 where this was all I did in Nintendogs to get more dogs.That time when I deleted my save and lost my labrador and couldn't stop crying for a week...

#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/GallowBoob![Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
and it was not that many years back when animal science was saying dogs could see shapes and spaces on TV but they could never know what they were seeing. This here border collie knows he is watching kitty cat obsticle course on his HDTV! :)
Be your biggest fan
6 days -> top u/GallowBoob postSeems legit
Do you have a mirror?
Who names a dog Kirk.. much less a female.
This is wholesome as hell.
This is probably a stupid question but is it possible to breed out their short lives? Can we breed them to live longer than 10 years? They love us so much but they leave us so soon :(
God damn it not GallowBoob
Gallowboob back at it again
You‚Äôve really got the recipe for karma down, u/gallowboob.
Fun fact: just about none of the dogs who compete in this competition eat any Purina foods, because they're absolute trash foods made by a trash company.
If only my nintendogs could do this
TIL; This dog is infinitely smarter than most people I know. Can she become my manager?
And they say dogs can't see themselves! Seems this pupper knew exactly what was going on.
This is the most wholesome and wonderful thing ever!!!
Dem mirror neurons
I read the title as "Kirk, a former Border Collie..." and was like, but...then what is she now?!@
Border collies are amazing
Bordie collies are so smart it's amazing.  Their ability to learn is so incredible.  Very sensitive animals as well.   They need a lot of exercise and attention or they can really cause a lot of trouble.
This is adorable
*"Look at me! I was fabulous!"*
Haaah!! I looks as if she‚Äôs trying to participate! Man I love dogs
Any experts know if she knows it‚Äôs a recording of herself?
Omg that‚Äôs great!!!
#JESUS CHRIST ITS JASON BOURNE#
"OH MY GOD THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME! THATS ME! LOOK AT ME GO! I WON CUZ IM THE BEST! YAY ME! "
‚ÄúAnd then I jumped the thingy and then and THEN I went into the tunnel and I ran as fast I could and then I bombed it across the field..‚Äù
this is some r/eyebleach material right here
Me when I am playing a fighting game
So I've always wondered why some dogs watch TV and others dont. My dog growing up didnt give a shit about dogs on TV or even dog sounds on TV. But then this dog and others online respond directly to TV.
Awesome!
She's so excited!
This is awesome, please post the vid!
Flexing as always
The bouncing excitement!!!! What a precious floof.
Animals also have sportsmanshipüòÆ
"I'M DA BEST"
BCs are the only neurotic breed I will always love.
THE JUMPING UP AND DOWN!! GOOD DOG!!
She knows exactly what she‚Äôs watching. That‚Äôs awesome.
##i can talk big
mOM LOOK IM ON TV MOooOoMmm LOOK
I had no idea that the Purina Pro Challenge was a thing. Now I know what my wife and I are going to spend the next few hours watching. Thank you!
Nice.
‚ÄúGo, me! Yay! GO! GO, ME!!‚Äù
THIS IS SO PURE AND WHOLESOME
Border Collies are the best.
That‚Äôs a very smart dog.
That was 7 years ago. This dogs living in the past.
Don't insult human intelligence, *Kirk!*
That pupper is so excited.
The internet may have been for porn, but now it's for this! And porn.
My dog does the same thing while watching me play Fortnite.  Less bouncing with excitement, though... more just tilting his head as I transform without warning into a pile of weapons (mostly gray pistols).
What a happiness :D
fast as fuck
CONCEITED!
Awwwwwwewweeeeeee this is so sweet.
It's like NIIC The Singing Dog's track Instinct!
2017 Purina Good Boi challengeMy dog would chew on some poles and lay down for a nap.
Now THATS a good girl
Oh my heart
Dog: "THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME!..."
"That's me! That's me!!"
Is there any physiological difference between male and female Border Collies, or dogs in general? At least differences that would give them an upper paw in competitions of strength, agility, or intelligence?

Hahaha

this just made my fucking week
I wish I was that excited about my accomplishments!
‚ÄúLook at that dog go!! Wow! Oh wait that‚Äôs me!!! Go me!!!‚Äù
Aren't dogs unable to see TVs like how humans do because they lack one colour receptor in their eyes...
Hilarious.    The heart of a champion!Love the pogo jumping.
border collies are so smart :]
This is awesome
This is the most meta thing I've seen so far today.
Awww she looks just like mine! Lol that's amazing.   Thank you for sharing!
‚ÄúGO ME!‚Äù
Precious!
"GO ON ME! YAAAAY ME! WOOHOO!"
TIL: reviewing training films works for dogs too
I remember the first time i was on tv... My mom told me to get down because i was messing up the reception.
This about to break the front page
Why does it have no notes?
Legend has it she is still jumping till this day...
You can see the fast mental rerouting after that last pipe to the correct stage.
"Gods, I was strong then!"
Soo üòé

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything clever to say regarding cute doggo, so here‚Äôs my poor attempt at gold.
"That could be me some day!""Kirk, that was you. Yesterday."
Meh
This reminds me of bojack horseman
what a narcissist.
‚ÄúLook at how fast I go!‚Äù
Fantastic video. Made my day watching Kirk. Thank u for sharing!!!! Wonderful üòä
Wow that‚Äôs funny / amazing
This is awesome.
She smoked it.
This is another level of awwww
Dogs like this amaze me
Imagine having this much self confidence/ pride in yourself.
I love border Collies so much
How is it possible that I didn't notice the dog jumping in front of the TV? I guess I was focusing on something else.
Does this qualify as an audio commentary?
Border collies should be classed as non-human persons.
Dogs are very intelligent creatures! No doubt she knows she did something good
r/likeus
That's one fast dog
You probably beat your dog.
IT ME IT ME IT ME
Its like Mr. Satan watching his past championship
She‚Äôs so freaking adorable üòä
This is adorable!
I have so many theory of the mind questions.
Yay! Go me!
I have a Border Collie who is lazy. I remember when I first got them everyone told me that they are super high energy and need to be put to work so I took him on long hikes. Thirty minutes into a hike he just would roll over and relax.Right now he is laying on my couch above pillows.When I go in the backyard to go in the pool, he stays inside because he likes the AC.He just likes playing with his plush toys- Mr. Bill and elephant..by playing around I mean he just shakes them up and down like he is breaking their neck. Granted he's a Border Collie/Austrian Shepherd/Terrier/Corgie mix :)
This literally melts my heart
Hey its me!
Gotta support yourself no matter what. Always have to have your own bark, as they say
I thought it was only us and dolphins that recognise themselves in mirrors etc. She's just watching TV üòã
She‚Äôs almost coaching herself! She‚Äôs even ghosting the routine. (Jumps when running, tippy taps when going through tunnels, does jukes through poles..)
So they just named this dog without knowing it's a girl, right?  Do they have a son named Jessica?
Next show her a video of herself reacting to watching herself on TV
She *knows*.
Kirk
KOFY, Stereo TV 20, San Francisco
Those competition are so fun to watch. Sadly they are really hard to find online. Does anyone here have a good source? I mostly watch them on youtube
As always, I am amazed at how high-definition has made it possible for dogs (and cats?) to actually watch television.
  #
I remember when I wanted my nintendo dogs to be like this but they couldn't even manage to walk through those tunnel things.
Dogs are one of best gifts to humans. I'll never live without

Why does it matter that she‚Äôs a female border collie? Lol
THATS ME! THATS ME! THATS ME!
To be the best you gotta study the tapes.
She‚Äôs adorable!!! Love it üòù‚ô•Ô∏è
Can dog comprehend TVs? Do they know what is that and if it's them and they're viewing a recording of themselves and not a actual scenario through a box.
I know some species of animals can pass that self recognition test, (elephants for example, I think?) do some individuals in species that don't ever make that leap?
So cute !
Omg this is so cute
That's meaning
"I'm awesome"
This dog is so egotistical. Who watches their own performance and gets that excited.
Quiet dignity is overrated!
This is the kind of wholesome quality I need in my life. Thank you r/aww
üòç
Too bad that dogs don't recognize themselves.
Every time she jumps I hear her yell ‚Äúgo go go‚Äù
Hey everyone, come and see how good look!!
Now she knows how amazing she is.  But she already knew
She is just so precious! HUGS!
Nice!
How are Collie's so smart?Serious question. I have a rescue Pug, he's awesome, my good friend even, but I know he's a dork most of the time.
She thought it was another dog and she was cheering them on.
That's me...that's me...that's me.. Look! That's me...
lol
<3
Does the dog comprehend that she's watching herself?
She's watching film to get ready for the next match! Pro doggo! üòç
My dog doesn't even bother looking at the screen when I play something
So cute!!!!!
"hey thats me! Look it's me!"
It looks like she‚Äôs kind of acting out the course
This is the best thing ever
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!
I thought dogs couldn‚Äôt see TVs because their eyes don‚Äôt react fast enough? Clearly that‚Äôs not true though

I once watched a border collie in a city park walk up to a water fountain, stand up, fiddle around and look at it for a minute, then turn on the water and start drinking.I had to look around to make sure I wasn't being pranked.
That‚Äôs one fast boi
u/GallowBoob strikes again!
This is so adorable. It looks like she's cheering herself on.
I really hope OP is now running around a course with Kirk. She was reeeeally ready for it. :)

Damn that doggo can move
I need the longer version.
on that day, border collies around the world became self aware
"That's me!! That's me!!! look look I'm on the tele!!"
Even dogs watch film to review their athletic performance.

I really miss agility, my rough collie is too old  now to do it.
i read this as ‚Äúformer border collie‚Äù
I'm getting huge Nintendogs flashbacks
I know certain animals have been known to recognize themselves in a mirror, but is this dog saying "Hey that's me!" or is it going "Look at that dog right there!"
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen!!
Meanwhile my dog can‚Äôt even acknowledge the tv
Eh ... that's a Scottish Border Collie ...As you were .
What makes me the happiest is watching the focus on the dog‚Äôs face when she runs her course. The dog knows exactly what to do and she goes max intensity.  I have a hard time trying to get humans just to do their jobs period.
ADORABLE.
Why did I read this as ‚ÄúKirk, the former border collie‚Äù
I thought dogs couldn‚Äôt see tv because the light pattern doesn‚Äôt match up with the way their vision works or something like that
nintendogs IRL
Holy shit look at that dog fly.

Man so much energy in those beautiful dogs. I love it.
If that dog actually knew it was watching itself, I imagine it would be a mind blowing experience.
Such a good girl!
Gambate doggo!
Don't watch agility competitions much but I could sit and watch Border Collies do sheepdog trials all day long. Spend loads of time when I was younger on my granddads farm, he had few Borders so that's probably why.
That dog is insanely fast.
Is that a 1974 Curtis Mathes?

More people should know that dogs don't see the picture on the tv as humans do. And they can't comprehend what they are seeing on it, so all of these videos have reactions either to the sound or the owners words that pump up the dog.
Dog shows are animal abuse dont @ me
My cat won't even look at herself in the mirror
Brilliant!!
That's how Kanye watch his own music videos
Uncle Rico watching his old HS highlight tapes
So.. much... upvote
My own border collie became really interested in television ever since we got a flat screen TV with a higher refresh rate than the old CRT's.Apparently, dogs "flicker fusion rate" is higher than for humans. To dogs, at 60hz refresh rate, the screen would look like a flickery mess, but at higher rates, like 120hz, it looks clear to them, so they can see it kind of like we do. They are bi-chromates, so they only see limited colour range compared to us.My dog loves cartoons and scenes with animals or dramatic music.
Dats alotta upvotes

Aww, so cute! It reminds me when I used to play Nintendogs and you could enter your dog into an agility show :)
That‚Äôs such an awesome dog, I don‚Äôt think mine can even comprehend the images on a tv:

This is the cutest because she probably doesn't recognize herself, but loves so much what she does that she gets excited just by watching another dog doing it
Very cute!
That is so cute
Olly the jack russel anyone?
That is so cute!!
She is so proud of her work.
OK, so I was always taught that "dogs can't watch TV, since their brains can't parse a 2-D image". What else in my life is a huge lie?
I like how when she sees herself weaving through the poles, she imitates it a little like she‚Äôs saying‚ÄúHey look the wiggley pole trick I do that so well, see *wiggle wiggle* okay now more tricks, THIS IS SO EXCITING *ARE YOU SEEING THIS SHIT?!*‚Äù
I'm not a dog person
Im agree
If she can stay healthy, and out of trouble, she'll be a steal late in the first round.Let's hope she can stay out of Cleveland. They're definitely on the rise, but it may be a few years before a playoff berth.
I miss my border collie  Banjo sooooooooooooooooo much. He has passed and this video made me cry watching it.  It‚Äôs beautiful and I wish my boy was still around so we could do agility again.  Thank you for sharing. Kirk rocks!!!
Imagine a human doing this to it's best performance.
A female border collie? Nice try mate all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.
This doggo is so cute.
I don't think I have ever been that excited about anything.
You go girl!!!
More interesting than most of these dozy fucks whole lives though, mate.
I have four Collies, this is amazing to see!
"Look at me go! Look at me go! Im so pretty! Watch this bad ass move! Then I was like wooooom! LOOK. AT. ME. GO!!!"
I could watch this on loop for a long time.
Thank god we have dogs in our world today.
Can animals (and in this instance, dogs) recognize themselves on TV? Or do they just see it as another dog?  I would guess it's just a dog seeing another dog...if I never looked in the mirror I wouldn't know what I look like and wouldn't be able to recognize myself...i don't see dogs looking in the mirror very often.
so good

From the look on his face, Buddy doesn't look enthused about his new fitness regimen.
If you cut his nails, he will have a lot more of an easier time to be active and stay active. He will also feel a lot more comfortable in general.
That‚Äôs awesome! Your neighbor might also consider feeding Buddy less, which will help him stay at a healthy weight.
I love this so much. Thank you.
Shameless plug here but I am in Atlantic Canada and volunteer for an organization called Elderdog. They pair seniors who have dogs with volunteers who walk them and play with them. I walk 2, sometimes 3, gorgeous dogs for a senior. If you live in At.Can, or even if you don't, look into organisations near you who may also do this. It's so rewarding and keeps seniors with their dogs longer.
Buddy has made some great dogress!

How long do you walk him for? Did you have to gradually increase distance?
This is too awesome! You‚Äôre a great person!
He looks like he‚Äôs sick of your shit
That is awesome of you to help both of them!
That was very kind of you and I'm sure they both appreciate it a lot. Nice work
Holy shit how far did you walk him??
Good human does goodboy a help! Yesss.
Fat animals make me sad.Good work on giving him exercise!
How long do you walk him for? So cute
That‚Äôs so awesome man, glad to see upstanding people doing nice stuff sometimes. :)
He looks like he hates you
You are a really good person, OP! Thank you for caring for Buddy and also helping out your neighbor when she needed it! I hope you get lots of puppy kisses from Buddy!
I would like to see more posts like this.
and now they have a friend when the other one dies^^^apply ^^^that ^^^which ^^^ever ^^^way ^^^you ^^^like
This is more awesome than some of the success stories on /r/loseit. And much cuter.
Good boi gettin‚Äô gains.
Bless him and bless you.
Damn that dog is thicc
This is so touching and inspiring. Thinking about doing the same thing for my niece's Guinea pig.
Way to go! You‚Äôre making a big difference in both of their lives, thank you!
Where's the picture of the comically oversized, former collar?
He needs a pair of sunnies
:)
You are so pure
This is the most wholesome and good deed I've seen on here. Good job! And congrats little pup!
This is prime /r/HumansBeingBros content right here.
Holy crap in a hat. That was one round doggo. Good job
That's so awesome!  I'm proud of Buddy and you! <3

That‚Äôs super awesome and kind-hearted of you to do!! You rock!!! Congrats on getting healthy Buddy!
Wow what a contrast between the two photos!Thanks for being a kind human.
I can only imagine your weight loss is just as good!When we set a goal, it's not the finish line, but what happens on the way there that has the most impact in our lives.  Great job!!!
This is so sweet. Applause for your selflessness.
This world needs more people to act like this
* Pic 1: "Do I really have to move for this 'walk'?"* Pic 2: "Oh my god, Karen if I have to take one more step..."
Why he looked pissed about the weight loss
YEEEY THANK TOU MAN ALL DOGS SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU
You deserve your impending gold, OP.
Good for you man :) I walk my friend's dog too, wish I had space for a doggo
Good for you.  Excellent results!
Aaaaaawwwwwwww. Happy pupper
He also changed from a dog to an opossum
This is the cutest thing!
I‚Äôm really touched by this. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è Shine on
‚ÄúWhat have you done to meeee!!!?!!!‚Äù Eyes right there
Wholesome
You are an awesome person. Please have lots of kids.
Based Buddy
Great post but I am laughing at the face on the dog now that he is in better shape and going on walks. He does. It look thrilled!!
He looks like he fucking hates you
Now he has kind of a badass look on his face too.
He looks pissed in the right photo
You are an awesome human being!
What's cuter than doggo? Healthy doggo!
That must have been one hell of a walk!
Thanks for being good hooman to buddy and your neighbor. <3
üíùüêï
You are a good person.
Yaaay!
awesome work! he looks great
He looks like he hates you
Awww thank you for enriching this pups life and helping a senior!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
poor thing looks so old, thank you for doing such a thing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you! For being a good neighbor and doing what needed to be done. That pup is their BF. How's the 90 yr old doing. I love older people.

Fat pets like that break my heart. That is abuse!
The sad thing is that this is a form abuse even though unintentional due to the elderly owner not being able to walk, but there needs to be volunteer services for those animals.  If the elderly owner can't take care of himself then how the hell are they going to take care of a dog or cat if they can't even get out of the front door.  The sad thing is if the animal is taken away, the elderly owner will most be heartbroken since the dog or cat is their only companionship.
I'm glad you did it but honestly, the owner is to blame regardless of her age. She could have had someone all these years walk her dog.
Before Pic: "Get the fuck away with that leash.  I'm not going.  I hate you."After Pic: "You're still a dick... but thanks for saving my life."
Go Buddy and OP!!

2nd pic.  Little buddy is up to something. He's shifty.
I fucking love you for this OP
Go buddy go!
A simple act that seem nothing but has and will impact many (me included). Good karma will come to you.
Now we just gotta get people to do this
Thank you so much for helping this dog out. You make a huge diffrerence on his quality of life.
Probably saved this dog‚Äôs life!
Can you walk me?
Left: Sad little balloon!Right: Begrudingly admitting that maybe this walking thing is good for him.
His facial expression is priceless. "Y u do dis. But thx."
Proof that working out doesn't boost a dog's mood
He don't seem too proud to be slim. Must be crashing from all that cross fit bull shit
Alternative Title: Old lady commits animal abuse.
Good Hooman
You are a wonderful human!
What‚Äôs with old people and naming their dogs buddy? My great grandma had a dog named buddy
Bro buddy fuckin hates your ass
Cute little nugget!
You are a good person.
How is that the same dog
Buddy now has a jawline and resting bitch face
Lol. Looks healthier... And pissed!  I speak from experience, I exercised once - it was awful.
Buddy does not look amused.
Lol he looks absolutely miserable
And I hope you have added light to the neighbor's life.  My 84-year-old grandmother lost her dog it hurt her real bad. She missed having something around to talk to.

Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(
Nice
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
Good job OP in helping the dog out. You probably saved its life.Having said that, it actually really annoys me when old people insist on continuing to own dogs, when they clearly aren't able to look after them properly. Failing to have a dog walked is failing as a dog owner. Also that little dog was morbidly obese, which again indicates that the 90 year old owner was completely failing in their duty.I appreciate that old people can get lonely, and want company in the form of a pet, but this situation was still unacceptable. My advice to such dog owners, is to either get help if they're struggling, or consider being owned by a cat. Either way, they need to take responsibility, or not own a pet at all. /rant
People really shouldn't get pets when they're so old. It's not fair on the pets when they die and they get neglected in certain ways like this ): I'm happy you've helped her out like this though ! So kind
This warms my heart.
could be a sign of dementia or even alzheimers. my grandmother came to live with me and she kept over feeding my dog because he would beg for food and she could not remember he had already eaten. thankfully my little guy likes to chase other dogs along the fence so he ran the extra food off.
Jesus that poor dog thank you for helping him
That's animal abuse. If you can't take care of your pet, give it away.
You are awesome, your neighbor is a dog abuser. Just feeding him less would also make him not morbidly obese. I get being super old sucks, but this is animal cruelty.
Looks like a dog that barks at everyone and everything
That's animal cruelty. If you can't care for an animal, find a new home for it, where it can be much happier. "Years" is more than enough time to hire a dog walker.
Can you walk me, please? Thanks.
You are beautiful soul!
This blatantly looks like a meme.
In awe at the size of this lad.
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.
Dat face says I kill u I kill so dead

This is the sweetest! You‚Äôre an awesome human.
Awesome.   I'm sure you guys bonded as well.
Wholesome
You‚Äôre an awesome person, doing this for both your neighbor and for Buddy.
You're a good neighbor.
looking like an absolute unit on the left
It looks like a fat carry image photoshopped with a dog's head.
**from fluffo to buffo**
whyd you do it
Good hooman.
This made my day!!
You‚Äôre a great person for doing this! Thank you for helping that mutt out and increasing its quality of life.
Omg ur the best!! What a happy lil chi!
I'm sure he is happy to be outside but his better years are behind him inside of the house.
God bless you
Bet he is loving it too! Good for you, that's very kind of you.
You have given Buddy so many more years!! Hopefully he will live at least as long as your neighbor... by the time people get that old they end up losing people, pets etc all the time. Hopefully this is one less loss they will have to experience!!
Steph didn‚Äôt strike out this time. Steph hit a home run.
You gave them both a gift. The dog gets weight loss, and the owner gets to keep her dog longer.
You are so awesome helping out your senior neighbor and Buddy!
Thank you for being a good person ‚ù§Ô∏è
I started walking my 2 older chihuahuas with my new lab and they are looking really fit too! We're all getting in better shape. But I wish I'd taken a before and after of all of us first!
Loyal dog
You're the best kind of neighbor, one who cares.
He's got a whole new leash on life!

He still thicc tho! üëåüèª
You're a good human. Thank you.

You are the best hoooman in the world!
this is so pure. the content I need in my cynical existence
God bless you my dude
Sounds like a good deal!The dog gets walked and becomes healthier, and you get a dog to go outside with and start conversations.
Love the expression on the after picture. Before: I'm fat, but I'm fine.After: I fuckin' hate you Bob.
I used to walk my exes dog daily who is a corgi. Recently saw said dog and just about cried on how much weight she gained. Good on you OP for giving this pup some exercise!
r/progresspics
The only thing bigger than the poor puppy at the beginning is your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è , well done you.
SO PROUD OF YOU AND BUDDY <3 <3 <3
Awww good on you. He looks so much better üòÄ
He looks high as hell in the second photo..
Youre a great person
The dog kind of looks like it resents you for it.
He went from potato to hot dog! If you keep it up he will reach noodle tier!
I wish I could be that good of an human being. Nice job op ‚ù§Ô∏è
r/humansbeingbros r/mademesmile
Well done,  OP. Fucking well done.
Love
Probably the best before/after comparison I ever saw
This is awesome
I‚Äôm certain he‚Äôs happy but that look on the second panel is like he‚Äôs judging you. ‚ÄúI used to have a nice life lounging around....‚Äù
That's so nice of you. He looks happier too.
That's very sweet of you, you are a kind person! Buddy looks great!
Major Karma points for you my friend.
You are a hero :)
You probably gave both of them more years together!
That is amazing! Good job, Buddy.
Awwwww!!!!
Looking good Buddy.
Everyone needs someone and it's so very cool to see that you were there for someone who needed it.
You absolutely beautiful human being.
What an incredibly kind thing for you to do for both the neighbor and the dog! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great job!!
I might need you to start taking me for walks.
AWW! Give pls give him a cuddle for me üòç
Thank you for taking great care of this good boy!
Who a good human
You are a hero!
That's so kind of you!!
I've done that. Lots of elderly people in this neighborhood so I've walked their dogs.One pair of dogs I walked for three years. Really sad when they moved away. And now no one walks those dogs.
Delivered pizza for a living. Can confirm a lot of old people have an overweight pupper to greet you at the door.
He looks more miserable..
All good things considered, the after image looks like hes seriously gotten sick of your shit.
Sweet of you to help out.
Yeah, he looks thrilled.
Poor old lady and doggo. His mommy doesn't have the strength to walk him
Well done! You have a generous heart, to do this for Buddy and your neighbor.
You know she added you to her will ......your getting the dog <3
He looks pissed about it. ‚ÄúGod damn, picking me up and taking me from my house can‚Äôt believe this shi- I‚Äôm out OF BREATH MELANIE OK‚Äù
Congrats to you and the dog. Looks like you both have had quite the transformations lately!
Buddy looks like a real chick magnet :)
well done! Other people may see it and turn a blind eye to it but you chose not to ignore it. My dad was 86 years old and he had neighbors who always looked out for him and it really give me peace of mind that they did I didn't live very far away and neither did my sister's so we were there often but we knew when we couldn't make it like an inclement weather that he could count on them to help him maybe shovel his driveway or you know just things like that for him and it made all the difference in the world
Can you take me for walks too, i need to lose weight üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Good lad. He's looking in great shape. Can't believe just how round he was before.
You ROCK!
He‚Äôs not your buddy, pal.
\>that expression in the second picture  You know he knows he's better and healthier, but he doesnt' like it and want you to know it
#TransfomarionTuesdayGood job!
I hope to have before and after photos like these
Exactly what I was expecting to see owned by a 90 year old lady.
Everyone should create an alt account to upvote this twice
No doubt both Buddy and his mama are happy to have you as a neighbor. He looks so much better!
Skinny boi
It might not seem like much but this favor has more impact than you might realize...You are keeping an elderly person‚Äôs companion healthy, happy and alive. It‚Äôs proven that elderly people can live longer and are happier when they have a beloved pet. She is probably so relieved that he gets exercise and I bet she enjoys seeing you too. It‚Äôs always great to take initiative and do a kind deed but you have taken this a step further.  You saw a simple way that you could help and committed to it! By doing so you‚Äôve improved someone else‚Äôs (lady and dog‚Äôs) quality of life!
The second photo looks like Buddy's slowly realizing something about you. Like he was thinking about how much easier his life's been lately - being able to walk better, run again, and even jump onto the couch. And he thinks "Wait a minute, did this human teach me how to do these things again? Before I met her I'm sure I couldn't move so fast. It was you, wasn't it? My legs are better because of you, you sly dog."
What breed is that? It looks like a house elf.
since when did dogs master angling pictures?
The dog has the I rather be fat face
You're doing a great thing.
Love it! You're a good hooman
Hes makin nore progress than me. Good job lil buddy
That is so fucking nice of you. That's what's living is all about Helping those ones who can't do it. This makes me happy good job buddy!!!
Aww I hope you tell your neighbor that the internet loves her and her doggo!
He looks very polite in the one to the left.
I see two tails on the first photo. What happened to that one?
100k in 5 hours?! Holy shit.
Gj, but in some other states the police would have taken care of the issue by taking the dog from her.
i love you. you are a hero to me.
You're telling me getting out and moving made that dog lose weight?  I figured it needed a miracle product like fit tea or herbal life...
From thicc to slicc.
üò≠üò≠ poor doggie
This is so pure!
You‚Äôre a good person
Ok..time to start taking myself for walks and lose some of these extra lbs.Thanks for the inspiration Buddy!
This is lovely - you are a good human being! The idea of carrying Buddy partway and making him walk back is a great idea! Well done both!
We adopted a dog named Buddy when his human had to enter an assisted living facility.  He too was overweight and clumsy, but he's a new man these days.  Fit and agile and just the sweetest little guy.  He loves his new pack.
He looks very unamused at his progress
Hey man, can you walk me? I got 15 pounds I would like to lose.
Maybe added years to OP's life too.  Win, win.  Great Job!
Yeah he totally looks thrilled about it.
Such a wonderful thing you‚Äôve done, both for the pup  and your neighbor.  I‚Äôve done Meals on Wheels for years and there are so many elderly who are isolated. Sometimes the people who  are delivering meals might be the only people they see all week.  There so much kindness in what you‚Äôre doing.  Thanks for being a part of this world.
Buddy does not look amused.
From CHONK to HONK
Jeez all that weight after 1 walk? You're a miracle worker
Walking the dog and enriching his life is fantastic. Doing this for your neighbor, makes you an amazing human being! Way to be an awesome neighbor that I would be happy to live next to. Kudos!
Now this is worthy of 100 Up votes! üôèüôèüôè
You are a great person! Xoxo
Right on OP! Super nice for your to do for the dog and your neighbor.
May I be next?
I would love this arrangement.  I get a dog to walk but I don't have to be home by a certain time to let him/her out to pee :-)
That's absolutely adorable
I wonder if he saved his skinny jeans
Dude, nice.  I can definitely see those jaw gains and the lats are doing well too.  What body fat percentage is your dog?  Also, how much does he bench?  I'm trying to achieve that same ripped physique.  Can you also provide a diet plan?  Thank you so much.
Buddy doesn't looked too thrilled!
Thanks for helping out. I had to take a dog from a senior who could no longer care for their dog. She weighed 26 lbs. She lost 6.lbs and fits in with my other three dogs. She is now loving and happy. It makes me happy whenever I look at her. You‚Äôll benefit from your efforts.
Can you walk me?
Buddy looks like he‚Äôs seen some shit
This is so amazing!Congrats!/r/HumansBeingBros
Aw, he looks fantastic! You‚Äôre a good person for doing this. My Nan is 76 and my brother walks her dog three times a week. The vets are pleased with her weight loss and the movement helps her tired old bones, plus she gets out of the house for half an hour to smell all the smells. I‚Äôm so glad there are good people out there to help animals.
Are these nails supposed to be cut?
Thank you for loving animals üê¢‚ù§Ô∏è
You‚Äôre a good person. I salute you
You rock!
This is beautiful. Well done you and well done Buddy! Such a gorgeous little face!
Do you also walk the bunnies in your avi?  I know someone w a rabbit named Kevin and I‚Äôm still not over it.  Like, I think ab Kevin the rabbit at least 4x  a week
Buddy looks tired of your shit. Or maybe he's just tired.
Such a precious nugget. So kind of you to help your neighbor and Buddy <3
I‚Äôm shocked the bot didn‚Äôt jump in to say ‚ÄúTHIS LOOKS LIKE A PROGRESSION PIC‚Äù
Wow all in one walk
Awwwww, good for you...Proud of you!
Yay!
Buddy doesn't look too happy about it
Felicidades!.
Cute
Neighbours have a golden. She's old and adorable and I've never seen her be walked in the year we've lived in this house. I want to so badly to offer to walk her! They've got kids at an appropriate age to walk her too. She's always running across the street to the field and wants to play. It breaks my heart.
How nice!
Well done.
Hi Buddy. You are sooo handsome. Congrats on your weight loss. I just fell in love with a guy named Buddy.
Great job, dudette
Love this x
That 2nd photo of though... "bitch took my food from me".
This makes me so happy! That‚Äôs so kind of you.
Good hooman
And mental health.
Is that a cat's tail in the first pic?Are you not walking the cat?
150k Upvotes in 13 hours, wow.
You are doing god's job, son
He did look happier when fat tho. Or maybe you walked him too early on the morning.
I used to have a Chihuahua that really loved it when we would take her out for walks but hated actually walking because she would get tired because she was incredibly fat, and she wouldn't lose weight. She passed away because some stomach problems caused by her love for food that was meant for a way bigger dog we had and depression by being separated üòÖ
This has got to be the most wonderful short story I've read today. Thank you for this, OP. Buddy, in his second pic, looks like he doesn't want to participate in everything you put him through, but I'm sure he's happy. Such a cute dog! p.s. Have his owner cut his nails.
Don't use this word lightly, but true Hero.
Awww look at the little sausage
Buddy looked like a giant tick w/ four legs but now looks so much healthier.
Good hooman and pupper
Kudos....I think you did a really kind act that was giving both to your neighbor and the little doggie. I wish my neighbors were so nice!
He doesn't look so happy about it ...
I wish someone made me go for walks lol
That dog doesn't look happy about the diet :D
Thank you for stepping up!! <3
Thank you for doing a kind deed today ‚ù§Ô∏è
üé∂I‚Äôm too sexy for this leash!üé∂
My dog loves human scraps and gets into the cats food all the time, I think the only reason she's a skinny bitch is because I walk her excessively, but where as that works for her it has not worked for me, lol dog metabolisms are next level.
Never thought about dog owners who can‚Äôt walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don‚Äôt have family to help, I wonder if there‚Äôs like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.&#x200B;&#x200B;
I read it like ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt walked the dog in 90 years‚Äù üòÇüòÇ

#THIS MAKES ME SO FUCKING HAPPY
You are the bestest good grrl person ever!!
Hey can you help me next?
I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but this is one of the reasons old people shouldn't have pets that they can't fully take care off themselves
Are you sure it wasn't just a big ugly domesticated rat?
What an asshole if you can‚Äôt walk your poor dog have someone do it for you that‚Äôs not fair for buddy :(
r/progresspics
From R O U N D  B O I to L E A N  B O I.
Thats one fat sumbitch
That is why old people should not have young dogs, they should have like a parrot or a cat
so you're saying that a little activity goes a long way? That can't be. Weight loss is more than eating less and moving more! That dog has outstanding genes! Or maybe the dog is doing keto and intermittent fasting. Do you add apple cider vinegar into the dog's water to melt the fat off? Is the dog following an organic, clean diet? How long it took you to detox the dog? /s
He's not fat. Just big boned
I know that it‚Äôs terrible for their health but fat animals are cute af
Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(
On the left: happy and chubby On the right: "it's 95¬∞ out Steph where are my dammed biscuits?!"
Thank you! From all the dog lovers in the world, especially the dog lovers that need extra help to keep our pups healthy.
/r/dogresspics
Wow, awesome. This is great. Taking care of elders and animals. Good for you, OP. My faith in humanity has increased in ratings.
That dog looks 90 years old
This works for humans too....get off your ass and move more if your overweight
Holy fuck that dog looks like a snake after a huge mealI have one similar to it but she refused to walk on the leash so she just collects mass, pretty soon we're gonna start to orbit her :(
Heckn good looking
I hate to write it, but...she really should think of allowing you to adopt her dog.  She can't help her dog be healthy anymore, it's time to give him to someone that can.
You shouldn't own a fucking dog if you refuse to walk it, really is sad when people abuse their pets like this, being old isn't an excuse either, you can get a mobility scooter and have him walk along side...
You saved life of this dog. Lool at him and his over weight. You give him more years for live. Im so proud on you. Thanks for saving dog. Who have this dog is 100% no lifer or he does not have heart for animals. Dog is so polite. He does not seen nature many years.
Are you positive his name isn't [Ferdinand](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tomandjerry/images/c/cf/Tom_and_Jerry_The_Movie_-_Ferdinand_holding_Jerry.png/revision/latest?cb=20150414015354)?
You go girl
He looks peeved at you
Nice, especially nice.
Your a good boy/girl, strikoutsteph.
That‚Äôs the best thing for a dog. A walk, daily, if not two or three times.
Awk them ears!
Apparently it helped you lose weight too
Posts like this make me proud to be human!
Just out of curiosity, what breed is that dog? It‚Äôs just so adorable üòçüòç

TBH he looks more proud in the first picture lol

Where did Buddy go number 1 and 2 at before?  Just wherever in the house?
What breed is this? Its cute but also kinda oddlooking.
Buddy in the second photo kind of looks like Ethan from H3H3
OP did something good. Give gold guys.
Awwwwww go you and buddy! It is so nice to see someone do something for someone that is completely selfless
Awwwww. You added years to that baby‚Äôs life. Kudos to you and that hard working Buddy! üíñ
You‚Äôre a good person.  Buddy is a lucky dude!
A very sweet and nice
Now that‚Äôs a glowup!
This is a great way to show the elderly we care. Great idea and blessings upon you for your kindness.
WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THIS?! üò±
Great job! You probably added a few years to this dog's life span. Also, is this Austin, bc that dog looks super familiar to me?
Thank you for being a great human!
Aww so glad for Buddy! He probably feels a lot better!

As well you should be. Good for you for being such a good neighbor.
Damn i told myself i'd have a transformation picture like this dog by the end of the summer smhh might be too late
Aww buddy looks great and so much happier! Thank you for sharing this. This is the kind of stuff we need more of!
We're proud of you! Buddy
Also - I like how in photo 1 - Buddy‚Äôs tail is in front of him but also TRAILS OFF BEHIND HIM. Honestly - there is some sci-fi shit going on with this dog. Side note - Good work OP. He looks awesome.
Well done!
Why is he giving you the stink eye?
Come walk me my trainer sucks
Look at that boy. Just look at that boy. He is my buddy too.
You are seriously the best kind of person. Keep doing that you‚Äôre doing.

Whats the time difference between the two pictures OP?

It still looks equally as upset with you as before.  Where do you think it got that face from?
this first picture looks like he's worried you're going to take him on a walk. the second pic looks like his fears were confirmed.
This is the real shit. Thanks OP ‚ù§
I love buddy!!!!
That‚Äôs awesome. Nice job.

He looks happy, like he knows he looks good. Should also post on progress subreddit

You are a saint.
r/absoluteunit
Beautiful! Great job my friend
r/FatPups
He doesn't look too proud in the second picture :P
Such an awesome person you are to help that sweet little pupper and their hooman!!
Your dogs must be pumped about his existence. "Look, there goes Buddy on a walk with OUR hooman."
This is hysterical. There is a woman that just moved on my block who also had a horribly obese dog named buddy, also owned by her mom who couldn't walk him. I get to watch his weight loss each walk. I should have thought of a before/after photo, because man is that one MASSIVE dog.
Is it just me or is he giving us the look at my new sexy body look on the right pic?
I'd crosspost this on /r/loseit ;)
So nice of you!!!!
This is a transformation story I can get behind lol way to go Buddy !!!
That's awesome of you!
Adorable
Go Buddy Go! üëè
 I read that as 90yo dog at first. But that‚Äôs awesome, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs much more comfortable with some of that weight off him. Such a cute pup!
Good job buddy!
This guy walks
Great positive influence in the world!!
Damn, how far did you walk? ;)
So sweet
r/progresspics
OP your an awesome dude!
Dog's best friend. Nicely done.
You are an amazing person OP!
Thank you for adding years to his life, and saving him from knee and back problems ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è also a nice little visit for your neighbor every day. You‚Äôre a good soul ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
He doesn't seem very proud though.
Before he was an absolute unit. Now hes just a lil chub.
This is the best post I have seen on Reddit this week, thank you OP for being a brilliant human being
No one else noticing the dog giving him the stink eye? He's like "why did you make me do this, I'm now gonna freeze to death cus i have no hibernation flubber"
Buddy is a Relative Unit now.
Face gainz!OP, you are a good soul. May the Universe bless you.
r/AbsoluteUnits
Good on you!
Dog's are awesome. Life is simple for them, and caring for them reminds me of the simplicities in life we take for granted.
 long nails!
Also I'm sure the neighbor appreciates having some one stop by so that it something happens some one can at least call for help.
You're so awesome! You're helping both doggo & human ( both you & the dog owner)üòÅ
He‚Äôs looks like he hates you for it. Good job helping him out!
Needs more spray tan in second pic
Can you take me out for a walk from time to time?
Buddy aged.
Awww, little guy was plump as a pickle
Br√∏th√™r may ƒ´ hav√¶ the l√∂√∂ps
He looked happier while he was fat
haha he looks pissed you got him off his ass. I wonder if a pampered fat dog really cares if they‚Äôre fat, not like they‚Äôre getting laid.
How old is he?
Thank you so much for this, you have extended Buddy's life and made it a happier one too.
you are a Super Hero!!! yay!
She reminds me of my little Micah Sue. I got her from my mil and she was SO fat! She lost a bunch of weight,but she remained chunky until she passed. She was the friendliest dog ever and I miss her sweetness so much
You look great Buddy
U rock
The dog looks sick wtf Did you do to it?
Must've been a long walk!
This should be under ‚Äúhumansbeingbros‚Äù subreddit as well.
r/progresspics is quaking!
Someone please do this to me
His eyes just shine with gratitude lol
Do you know how much weight he lost? He looks so great! You are a wonderful human for doing this.
I like how you serve the community. Thank you.
Op thank you for being a good human.
Can you take me out for a walk?
r/absoluteunits
My 40yo able-bodied neighbor with an even more able-bodied teenage son hasn‚Äôt mowed their lawn in years, come mow their grass!
OP, you are Awesome.
Coincidentally, i also have a small dog named Buddy, but he loves walking; It's our other female small dog that is lazy and fatter
You are amazing for doing that.  It makes such a difference in their lives.One thing though, if he is gaining weight without being walked, he is eating too many calories.  Advise the owner to check with their vet on how many calories he needs at a resting rate.  From there the vet can advise on how much food when walking.  Also no treating outside those calories.
Is your neighbor dog actually buddy? I'm just asking cause back when I was a kid my first dog I named buddy as well ü§£Miss that good lazy boy
Snoop Dogg, is that you?
Go buddy!
I need more people like you in my life. People who care about others.
Consider that dog yours.
Wow! He looks great! Awesome job!
Amazing! I tried crossposting this to r/progresspics for a little bit of fun (crediting you and this post of course), but their stipulations made it difficult (title must be in format "F or M/age/height/200lbs > 140lbs = 60lbs Weight loss progress." Anyway, if you can figure all that out it might be some easy karma!
Poor dog
Buddy‚Äôs face doesn‚Äôt look like he enjoyed the weight loss
üòáüòáüòá
Wow dude, that's really considering of you. Buddy's looking great!
Aww what a goooooood booooooy he loves u sm now!!!
Great job Buddy and To You for your dedication and selflessness!!! We need good stories like these:-)^_^
That's a hot dog
That dog just wants to smoke a blunt and watch Clifford
Looks like an old dog can learn a few new tricks ! If by a kind helping hand (:
Daaaaaamn
He's got that old man grumpy face lol"I'm doing this for her not for you..l
Good boye does a thiccoms
Fitboye
You should post this to r/progresspics I have a male mini dachshund that went through a weight transition and his photos got a lot of karma (alt account). He went from 23 to 12 pounds, needless to say, our fur babies are way happier and healthier!
Good boys!!!
He looks slightly suspicious of you.
why does no one asked where he went to the toilet all those years?
You are good human. A very good human.
Absolute Unit
I love there are people like you!!! ‚ù§‚ù§Good human!!!!
You are a good neighbor/person!!!
Good for you OP. That dog would thank you if it could talk.
Good human.
He looks so mad. Maybe he was happy with who he was? You ruined him.
You‚Äôre good people
He looks the same
When my old roommate and I moved into together, I started walking his elderly dog, which I don‚Äôt think had happened in years.  This dog went through a crazy transformation.  He wasn‚Äôt fat to begin with, but he did build some impressive muscle.  It was the happiest I‚Äôd ever seen him.  Even when he was inside he was more active‚Äî he didn‚Äôt just sit around anymore.  Cocoa died 3 months after I moved out.
Nice bro.
You are a good person.
I love that you carried him out.  I knew people who had a dog who wouldn't want to walk out but would walk home, so they used a baby stroller to get him to the walk point. He sat so nicely in it and it was canopied so you wouldn't know a dog was in there instead of a baby until you got close. Surprise!
Herbert?
He even looks like he's smiling again. At least as much as a feisty chihuahua would. :)Well done, OP.
>!You are an angel.!<

GG You have your place in heaven because of that Work :D My friend
This SO made my day!!!!
Anyone else notice how resentful he looks after the transformation? lol
You‚Äôre a saint.Thanks for doing this.
That is a look of hatred if I have ever seen one üòÇ
On the right he looks like "enough walking already jfc"
You are a good man.

How long did this transformation take? Did the owner change his diet at all?
That dog looks so pissed off
Reminds me of my aunt's fat ass jack Russell

Where... where would he poop before?
Good job
Thank you for your service!üíóüíóüëèüëè
he looks so much younger, even with the grey hairgj
Amazing!
Lol I don't think he's grateful
Man, this is just really fucking awesome.
He looks way healthier but not happier
CUT HIS NAILS THO
That is so awesome you did that for your neighbor's dog! He really needed the exercise! Buddy looks great!
Aww üíï so wholesome
He looks pissed that you walked it

Thank you!!!!!! We need more of you in the world!! When I was a home hospice caregiver all of my clients pets were horribly out of shape because they weren‚Äôt capable of walking them :(. So amazing of you to step up, keep being the best!!!!
You are a good person. ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂
You rock OP.
OP you‚Äôre a good person.

I'm sure Buddy is greatful for you kindness. You're a nice hooman.
Jesus. I‚Äôm surprised the dog let itself get that fat. If I haven‚Äôt walked my dog, he will just sprint around the yard chasing flies until he gets out all of his wiggles
Oh I guess Buddy loves his new body :)
I believe this is what you call a certified good boy
Thank you being a wonderful person.
I have a two year old rescue who is terrified of the leash-erupts into shakes when I even take it out.  Have tried just about everything-and she‚Äôs getting fat because I can‚Äôt figure out how to walk her.  We went to a trainer who suggested giving her treats while wearing the leash, putting her leash near her food, etc but she still hates it.  Any advice would be appreciated!
Good person you are.
You are an angel!
Looks like he could use a Mani Pedi too! Could be wrong though I don't own a dog üòã
Modern day hero.
Nice!
r/absoluteunits
Thank you!
why do I feel bad when I see fat dogs and cats.
First photo: fat and happy; Second: lean and mean
My Daughter and son in law got a Australian Shepherd puppy. They both work, so I go over Monday through Friday and train and walk her@ 3  /  1/2 yr old pup. Can do these things : sit, stay, heel, shake both paws, lay down, roll over, crawl, come when called and she will lay down off to my side while I get her food and I place her food bowl down and she sits until I say go eat. Train them young, they‚Äôre like sponges.Great job on the weight loss on that older dog.Keeping an older dog fit is extremely important! What you did will make the dog healthy, but also getting more time with his best friend.I‚Äôm over doing my message, but that‚Äôs what dog lovers do!!

This is a wonderful thing, makes me really happy to read this! For how long have you walked Buddy?
I‚Äôm so proud!

He's kinda smirking in the second pic
Everyone looks fatter when they sit down thoo lol
Dobby is free elf now.
Fucking yay! BUDDYZ!
Good for you!  The world needs more people like you!
Buddy now has a look of confidence/subtle arrogance rather than concern in his face.Good on you...
Not all heroes wear capes.
Weight loss and a dog...welcome to the top
What a transformation! üëçüèº
There's a special place in heaven for you.
Awesome :)
That's nice. Everyone needs to exercise and see new things. It's good for his physical and mental health.
You should take her to be put down........the 90y/o not the dog
You're an awesome human!
(Sigh) what a guy/girl!
Not going for walks is a problem, but the dog's weight problem is on his diet. He probably eats too much or people give him junk food.

How long did it take from 1st pic to the 2nd? Year or months or weeks? Have no idea how it is for a dog :)
Dog loses weight.
really nice of you
You are a good person.
Can't people just do something nice and never tell anyone about it? I dare any of you.
He is not impressed tho. 'Weirdo humans always with their weird ideas'.
Is there another dog or cat in the first pic? I see a tail...
Proud of you a s human!
Got to love pet owners who can‚Äôt be responsible for them.
I love how the dogs of old people look like old people. The second pic is such a perfect hide-the-pain old person smile.
I'm gonna cry.
You‚Äôre an angel.
Aww cute little guy
Glo up
You made my day!
His expression though in the one where he's on the leash says he hates you
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to walk a dog to keep its weight in check.  It‚Äôs all about proper amount of food to feed.  Either way, good on you for making him healthier.
How long between pictures? And that's an amazing thing you did üòÄ
I've never seen something so wholesome.
An absolute unit
He looked happier before
Wholesome
The world needs more people like you.
You are a good person , that's for sure!
Buddy appreciates this more than you know! Thanks on his behalf... Your a good person
Thank you for doing this. You‚Äôre a true angel!!
 H guy I'll 8N
TIL:  I should walk myself.
You are a really nice person to do something nice like that. God Bless
You are an earth angel. God bless.
So how fat is your neighbor?
I know he's healthier but in the second pic he has the "I'm already sick of this shit" face
Yes!
You just added years to his life, nice job.
Well keep the good work and soon he'll be at his healthy BMI üòÄ
I live in an older neighbourhood, I wonder if there's money in this...

Should probably post this on r/progresspictures
Awww hims is a little lump, but I‚Äôm glad he lost weight!
Yesssss üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
I hope your neighbour's doing ok, seeing as she hasn't took her dog for a walk in a while.
Nice
That's so kind of you :) Heartwarming to see how much healthier he is, he looks like a very sweet dog ‚ô°
That dog looks like it went through a tour in Vietnam in the second picture.
nice job bro
Lose up to 30 pounds WITHOUT dieting - you‚Äôll NEVER believe what she looks like now
this is the cutest ever<3
Buddy went from Meme to Lean.
He doesn't look any happier
Where is the progress flair
Why does he look like he‚Äôs about to cry.
You have a big heart
Good on you OP! Keep being an excellent person.
Dude you are a good human!
God bless you, the old lady, and her dog.
A good caption goes a long way.
This makes me very happy.  Best thing ive seen on the internet today. thanks!
Lol, I love the dogs look after the weight loss. It's that, "I see what you tricked me in to" look.
If he isn't an absolute unit anymore, does that make him a /r/relativeunit?
lol the dog is looking at you like imma kill you in your sleep
Wow!!! Great job. üëçüèº
what an absolute unit!
A buddy named Buddy. Well put
Good for you! He looks bitter about it though haha
Great job op
Great work ! 1000 karma-points
That lad is an absolute unit
Awesome job on saving the dog (and owner) from a premature pup death. The dog is very cute super fat. Something about overweight animals charms the pants off me. They can't(shouldn't be) overweight, but when they are it's sadorable.
His fur even got a tan! Haha! Nice job!!!
After he should be able to walk u..üòÅ
Now you inherit a dog
This is from the bottom of my heart guys. I really don't get how so many people are moved (me included) by this dog probably gaining a few years, but eat pigs and other virtually similar beings and 3 meals a day
The dog might out live the owner now
OMG IM SO PROUD OF BUDDY
Good for Buddy!!!
ProgressPics
Faith in humanity restored
He probably feels like a new man!
God bless you
You have done something amazing my friend God Bless you
he looks like he's having a meltdown in the second picture, unfortunately.
Thank you for looking out for your elderly neighbor. I‚Äôm sure it means so much to her.
Those are happyboy eyes, kudos op
what a fuckin' cutie!
Wow what a good person you are. I hope good things come your way.
Either fake or a girl needing attention for a good deed
He needs a pair of sunnies
Aww..little buddy is doing great! So cute..love this.
MOOD!
I can‚Äôt tell you how happy this makes me. I always feel sorry for dogs being loved to death.
In awe at the size of this lad...
Buddy looks like an arsehole
Pic on the right looks like he wants to die
So awesome that you did this!!! It‚Äôs not often enough that people in my generation(‚Äò86) do things like this. It seems like most younger people cannot be bothered to help or even interact with the people around them. Great job helping him out!
That is a lot of karma
Share it in /progresspics
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this but you not only helped him out physically but mentally as well. Dog's need to be walked. There is no activity that can replace that. Just letting them in the back yard is not the same mentally as walking is. Granted Buddy is old and doesn't need much anymore but for younger dogs this can be detrimental to their development.In Buddy's case, this small bit of exercise probably made him feel more "dog" that he has in a while and I bet he is more active around the house and not just sitting there like a sausage.Good on you. Now just get those nails clipped!
Want to post this to /r/prawwgresspics too? That sub could use some love.
You are a wonderful person! How did you approach the subject?
You are amazing!!
You are doing a wonderful thing for both the neighbor, and the dog. She has someone checking in on her regularly, and the dog gets some fresh air and sunshine. Plus, Buddy probably feels much better than he did before.
My dog was named buddy
What if the dog liked being able to roll around?
I have the same carpet
Big unit to healthy unit
She probably fed him once every second day
whoag
One simple act of kindness and you gave that dog its life back and brought happiness to a senior citizen. One simple act of kindness can change so much.
That was one thicc dog
your doing gods work
Awwwww
is this loss
Very good job! Movement is so Important for him
Such a cute weight loss story, so nice of you to help out! Although, I have to admit I'm kind of jealous of Buddy, I want someone to successfully convince me to exercise!

Good for you and for Buddy!
He looks depressed now
I'd give you gold if I could my friend !
Jesus christ, the poor thing...
This is incredible. That dog's quality of life just shot up thanks to you.

I wish I could marry a girl like you OP
It‚Äôs hard being 90
It looks like a super cool dog!
You're a great human! This fills me with joy. (:

You‚Äôve done good. Society Thanks you.
This is the most wholesome post I‚Äôve ever seen on reddit. I love old dogs!
How old is he?
Where did he go to use the bathroom before that?
This is awesome. Good on you.
I lol'ed then I felt bad then i loled again.
My mom needs to do the same thing
That musta been a LOT of poop!
Buddy looks absolutely disgusted with you
That's so sad! I'm glad you are doing the good deed! So awesome!
This is amazing, heck yeah op you probably gave him a few more years of life and  it probably makes his owner so happy.
He's one skinny boi now
You are fucking awesome üëå
Haha such a fat cute doggy
Thank you so much for doing this, you are wonderful person.  How much did he weigh when you started and how much does he weigh now?  Give the good boy some green beans (amazing "treat" for weight loss, canned pumpkin too) from me!
So wonderful!!  What a great person you are!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm sorry if someone already asked, but how long did this take?
Awesome
This is so sweet, the world needs more of you OP!
Buddy has Yoda ears
Is it just me or does the after picture make the dog look like he is really pissed?
Can you stop by and walk me too... I am in big need!!
Such a nice thing to do
Kind of off topic, but how do I convince my mom to buy real dog food for our dog? I'm getting worried because I know breaded chicken patties can NOT be good for him.
He looks tired
Lol what a fat bastard. I actually like the old pic more
That‚Äôs awesome
I love you for this.
What a good boy
That second pic is the look of satisfaction, if I ever.
It looks like there is another dog in the first picture, what happened to that one?
I see the tail of another dog! What about that one!?
My 85 year old grandparents had a dog named Buddy that died from complications of diabetes. I remember when I was younger I was doing yard work for them as a part time job and my grandmother would make me lunch. One day I went in to see a sandwich and she was cooking bacon. I was pumped and was like "oh I love bacon on my sandwiches." To which she responded "Oh... I can make more, this bacon is for Buddy." The poor dog was basically a round table near the end.
That dog hates you.
aww such a good heart
thank you for taking the time :)
What a good pupper
Wow! That is so awesome!! üôÇ
Buddy looks like he is sick of your bullshit.JK: you are a good neighbor
What a great transformation!! Goes to show that it starts with a simple walk
Dog: ( he-help me.)
Thank you for being a good human
How long was this transformation?
that‚Äôs awesome. my grandma lived alone in her latter years and was unable to walk her dog buddy. fortunately there was a young neighbor fella who would do it for her. they actually became friends and would watch baseball games together.
Put this on r/loseit!
You've done this fellow a good service!
You are so cute!
Wow, you‚Äôre a saint. Unfortunately some old folks end up ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù neglecting their pets. Thanks for paying attention and stepping up for the little guy. That made my day.
Thank you very much for doing this,we need more people like you...proud of body,he is so cute!!
You are an incredible person. Do you have your own Buddy? If not, get ready!

What is the furry thing on the left though?
You‚Äôre awesome
so proud of your support!!!! good samaritan points filling your goblet of good!!!
Crosspost this to r/progresspics
This is everything! Thank you for doing this!
Dang I thought the pic on the left was pikachu
It looks like he despises you though.
Can you take me next?
jesus poor guy. dogs need walks. not like human need dogs exist for walks, this dog wouldve been depressed as fuck.
I used to know a dog named buddy, he too was pretty obese and old; the owner himself could barely walk most of the time, and the dog sadly died to some form of cancer afterwards ;(It hurt seeing a creature in so much pain.
That‚Äôs sweet thank you for helping Buddy and your neighbor
Love that the before photo is like ‚Äúoh god don‚Äôt look at me‚Äù
Thank you!
It‚Äôs 4:33pm PST and this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day.
Oh my word my heart!! Thank you for doing this!!!
This is a wonderful idea and good for everyone!
Go Buddy!  (Nice work strikeoutsteph!)
That dog doesn't look too well..
Great job buddy
thank you for sharing this :)
That is so wonderful, thank you so much for doing that for your neighbor, and of course the dog. I hope your life is as wonderful. üòé
Will he take his nails being clipped and a diet change? Good on you!!
Hahaha. He actually looks less happy in the second photo.
He a thicc boi
aww you have a good heart :)
you made the dog happy
That's great of you
The pic on the left looks like the ‚ÄúI shidded and farded and peed and camed‚Äù dog
r/absoluteunit
Well done OP and Buddy! The folks over at r/progresspics would like this too.
This is like Joey coco Diaz in dog form.
You're a saint üíùüòáAlso, if you think about it the dogs expression in the second photo is hilarious in comparison to the first, it's like the puppy version of being halfway between a stank face and a sneeze.
Awe he‚Äôs adorable good for you that‚Äôs wonderful
So sweet. He looks happier too!
Great story!
Oh thats why you guys walk your pets
It would have been so satisfying to watch the dog go home after a long walk and be tuckered out.
Great work so far :) Might be worth a trip to the vet for a nail clip too
Aww! Amazing. Probably feels so much better!üòä
OP that‚Äôs awesome and so nice of you
He looks like he doesn‚Äôt want to walk lmao
I work at an animal shelter and one of my biggest pet peeves (pun intended) is obese animals so you my friend are a god damn hero to me...and Buddy.
I would say poor guy but I'm really glad he's doing better now, great work! :)
He's definitely holding resentment toward you in the second pic lol
Look at his face. He knows how sexy he is after losing all that weight. Hahaha.
He looks so happy! /s
Why does he look worse in the second picture?
Why doesn‚Äôt she have over 100,000 karma
You. Are. Awesome!
Way to go buddy!
you are awesome
That's awesome to see. I understand that your neighbor is probably largely immobile at this point, but it sucks seeing a dog not being cared for properly.
I'm glad you helped this pupper but now he just looks tired.
Buddy is THICCCCC!!!!!!
Dog looks straight up pissed that you made it exercise
 In awe of the size of this lad Absolute unit
r/loseit
Well done..........now start walking your neighbors pets owner.
Who's a good boy?
While the dog has lost a lot of weight, he also looks absolutely exhausted, and miserable in the after photo. 10/10 weight loss.
It is great that you volunteered to walk your neighbors dog instead of just complaining that she was not walking it. It shows you care about the dog and can be seen by the amount of weight the dog has lost.
Good job, but the look on his face... he's so skeptical!
Thank you for doing this! I‚Äôm sure the owner and doggo are so happy!
This is the look of a dog that either is stubbornly walking but hates it, or hates getting his picture taken hahaha but kudos on being a stellar person!
You are a good person.
Omg he looks so healthy how old is he?
Chubby doggo --> Less chubby doggo. YES!
What a champ!
Good work! üê∂üíï

You are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You‚Äôre the best kind of person!
So awesome. He looks so much better. Thanks for sharing & for caring
This is amazing! You‚Äôre awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
You‚Äôre an angel ‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulations Buddy!!
Absolute bin it to the left
Sending love x
What is that dog eating?
You are a great person and Buddy looks great üíú
Omg Buddy is the cutest lil dog I ever saw
He looks like a grumpy old version of Danny Devito
That‚Äôs so kind of you! Good job Buddy!
Buddy looks happier for it. Great mentoring!
Good neighbor!üëçüëç
That face in the second picture!!! Little fucks were given lol
L
There‚Äôs a lesson here for all of us
Myspace angles..
If the 90yo neighbor didnt walk her dog for years? Who did then? Or did the dog shit and pee inside??
Wow good on you for doing that. It makes me sad to see obese animals. That dog is probably so much more happy now
Woof watchers
Oh my goodness. What a cute lil nugget
Is the Cat in the left picture as obese as the doggie was before it rejoined real dog life outdoors? I ask, because while I like dogs, I love Cats and the tail in the left picture looks like the tail of an equally obese Cat. Maybe a scratch temple would help?
Adorable little thing.Post-weight loss. :)  Nice work. :)
Looks like he hasn't been to a vet or groomer in years.  Clip those nails for him too while your at it.  This is why un supervised 90 year olds shouldn't have pets.  90 years is too old to be trusted with anything more important than a breadbox, and when you get a dog you are being entrusted with the care and wellbeing of a living animal.  I think we can raise our standards.
Awwww. How did he get so fat though? Does she not have a garden?
You have probably added years to this dog‚Äôs life! You have done a great thing here.
Cross post to progress pics?
Is this weight loss
Looks like a fucking rat
I read this wrong and thought she hadn‚Äôt walked her dog in 90 years...
Am i the only one that wants an update on Buddy's weight loss?
Sad doggo just wants treats and sleeps
His ears are adorable!
People - even 90-year olds - who overfeed their pets should be bitchslapped. An animal can't get fat if there isn't a human stuffing them. Glad Buddy is feeling better, but even so.
Now off to walk your 90 yo neighbor......probably equally obese
Well done mate, although the 90yr old should have a serious talking to for owning an animal and not looking after it
If she's to old to take care of her dog she shouldn't have a dog... Clearly besides not exercising, a bunch of food is just put down and the dog eats as much as it pleases.
I have a neighbor like that, honestly not sure why the elderly get away with abusing their pets so often. Age is no excuse for stupidity.
Cutest little boi
I‚Äôm the before picture
Dogs are gay
lol so great, but the dog DOES look less happy now lol
wow. what a fat fuck that dog used to be.
Good job buddy!
He doesn‚Äôt look proud.
Thank you for doing this
What a good human
[deleted]
You are awesome. But your neighbour is an asshole and that's animal abuse. If it was me, I would report them. I don't give a crap about their age either. If they're not physically able to take proper care of an animal, then don't have one.
If your neighbour can‚Äôt walk him then she isn‚Äôt fit to have him.
Lol at all the fat shamers here. YOU CAN BE OVERWEIGHT AND STILL BE HEALTHY.
He looked more cute as a fatty tho

that makes me sad for that dog. i know the old lady wants companionship but i can't hep but feel sad at the neglect (not malicious obviously)
This is the first dog pic I've upvoted. I always down vote all these.
Did you also remember to fat shame him and take his weight every day?
Can you walk me next?
Can you be the national dog coach? While fat cats are appreciated fat dogs everywhere go UNNOTICED and need your help. You can have your own show and call it ‚Äúpawgress‚Äù
Your ketogains are amazing as well! You go girl!
Good job, Buddy!  Also, that's definitely grandma carpet.
That's a lot of fucking weight for one day. Where they hell you go?
he looks happier fat, go figure
Fat o bitch
how can people have dogs like this that legit legit looks like rats/gremlins i really dont get it. whats appealing about this. even at a young age they are super ugly
Dog looked happier when he was fat. Everyone is happier when they eat. Doggos just dont give a duck if they're fat.
Um.. why isn't the woman walking her dog?
That dog looks way more miserable in the second pic than in the first one ahaha let the guy be fat and content like damn
You're a good person, fuck that owner
Poor guys life was probably cut in half thanks to the dumb fuck owner.
What a fat fuck. A combination of two things I really hate: Fat people and dogs.

Can he slither with it on? It looks like he would slide out.
Holy Crap!I didn't expect this post to blow up like it did. My sister just learned how to crochet about a month ago and she made me this for Spaghetti. Best gift ever!On behalf of Spaghetti, Thank you so much! And thanks again for the gold! Completely unexpected.Thank you! This made my Christmas!
Aw, Spaghetti is a cute name for a snake!
Spaghettis lookin a little al dente
I like that you named your cat spaghetti
WARM LONG BOYE
 Coziest. Danger noodle. Ever.
Aww! I made my little corny a few hats before. His name is Ekans. :)
My name is relevant.
*Theres a snake in my sweater already**His name's Spaghetti*
Ok... I hate snakes and that's the cutest damn thing I've ever seen. Bonus cute points for naming a snake Spaghetti.
My noodles name is Spaghetti too! She's a girl though, and she doesn't have a sweater
So cute, too bad sweaters don‚Äôt work on snakes ;) üêç
I hate snakes but this is so cute I can‚Äôt believe it.
Science question: Do sweaters keep sneks warm? Since they‚Äôre cold blooded, do they generate enough heat (or any, but they must generate some heat I think...) to be warmed by a sweater?
Lookssss like he apresssssssiatessss the nissssse insssssulation.
Spaghetti‚Äôs stomach muscles might not be able to get traction with his new sweater. So he may be in full ‚ÄúWell, I guess this is my life now,‚Äù mode haha.
If snakes had hair, this is how I imagine it would look like
Dude, she just made the arm part.
i think /r/snakes would appreciate this
Would a sweater work for cold blooded animals? Would it be any warmer?
my nem is snekn wen it‚Äôs cold christmas will comeso ive been toldI luv my mumshe get me gifts da fam does tooour spirits lifts my blood is coldmy heart is notI gets a giftI luvs a lot is made of yarn I crawl inside christmas is nice this I decide
The best time to wear a snake sweater... is all the time!
Normally snakes scare the shit out of me but it's so hard to be afraid of a lil guy named spaghetti with big sparkling eyes wearing a sweater his aunt made himIt's the end of the world. I love this little guy. Give spaghetti a kiss on the head for me.
How did you get it on him?
Idk how you got that on him, I feel like if I tried to put a sweater on my corn snake she wouldn‚Äôt be too happy about it lol.
Who needs spag bol when you have the spag boi?
üö´üëûüêç
I want my name to be spaghetti
Omg
Can he still slither?
What kind of death noodle is that?
Literally a danger noodle with the right name.
You have a meme snek
But where are the arm holes?!
Read that as "Made a sweater from spaghetti" Surprised but not disappointed
I think Lowly Worm had a sweater like that.
background on snake?
I loathe snakes. But I ‚ù§Ô∏èseeing this snek in its sweater.
Was it a total surprise? Did she contact you ahead of time and ask how long Sketti is? Or did she come over with a tape measure and you ask "what are you doing with mah snek?" And she said, "oh nothing..."I have a pretty bad fear of snakes. I'm working on it though. Your sweet baby is awfully cute in that sweater.
Aww. Not aww, but a snake shat on me once while I was holding it. Sprayed bile-looking stuff and bits of bones all over me. Perhaps the sweater can double as a diaper?
There‚Äôs a children‚Äôs book (it‚Äôs very old and maybe out of print) called Crictor. It‚Äôs about a boa constrictor whose owner knits him a sweater to wear just like this! It was one of my favorite books as a little girl and my daughter now loves it too :) Such a cute snake and sweater
Good Snek.
Idk what‚Äôs better...a snake named Spaghetti or a sweater made for a snake ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nah not at all lol. It's more of a tube for him to just park in, it doesn't really effect him all that much, he slithers right out of it when he's bored
Many of my family members were slaughtered by this beast, do not trust snek!
If snakes are cold blooded. Is the sweater actually providing any utility for spaghetti? Isn‚Äôt the whole point of sweaters to trap body heat radiated form a persons own body?
Hey everyone!I wanted to thank you so much for sending Spaghetti some love for Christmas, I can't believe how much this thing blew up. I ended up doing an interview with The Dodo this morning. Completely blew my mind. Thanks again, it's really been a fun ride.Here is a link to the interview if anyone wanted some backstory on Spaghetti and his sweater!https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/pet-corn-snake-gets-christmas-sweater
*You named the snake Spaghetti*  *You named him after spaghetti*  Aww
I don't even like snakes but this is adorable.
What type of snek is this?
How does the snake move without sliding right out of the sweater?
Danger noodle has a danger sock now.
I don‚Äôt know what I love more; the fact that the snake is wearing a sweater or the fact that his name is Spaghetti.
Long ass rice
Turtlesnek
He looks happy.
That is the best name for a snake I ever did hear.
Are snakes able to recognize people?
I just thought about if there is any poisonous snake similar to yours and comes in front of you, how would you know which one is yours?
I wanted a bunny rabbit, I was gonna name it Nathan... that's Latin for 'warm' by the way... Nathan Scott Phillips..
Came here expecting Eminem lyrics. Was moderately dissapointed
You get an upvote just for naming your snake ‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù
Seems like your corn snek evolved into a 'carpet' snek :)
It‚Äôs pronounced Ssssssspaghetti, right?
What kind of snake is spaghetti?
That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Your sister is awesome!
Are pet snakes affectionate or are they just like "You're cool" to their owners?
I hate snakes.Can I hug it?
The real question though... is it a scarf a sweater or a onesie?

whoathe video of this is #9 trending on youtube right now.i don't think i've seen an actual interesting minute-long video from a real-life person on the trending section in like 5 years. it's always filled with late night tv show host garbage, 25 minute vlogs by 30 year olds that are marketed to children, and an occasional rap video.Come with me and be awed by this.
So not a turtleneck?
He just crawls out of it on his own. It's not stuck to him (no arms to hold it on!)
Cute and eleguant
Does it... Is a turtleneck sweater?
Spaghetti is literally the best name for a snake ever. I don‚Äôt like snakes but a snake named spaghetti makes me wish I had a snake and named it spaghetti.
" I enjoy this, human"
I guess he likes to slytherin...i will see myself out.

Upvote for the name spaghetti really!
Why is he so damn straight? I thought snakes, like, slithered...
I am sad that I can't see anymore pics of that cutie (yet, I am split between cuteness and "eeww snakes", more pics would help the cute side in me to win)

For some reason I read this as my sister made a sweater out of spaghetti
Now Spaghetti needs a light layer of cheese.
A sweater won't do anything for a cold blooded animal. The only reason clothes make you warm is because you produce heat and the clothing traps that heat.
His tail is sweaty, scales weak, charms are heavy.There's vomit on his sweater already, his name is spaghetti.
Kevin Durant looks cute in this
Aren't snakes coldblooded?
I'm drunk rn so I'll be that one guy. Snakes don't really 'love' anything. They're next to mindless and only care about food, a place to hide and temperature regulation. They're pretty much neutral to everything else. My rosy boa acts like I'm nothing more than an object it's way.
theres snek in his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti
What a noodle
spaghetti = danger noodle
*On today‚Äôs episode of Does Reddit Like Snakes...*Who knows what the answer will be tomorrow
Spaghetti looks more like a cannelloni now
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.
awww i luv sneks <3

There's sweater on his spaghetti already.
/u/Rancor_Emperor post this in r/snek
Good boy, Spaghetti!
This reminded me of [Lowly Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowly_Worm) from the books of my childhood.  Though for some reason I though Lowly Worm was a snake as a kid I guess.

Can Spaghetti move whilst wearing the adorable sweater? haha
Legit thought you meant for spaghetti noodles. Awesome snake with an even cooler name.
Psssssssghet-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-ti is the sound he would make if he was a Pok√©mon.
Do snakes actually show affection?
Spaghetti is a great name. Almost as good as my friend's python named Trouser.
Baby it‚Äôs cold outsssside
This is exactly what I picture as what happens when someone yells "Ridikkulus" at a snake-shaped boggart
Imagine the phone call between OP and their sister.Sister: *Hey how long is your pet snake?*OP: *uuuhhhh, 28 inches, why?*Sister: *No reason*
Sorry to be 'that guy', but snakes are cold-blooded and thus do not produce their own body heat. Sweaters are made to insulate and keep body heat from escaping through the air. Since snakes do not do this in the first place, the sweater is probably a hopeless cause for reptilian comfort. Actually, the guy would probably be much happier under a warm lamp.But it's the thought that counts, right?
"I knew I could pull off a *turtle*neck."
I‚Äôm going to annoy everyone with this knowledge thank you.
"Oh... wow a sweater. Terrific. Just... What a gift. Thank you. This will keep me warm, you know, because of all that *warm blood* in my fucking body."
Rest in Spaghetti, never forgetti.
I need science! For a Warm blooded animal it would help keep body heat in. Does the sweater do anything for the snake, who doesn't generate body heat?
He's mom's spaghetti. <3
Might be cause I am drunk but I picture you're snake screaming in a vegeta tone," women where is my fuzzy snake suit".
His palms are sweaty
I‚Äôm terrified of snakes, but even I have to say this is totally adorable lol spaghetti. that is a really cute name for a snake.
That is the most perfect name for a snake.
Danger noodle
Am I the only one who thought of a sweater for eating spaghetti?
I Isssss happy and warmsssss
Looks more like a ‚Ññ 13 linguine to me...
DOES HE HAS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT?
Does your sister have any children? I would like to think some kid out there gets to say ‚Äúmom‚Äôs spaghetti‚Äù when talking about the snake.
My mom crochets draft snakes to block the cold coming inside. I'm gonna have to step extra high over that draft snake next time I visit, because I'll remember this picture. I hate snakes, but congratulations on a comfortable-seeming snake who I assume is very nice.
https://imgur.com/a/G4VyW
A bit too inconspicuous. What if someone step on snek?
What a cute little sweater
Can spaghetti move in that sweater?
Oh my God so cute!!!!
On the surface he looks calm and sweaty
I showed my husband the photo after reading the captions to him and his first question is "who is Spaghetti?" And then his second question "who does Spaghetti belong to?" He had no other reaction.  Priorities.
Best. Thing. Ever. Right out of The Far Side.
his name should be spaghetto.
Yo I'm high as fuck am I seeing this shit right now?
r/titlegore
It's so cute!
I am terrified of snakes and will now look forward to the many nightmares I am about to endure! Thank you!
serious question: how do sweaters affect snakes? like, does it keep them warm? or will it cause them to overheat in any way?
Hey what are you knitting there? A sweater for my snake. What does it look like?But seriously would you consider making a video of Spaghetti putting on the sweater?And posting it of course!
Finally... a scaly friend makes it to the front page on this subreddit :~)
Reminds me of a double reed on a bassoon or oboe.
I don't like serpents, but Spags here looks like a good boy.
Ugh! Again with people posting snakes that are kind of adorable. I have a phobia, stop confusing me!
As someone who hates snakes, I can't believe how absolutely adorable this is.
What is that? A turtleneck?
It looks so cute !!!
When your snake rocking a knit like that it ain't a "Spaghetti" it's a "**Swag**hetti"
Fuzzy danger noodle!
Came for the sweater of spaghetti.  Left disappointed.
Spaghetti. Thats fucking awesome
Vacuum your floors once in a while holy moly
Possibly the best name ever for a snake
It's a tube top!
Could she add more rows to make it longer, to cover his tail end? This is adorable üêç
I‚Äôd like to see the video of her putting him in that.
r/sneks gave me a whole new perspective on snakesI use to see them as just creepy, but that sub showed me that they can have the personality of a puppy!
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!
This is why I come to reddit
I love the name
A cute snake with a cute name and a cute sweater? Can I visit your family please? :D
don't thread on me!
I like the sssssssssssssweater.
Danger noodle
That's probably the best name for a snake I've ever heard
Spaghetti needs to be an internet sensation!!!!!
I would do anything for you, Spaghetti
How will you know when he wants to come out and fed up of it?
Omg his name is Spaghetti. I love that‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
More like a boa constricted amirite?
Time to vacuum
hate to break it to you, but unless that sweater has active heating, then the only benefit that snake will see is not losing any heat to the flooring and looking cute AF.
For a second I thought "who the fuck names their snake Spaghetti?", then I looked at his face. Spaghetti looks comfy.
I like that his name is Spaghetti
This may be the only time a snake has been adorable. But instinct is telling me it‚Äôs a trap.
Your name, is The Enforcer.I want my name to be Spaghetti.
Hate to be that guy, but sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals. Sweaters just keep your body heat in, they dont produce heat themselves
[deleted]
What kind of dog *is* that?
The most adorable danger noodle/snek I've ever seen. The sweater/knit tube makes it even cuter.
I think he's fine with winnie the pooh'n it.
Nagini thanks you
Reminds me of a Richard Scarry book.
Are insulating garments helpful for keeping cold-blooded animals warm? Just wondering. Not trying to diminish your sister's thoughtful gift.
no step on snek!
I can‚Äôt decide what‚Äôs better. The fact that his name is Spaghetti or the fact that he has a sweater?
I really wish people would stop putting sweaters and shit on their ectotherms. I mean its cute for a photo op or whatever but don't let it hand out like that, you're going to kill it.

You named your cat spaghetti?
I'd be surprised if you haven't seen this already, but I thought of you immediately when I saw this u/Androze
Mom's Spaghetti.
Here I am, 10,000 comments down, but I wanted you to know that your sweatered snek was mentioned in another post about the size of Amazon shipping boxes. I hope you read this in time because it is not too far down from this post in r/All. Spaghetti now has Internet fame. It doesn't get any better than that for a snek. Edit. Poster is u/Protanope.
How are sneks as pets? I assume this is a very chill and friendly type? Sneks arent domesticated like dogs and cats, so just wondering
r/sneks will love your comfy noodle
What kind if dog is this?
Nyeh heh heh! I approve!
Basically Liz Climo in real life
Who in the right mind calls their snake spaghetti?
Aren‚Äòt clothes useless for cold-blooded animals?
That's not spaghetti that's a snake
Snake in the sweater already, sisters spaghetti
It is very nice and I know that reptiles love heat,  but I am not sure how effective a sweater is on a cold blooded animal that does not produce a large amount of heat.
That's a personal protection scarf.
So pure.*so pure...*
Venom on his sweater already, moms spaghetti.

Looks more like a Spaghetto to me.

This makes me want to get a pet snek!
she loves it

For a snake, doesn't a sweater just become a onesie?
Definitely moms spaghetti... ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget your sweater it‚Äôs cold outside.‚Äù
well she should have made a vacuum, broom, and DUSTPAN
Does a sweater work for a cold blooded critter?
I'm loving the name spaghetti. For the first time ever it kinda makes a snake cute.
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.
Can he crawl with it on?
2nd place of all time in 1 day... jeebus.
Funny name!
What a great fucking name for a snake.
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!
That looks constricting...
How adorable!I've read some comments calling him  "Danger Noodle".Cool name for a band, eh??"Squirmy Sid and the Danger Noodles"Love him!
My dad and I caught a king snake when we were out in the sticks, he let me hold it and slowly my grip behind it's head loosened enough so it could turn around and bite me.  My dad in turn said "well I guess we'll find out if it's actually a king snake or if it's a corral snake won't we" and laughed. Looking back I'm still not sure if he was kidding.
RemindMe! 4 months
if a danger noodle is in a sweater, that's called a snuggle noodle
Happy constricting!
snakes are cold blooded....
How can you tell? Genuinely curious as I don't own a snake.
I feel attached to spaghett...
"I want my name to be Spaghetti." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEIOGlIy3BA
It is ironic that this will not raise his body temperature at all.
To poop on.
Missed opportunity to nickname him "Long John"
OMG that‚Äôs sooo adorable!!!
Not sure how that works considering reptiles are cold blooded, but still pretty neat!
r/deepfakes
1 in infinity this has ever happened and documented God is laughing
is it poisonous and does it bite? How does its bite feel like?
How long is he? He's cute!

This didn't earn u/Rancor_Emperor a top post trophy? Bollocks I say... BOLLOCKS!Fix this, u/spez.
Wouldn't a sweater be pointless since snakes are cold blooded?
Ssssssssssnuggles
Quick question, how do you get it on him?
[removed]
I have to show this to my husband! We have 4 snakes he he!
Turtleneck?! Interesting choice.
Spaghett!
Fuck snakes!
Just wanna say that insulation on cold blooded animals is very unhealthy for them as it interferes with their body‚Äôs ability to absorb heat or cool off.
He's a sleepo beepo
Can someone make me a few of these? I have a 5ft corn snake, 2 3.5ft ball pythons, a 1ft hognose, and a 6ft boa constrictor. I'm in the UK and will happily pay. Also interested in a selection of snake and gecko sized hats.
Never knew snakes can be pets !!! Moment of enlightenment. Are these comparable to Dogs and Cats? Still cannot get my head around. So confused right now. Sorry if I offended you in anyway. From where I come from we have been taught to be scared of them !!!
Putting a sweater on a creature that needs to absorb heat from its environment seems counter productive.
There‚Äôs vomit on his sweater already, name‚Äôs spaghetti.
You guys realize hes cold blooded so its barely gonna warm him right :P
But snakes don't produce their own body heat, so wouldn't this not work?
Think about the animals in these kind of posts, you‚Äôre having a giggle about an animal‚Äôs discomfort.

Spaghetti is the name of my cat, and tater tots was the name of my dog.
He's gonna be a sweaty Spaghetti.

His name's Spaghetti? That's fantastic.
Cozy lil' danger noodle
Is this spaghetti before he‚Äôs been boiled?
But....how can you tell?
He looks dangerous.
Can it move with it on?
I have a corn snake named Spaghetti too! looks just like yours. Merry Christmas!
Danger noodle does a snug
Is it hard caring for a snake?
i doubt snakes are capable of feeling love
hi cutie
Best snake name I‚Äôve ever seen
I need one of these for my bong
That‚Äôs such a cool name lol
But but... snakes don't produce heat do they?
Damn nice sweater there Spaghetti.
/r/snek
Yes but no but ... there are no holes for his arms and legs
This is so weird but so adorable somehow. He's a charmer srsly.
Moms spaghetti
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day
But Spaghetto can‚Äôt move while wearing it without just sliding out, right?
Do you have a hamster named meatball too?
Aren‚Äôt snakes cold blooded? Wouldn‚Äôt this fail to make him warm?
He loves it until he wants to move around
What happens if he tries to move? Does the sweater move with him or does he just slither out of it? It's gotta be the latter right - too much friction between the sweater and the carpet?
This is pure love
Ssssssssssspeghetti
There's a snake inside the sweater already , named spaghetti
Now Spaghetti has macaroni sweater
I love that name
Everything about this is great! :)
What kind of snek is Spaghetti?
Can he slither around still in it or does he just slither right out of it?
Snuggly Snek!
Just wondering, since snakes don‚Äôt generate any endothermic heat, wouldn‚Äôt this actually make a snake colder???
How can one guess the emotions of a snake?

Awesome
This thing is awesome and I need he loved it being cold blooded!

Have you trademarked this?
It's cute just those kinds of blankets don't help keep a cold-blooded animal warm.
How is he gonna crawl now
Spaghetto*
So sweet...
My dogs name is also Spaghetti
How would a sweater keep a cold blooded animal warm?
Would this even make him warmer? Since he‚Äôs cold blooded isn‚Äôt his body temp the same as the ambient temp? So this wouldn‚Äôt make any difference.
Thsts awesome! For some reason I don't mind a snake in a sweater.
Is it your mom's?    ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^so ^^^^sorry.
does clothing really help a cold-blooded animal? Honest question. I am sure they generate some heat, of course, but it enough for the sweater to be effective?
I also could not resist naming one of my spaghettis ‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù. ;)
Quick question: is he able to move around and keep it on or is he only able to sit still? Cute lil noodle by the way :)
I didn't know that I needed to see a snake in a sweater.... But I'm so glad that I got to see Spaghetti in a sweater.
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs better - your snake‚Äôs sweater or his name
Wrap that rascal.
Ok that is hilarious.
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day!! Tell Spaghetti I love him ‚ù§Ô∏è
Maybe an obvious question ... But how does one get  sweater on said snake?
Worst. Fleshlight. Ever!!!
your nope rope is dope.
ohhhh that‚Äôs so cuteeeee
Is that what they call tube snake boogie?
No no no no no...Spaghetti makes me pee a little.
Sup dog?! Front page! Merry Christmas.
Mom's spaghetti
Hah!
I think he might be crying for help.
Mom‚Äôs spaghetti?
Pet snakes huh, think I want one
It's a long bunny rabbit, huh?
It's sssssuper

What happens when he swallows a rabbit?
How can you tell?
I have that same carpet.
I bet a reptile feel very happy living as a pet...
Now there‚Äôs no excuse if you step on snek
I am now aware that snake sweaters are a thing. This is a truly wonderful Christmas. Thank you OP.
For some reason I just cranked up tube snake boogie by ZZ Top
That‚Äôs a weird lookin spaghetti
Too much starch ,,, that is a king cobra about to strike !!
This is why I want a snake.
I could not stop laughing when I saw this.  Rad :)
LMAO
White people crazy af bro
My palms are sweating just looking at this...
I misread the title as "My sister made a sweater out of spaghetti", *Oh this aughta be good* I thought - AWW ITS A LITTLE SNEK
This makes me regret not getting my ten year old daughter the snake she asked for.
MOM'S spaghetti.
Does she use heat lamps in its enclosue if she thinks the house is too cold for it?
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!
Theres vomit on the sweater already. Moms Spaghetti

I was in a bar on a greek island one summer and went up to a girl to try and pick her up. I asked what her name was and she said it was Spaghetti. Im like, no its not. She replies 'fuck you my name is Spaghetti'
That is a danger noodle if I've ever seen one.

There is a book called Crictor about a lady knitting a sweater for a snake, just like this. My mom made my snake one too a few years ago, because of this book!
Read of spaghetti at first.How THAT would look like I wonder...
Adorable!!
Good name!
Do snakes get itchy?
if people start putting knitting on pet cockroaches id probably feel equally weirded out
I know what I'm making for my cornsnek this year.

Will he be able to move after wearing that sweater?

Not so much snek sweater. More like snek overalls.
I'm no biologist, but since an ectothermic animal (e.g a reptile) relies on absorbing heat from its environment to survive, wouldn't that mean insulation like a sweater would actually be much more of a hindrance to them?
How would you possibly get him in there without pissing him off?
Hahah!!! This is great!!

adorable yes, but i wonder.. would a sweater *do* anything for a snake since they are cold blooded.. I thought that meant they didn't generate their own body heat.

How did you get that smol boye into it?? Is it snug?
Is he named Spaghetti after this mother, Mom Spaghetti?
Seeing that makes my palms sweaty.
Only one question. Does he belong to your mom?
I think he wants to molt the fuck out of that.
would this make it harder for spaghetti to move? super cute though :)
Snek appreciates
Cozy snek
in binary, a spaghetto is like there's no snake at all.

Sneks can't keep themselves warm. Put it up your leg for warmth.
I gotta know, how likely are snakes to bite compared to other pets?
I‚Äôm surprised there‚Äôs no vomit on his sweater already.
Did you play him like.. A DAMN FIDDLE? *twitches*
Is spaghetti a kingsnake?  My kingsnake, larry, loved to burrow in things....she would have loved a sweater
Thats suh cute, can he slither around with it on?

I always think I want a snake, but then I remember the costs and maintenance to keep our stringiest reptilian overlords pleased, and I don't think I could do it.
Being a cold blooded creature, a sweater doesn‚Äôt exactly make sense... not trapping any body heat.
That's so cute.
I'm sorry but this just makes me think of aqua teen hunger force.Cool snek btw
Never heard of Spaghetti, who celebrates that?
Looks like a "Sir-pent"
That's just the waaaave
I was hoping for new spaghetti sauce technology woven into a sweater. Mildly disappointed.

What brand of snek is that, if I may ask?
Looks like a mean ass joint brother, tell me you hit that shit after this pic
He looks warm and adorable!
I respect spaghetti.
Probably a dumb question, but can he move while wearing that? I think it'd be so hilarious seeing a snake with a sweater on just slithering around.
Looks just like my door snake
Noodley Tube dude
snek
Would a sweater actually keep him warm though? Reptiles don't generate body heat to be kept in. I suppose if the sweater itself is warm, the proximity would also keep him warm.
wam snek
Uhh... I don't want to stress you out but there's a snake in your spaghetti :(
very cute
Always use protection on your Spaghetti.
Spaghetti is a great name!
HAHAHAHA! This is hilarious!

Gotta stay warm :)

I never thought in my life that I‚Äôd ever upvote something with a snek on account of my phobia but darned if this isn‚Äôt precious. And the name Spaghetti is fantastic.
Is that your mom's snake?...
Reptiles are cold blooded.
Pretty sure sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals.Just saying... it kinda has the opposite effect right?
That is so cute. Never thought that such things can actually happen.
Snakes make my knees week, and my arms are heavy.
Spaghetti mentioned on Reddit and almost 2000 comments later barely a lyric from Lose Yourself. That must be one adorable snake!
I am always curious how people deal with large snake pets. What do you feed it every day? How do you deal with its poop? Unlike dogs and cats, they do not poop outside or in a specific place, right?
Awesome!
At what point does a snake decide you are not a meal?
NOPE
Other than being cute, would this actually do anything? Technically being cold blooded wouldn't this have a cooling effect rather than warming?
I wanna be called Spaghetti
So this is what spaghetti looks like huh...
Make sure not to get vomit on the sweater and does spaghetti belong to your mom? ;)
Lowly worm IRL.
Ectotherm turns endotherm!

I thought this was r/Crochet
But where does he place his legs?
What kind of snake is he?  I've wanted to get a snake for my son, is this a good snake for amateurs like us?
I'm sure it seems obvious but please do not put it on him for extended periods. That could cause some serious thermoregulation issues.
Spaghett**i** is plural though, the proper name for him would be Spaghett**o**
This is a cruel representation of the life of a cold blooded individual just trying to get some snizz
That‚Äôs just silly
I just want to know what type of snake this is? Corn snake?
Thisss issss nicessss - snek probably
I believe spaghetti isn‚Äôt a singular, so it should be ‚ÄúMy sister made a sweater for Spaghetto‚Äù
Thats not spaghetti, thats a snake.
Jackets keep us warm by helping us trap in our own heat. I wonder if this sweater helps a cold blooded snake keep warm. Anyone know?
I love it but... You know how a doctor tests the sensitivity of skin with one of two sharp points? Can a snake feel two points if both hit the same scale? Fuzzy may mean nothing to them. And since they don't make their own heat insulation may have little meaning.
so really very cute >,.<
Genuine question here( I don't know anything about snakes) - is this close contact with wool bad for Spagetti's skin?Cool foto OP, really an awww momentWaiting on your sister to knit a sweater for your pet Rancor too, OP!
I thought snakes didn't sweat.
Honestly the best thing about this post is that you named your snake ‚Äúspaghetti‚Äù
Since reptiles are cold-blooded (they don't produce a steady body heat), does a sweater work to keep them warm?
You made my wife squee. Good job!
Wao looks so comfortable

She totally deserves it !!
I've never thought of snakes as adorable before. Cool, maybe, but this is a first for me. Awwwwwww :)Also, that name is a hilarious choice. 1000 points to whoever thought that up.
Love the sweater, but upvote goes for calling him/her "Spagetti"
That name is so cute

I‚Äôve always wondered, do pet snakes feel/show love? Or do they just kinda chill there and not care about anything?
Hey uh... You have cat's don't you? ü§î
Is he trained to not bite you?
Is it for real?
How‚Äôd you get him in there?
He crawls inside of it and just sits there. after awhile he works his way out. Its more of a cozy sleeping bag if you want to look at it that way. Its the principal!
You think?? With a snake, can one ever be sure.
wow.. just awesome
Now snek is warm blooded :)
Probably already said but snakes are cold blooded, so would this do anything?
Wowüòç cutieeee
What an adorable danger noodle
Must get cold feet
It suits him down to the ground.
My nan used to have a draft excluder just like that
Now that's hot.
Does it bite?Is it poisonous?Do people who have pet snakes get their poisons removed? (In India snake charmers do this)
World is bizarre!
How could you name a snake Spaghetti?? Weird people
But how did you spa-get-hi him in it
Is he many?
Nice snek you got there.
It warms him!
People are saying that it won't do anything for him because he's cold blooded. If he's warmed up to warmer than room temperature from being under a light or something it'll keep him warmer for longer.
i named my tarantula spaghetti too :o!!
Happy snek.
Perfect name. Perfect sweater.
No he doesnt
I think he hates it.
He is the cutest dangernoodle :D
I am terrified of snakes and normally can‚Äôt even look at pictures of them. But this is adorable!
How can I not upvotes a snake named Spaghetti?
He looks exactly like the stuffed tubes you use to block draught into your house! Haha

Oh my god..
Don't shiver spaghetti! Put on your sweaty!

Posing a cold blooded creature for upvotes is disgusting! Snakes are not warmed by sweaters!
So if snakes are cold blooded wouldn't the sweater not warm up unless the heat is from a different source?
Has anyone pointed out since snakes are cold blooded they don‚Äôt give off body heat and a sweater would do nothing? Or am I misunderstanding cold blooded
Hard to say really.
His Name's Spaghetti No knees, cold blood staringA Crochet sweater hes wearingHis owner's caring on purpose
#nasty.
Lol ur dog is fuckin spahget
As a cold-blooded animal that doesn't generate its own heat. Wrapping it in an insulating blanket shouldn't do anything for it at all.
She should've called him Spaghett(O)! Cause Spaghett(I) is plural :/
One string of spaghetti is called a 'spaghetto'. Soo.. You should rename him.
Kill it with fire
More pictures are acceptable.

The look on his face is cold blooded.
Not to knock the fun out of it but wouldn‚Äôt this be really bad for the snake? They don‚Äôt generate their own heat and now he can no longer absorb heat from his environment as readily. A sweater for a snake is cute, but shitty.
There's vomit on his sister already....sweater spaghetti
Fuck that snake.
I thought it was danger noodle
Obligatory link to r/Sneks
It just holds in the cold from his cold blood
Unfortunately snakes are cold blooded, so while he may look cute in a sweater, it isn't going to do him much good.  I'm sure he'd much rather wrap himself around your neck for warmth.
Or he absolutely despises it...hard to tell with reptiles.
Mom's spaghetti.
is that kevin durant?
It almost looks more like a snake straight jacket. He looks trapped!
how dare you to asume its gender?

Virginia my home sweet home I want to give you a kiss
I could use a sweater like that for myself
Just like humans love Straitjackets.
He probably fucking hates it. Why do you think he loves it? He's a fucking snake. How the fuck is he supposed to move around in that?
Thinking a snake can derive warmth from a "sweater" is foolish and dangerous, enjoy your meaningless upvotes.
[removed]
snakes  as pets are stupid
I just never understand how people can like a pet snake.. their eyes are lifeless..
Since snakes are cold blooded, won't that keep him from getting warmth?
That's cute but because snakes are cold-blooded, rather pointless.
Although it‚Äôs a super cute idea, reptiles do not have body heat, so you‚Äôd basically just be trapping the cold in and they would just get colder and maybe die.. unless you have them enclosed with heat, even then, you‚Äôd be trapping more heat than needed and they might not live after so long. But a cute idea!
Do you fucks kick dogs? Google cold blooded animals, op is an attention seeking whore!
A vacuum cleaner would've been nice too i guess.

Lol after the jump the cat was like ‚Äúwtf is going on lemme check if the table just vanished‚Äù then **tapping intensified** and ‚ÄúDAMMIT I KNEW IT‚Äù
The cat version of the classic [dog who thinks the glass door is closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2hmwn7/dog_stays_outside_because_he_thinks_the_terrace/).
"What happened to the magical force  field that used to be here?"
Fuck yes, this gif was worth 187 MB on a 2M connection
At the end he's touching it like "what the fuck is this witchcraft?"
180mb gif? Really?
We did this once to our glass table but instead of jumping on the table, he ran full force into the glass that was leaning up against the wall.  The "Thunk" he made was incredible.
Logitech Z5500?
Still graceful AF
It almost looks like she had a sense of humor about it. This is really cute.Edit: She, not he.
I was incredibly confused by this at first...I have almost an identical desk, with an almost identical sub in the corner, with the same weight under the right side, with similar carpet under, and used to have that same keyboard.  If it wasn't for the wall color (which I really, really like by the way) and the cat (also adorable--I have two, but thankfully they aren't doppelgangers as well) I would have thought that I was looking at my own downstairs.
I have this desk!!! The glass is so scratched and ugly after 3 years. I windex and windex and all I can think of are all the scratches. My cats fear it
I wish I had a cat.I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.:(
I'd love to know what they're thinking...
It really amuses me to think that many animals must think they're levitating when they lay on glass. To them, the world is full of invisible walls that can disappear and reappear at any time.
"ah, yes. Everything is ok.  I meant to do this." *rubs*

Cats are strange and amazing creatures. One of mine is obsessed with the fish tank so much so I count the fish every morning make sure she didn't get one lol. Several times a day she will do a paw check just to make sure the glass is still there, because hey, who knows? Water might be holding itself in place this time.
This should be on r/nonononoyes
I did not expect it to jump up! That was awesome.
I have the same desk.

I wish I recovered like that
your cat made my day bearable, thank u
/r/youseeingthisshit
What you don't realize is the cat knew that the glass was gone.  The cat was simply testing you to see if you understood its perception of reality.  Cats are always right.  Just realize, now, that when you put the glass top back on, the cat will jump *through* the glass.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?
Hey what‚Äôs going on here?
She can be silly sometimes.
I‚Äôd score that dive a perfect 10.
I know y'all rich fuckers with 100MB/s, but could we have gifs that do not weigh 187MB pls?
Cat handled that jump like a fucking champion. That's a magical creature right there.

Yo, I have that same desk. I love that desk. I did very similar thing cleaning it when I went to set down a smoothie , and it went right through.

16.83  There's your trouble, homan person, the part that goes here is missing.
cat goes straight to smelling as if that's going to identify the problem lol
I feel like you can see a part of the cat's brain going HANG ON SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT before the jump but not managing to convince the rest of it to stop.
It's kinda frustrating that I'll never be able to convey to that cat what's happening and it'll never know
This cat is the Richard Feynman of cats, using her paw to create a model of the natural world for future reference (the no table where there is clear was a table not now theory of tables) and predictions. Of course scent marking the "phenomenon" with the side of her face and whiskers in case formal model fails at some point in the future.
At least it was a 10/10 jump.
You know how when you're going down the stairs and you think there's one less step than there is and for a split second you think "this is how I die"? Times that by a hundred and I bet that's what that cat just went through.
I once spilled drinking water over my bed I had to take the mattress outside for drying.Came back to find my cat staring at an empty bed frame with devastating look, like it‚Äôs the end of the world for her.
"What sourcery is this???"

Cat.exe malfunctioning
I needed this laugh.
More important is the update when you put glass back on. Will he or wont he have the same level of confidence?
Dude! I have the same desk and my cat also almost looks like yours!!!
This has made my day. Thank you.
Haha this reminded me of my dog but much less graceful. My dog just kinda flopped over and it took him 4 tries before he realized something was wrong.
/r/BetterEveryLoop
Just watched this on a continuous loop, he jumps so perfectly into the table.
Lol...that is too funny. Poor baby..
Oh my. I just about peed my pants from laughing so hysterically. But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed with guilt for laughing at the poor helpless and confused feline! The wife and I always talk about our West Highland Terrier being a creature of habit. Well, I think the same applies here. Thanks for the video. I pray the cat recovers soon.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt touch the table! I went right though it! Am I a ghost?!‚Äù
Another Z-5500 in the wild! Best audio purchase of my life until I finally upgraded to a large system.
**BOOING!** -- *Oh. what...*
At least it was a graceful leap
''My whole life was a lie.''- Cat
That's a good lookin desk ya got there. Looks just like the one I bought not too long ago lol
No no no, you see... I totally did this on purpose!
I have the same desk works well, lmao your cat, classic.
I'm going to go home and try this on my kitten, thank you for brightening up a long day.
Does anyone know what breed this is? My older cat passed away had this exact fur pattern and everything. Would love to look up pics of the breed.
Marvelous.  Did not stop its curiosity.  Delightful cat.
I have the same desk, but not the same cat.
Will someone that knows how to edit video please show us what it would look like if the cat passed through the magical desk plane and came out on the other end as something else?
"Oh no, I'm a ghost!"
Cat acts all casual... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing hurdles‚Äù.
Seriously love watching animals figure stuff out.
Nice party/circus trick
Kudos to you for keeping your desk so clean that the cat couldn't tell the glass was gone.
Hahaha
Bless it.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
‚ÄúRemoved the glass huh? Fuck it I‚Äôll just fuck up this suction cup!‚Äù
I have that same desk! Put a LED strip around the upper black frame and it looks pretty cool.
Heh... I have that desk. I absolutely hate it.
Damn. I guess we vastly overestimate their intelligence. Lovely.
lol..... he acts all casual like he planned it that way............
I have this desk! It sucks!
I have that same desk, and carpet... and wall color with white trimming. My brain glitched for a second
Hey I have the same desk. Time to fuck with my cat!
I like how he played it off..lol
this made me legit LOL
Note to op: When cleaning top of desk, turn desk into ring of fire for cat to jump in
To show solidarity with the cat, place coffee cup on the invisible tableü§îüôÇ
such a fucking idiot
Hey, what happened to the force field that's usually here?
Nailed that jump though
Stuck the Landing thoi !
Ah, is that a z5500 sub I spot there?I have two sets. Probably gonna sell one. Bought it from a guy used for $140 lol. Practically a steal if you ask me. I was running two subs using a cable I got from eBay. You learn to appreciate just how powerful that sub is after running two in unison and being overwhelmed lol.
#Cat logic:*maybe if I paw at, or rub my body on it, it'll go back to normal*
I have the same desk!!Edit: did your desk come with a cat? Mine didn't =(
Wow this looks exactly like my cat of 16 years who passed away last March. Miss ya Flip...
I wish I recovered like that

I love how his paws were prepared for landing but nothing was there üòÇ
I miss my cats :-(
All things considered that landing was graceful as fuck.
179 mb gif??!
Your cat probably thinks it has super powers now and will try to run through a wall.
Can you imagine the thoughts going through that cat's mind, thinking it would land on a table but instead "Oh shit! What! Where's the-"
At least your cat is still curious, some cats won't do anything but sleep.
This is awesome - I love watching children and animals as they try to make sense of their world! Gives one a new perspective on the workings of the brain. üòä

This cat is intelligentlly stupid.
WOOSH
r/animalsbeingderps ?
I have that same exact desk lol, some of the suction cups have lost their suction over the years though
I am guessing your cat is the reason you are cleaning it in the first place? Paw prints EVERYWHERE.
Swish!
I have that exact same desk it‚Äôs pretty awesome!
I have the same desk. You have either prevented or caused many hours of cat confusion.
I just like how the cat checks it again with it's paw like "whaaa it was juuust here, I could've sworn..."
i would have been shook too
I had that exact same desk as my first desk, the first delivery had the short and the triangle pieces broken, the second attempt the triangle piece was see through and not black and it took like, 3 weeks for the final delivery with the black corner. Then I got disgustingly drunk one day and broke it :(
I have the exact same desk. Now all I need is the exact same cat.
gfycat in the title confused me for a moment.
Human your invisible forcefield is broken
I have that same exact desk it was like 50$ at walmart 10 years ago. I lost the suction cup thingies though.
I think it's a requirement that everyone once in their life has to own this desk.  I had the silver one.  I think it was ~$100 on Amazon.
I have that same desk.
Hey, that didn't work...  let me try it one more time...
Used to have that same desk. It‚Äôs always weird to me that other people have the same furniture as me in their houses.
That is so great.  "Wtf, Kevin?!!!"
I have that exact same desk!
'telle hooman, what magic is this?'
I have the same desk!
My cat did the same thing with our coffee table.  It's a wooden frame with glass panel insets.  We removed the glass for cleaning and Marco jumped onto it like he normally does and ended up doing a front flip through it, poor guy.
Now I want to take the glass out of my coffee table.
Boing! ‚ÄúWait. How‚Äôd I get back down here?‚Äù
r/catpranks material
Basically cats just trust that the glass is there, probably some black magic to them.

I have that same exact desk.
My shitty day is a thousand times better. Thank you, OP!!!
haha what a fuckin idiot
 Cats are known for their champion landings.
Mmmmmmm... still got your Logitech Z-5500. Love that sound system.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?
Haha I used to have the identical desk! Sold it when I had to move to another place. I needed to clean those glasses almost once every four or five days, otherwise it becomes unbearably dirty.You have a cute cat!
"Maybe if I hit it with my paw it will come back"
Science plays a part here. I'm not sure how, but I am certain it does.
Youre a wizard harry
That was a great jump.
You monster
That's is SO funny
Is this the matrix they are always talking about
Your cat looks exactly like my cat, Twix.
I'd like to see the reaction after you put the glass back on
Cat.exe has stopped
He is confused kkkk
Are... Are you me? I have a desk, speakers, keyboard, and a tabby that all look very identical to yours.
oh nooo :(
Hey I had that desk!
Dude we have the same desk! The beat deska come from the Amazon!
I‚Äôd like to see him try that when you put it back on...
The form on that feline. Absolute unit
Hey I have that exact desk!
How many jumps onto the "desk" did it take for your cat to figure this out?
I'm in a library, i cant laughing out loud like this....
Meanwhile, a human expects one last 4 inch step that isn't there and dislocates hip.
I have the same desk! I ripped off the shelf thing and left one arm on for my headphones to hang off of lol

I have that same desk!! Also cute cat!
"Where's the edge on this thing? Ok i KNOW i nailed that. what in the fuck?"
I have almost the same desk, and the same Logitech Z5500 subwoofer beneath it.  I hope I can get my cat to perform this stunt as well, that was fantastic.
I love this haha
Cat taps the desk and says what is this sorcery??
My long lost Desk sibiling!
Had the same desk in my old apt
That cats going to piss on something tonight I guarantee it
I have that same desk lol
I have an almost identical desk. Bought from IKEA 28 years ago.
Yep.. Right here... This is basically why I Reddit - I could watch this on a continuous loop for hours.  Cats are the best
I must have watched this over a dozen times, every time just as impressed.
Must have jumped to far and missed the table, let me confirm if the glass top is still there.
‚ÄúCareful, human. All is not as it seems.‚Äù
I used to have this same desk. I got it from Jysk. I actually kind of hated it so I sold it.
 I have that same desk! Shelves built in on the right side? Great for gaming
He played it off like he meant to do that.
r/StoppedWorking
something's awry in the Kingdom
Instead of a desk, my dad had a fish tank that his cat liked to jump on. One day, he took off the cover to clean it. His cat jumped in the tank.
I think all of you are missing what this cat is doing... He's clearly an opportunist, using the bar to perfect his his high jump.
I see we have the same desk! Does it also drive you fucking Bananas when you try and get close and hit your chair wheels on the center legs?
I have that same desk, I think it was a target original
Cat just confirming suspicions.
Yo I have the same desk, 10/10 would recommend
It‚Äôs crazy how a cat can judge the height of something, and then launch itself to a perfect landing. Not too high, not too short. But just right to ensure a soft landing.
This post is going places.
https://goo.gl/images/tRPuhT
10/10, graceful landing
Whats going to be funnier is when he accepts the glass is not there and slams right into it when you put it back
I ~~could~~ would watch this forever
Eqqq
I have that desk!
"yeah I totally meant to do that."
Does this qualify for r/animalsbeingderps? Absolutely hilarious!
I have this exact desk, now I feel like I need to clean it.
Yeah, I've never cleaned the glass.
LMAOWhen he jumped through the desk I completely lost it
i have that same desk.
You have pretty feet for a *dude*
I hate that desk, I have the same one, just without the glass now. Was stripping a wire and the wire strippers slipped, hitting the edge of the glass, shattering it in a billion pieces. Glass. Everywhere. Took an entire day to clean it all and I still find pieces of glass under things to this day.
Ha ha ha ha my husband has the same desk. I‚Äôll have to try it with my kitty Chef.
Dude! I have the same desk!

It's truly amazing how both intelligent, and how stupid this behavior is.
My cat wouldn't fall for that old trick.
You must have had a really clean desk for your cat to fall for this. (I don‚Äôt dust as often as I should)
I had this exact desk though mine grey...solid corner desks
r/hangers
No the kitty understands. He is just taking this opportunity to practice high jump
I find amazing that kitteh is using his whiskers pointed outward to make sure he doesn't boop the glass with his nose.
Had the same desk. Black glass looks soooooo nice. But a dust gatherer.
Damn this looks like my exact setup when I was a kid, had the same desk and same sub (in the same spot) and keyboard and everything.Same kind of cat too! WTF
There are some things on Reddit that I just can't help but chuckle out loud at while at work

r/StoppedWorking maybe?
So years ago I had a chinchilla called Perry. He was fucking adorable, he was like my best fuzzy little friend. He liked to sit either with or on us.He got so used to jumping on the foot stool we had that one night when my mum moved it he kept jumping up and trying to land on it even when it clearly wasn‚Äôt there, and he was so confused and determined that if he just jumped one more time he‚Äôd land on it as always. It‚Äôs one of the funniest and most adorable things I‚Äôve ever seen an animal do, and this reminds me of that. Animals rock
OMG, at 0:17, that's the first time I've ever seen a cat actively use its whiskers to feel for something it can't see before confirming with a paw.
‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the invisible platform‚Äù
Alley-oop!.. Wait wait whoa whoa whoa...oh okay
‚ÄúHeh, I totally knew there wasn‚Äôt anything there. I just did it for fun just cus. Hey this is a nice subwoofer what is it?
I was having a tough day until I saw this. Thank you kind stranger for making my day better.
I have exactly the same desk LOL but never had the top off for my cat to miss!

Can you imagine being able to casually jump up to 3 times your height
Random question but what's supporting that quarter circle piece? Looked connected on one side and not the other with no leg support. Yup I'm bored.
Same desk :D
Somethins fucky boys
I love it, that could've gone so poorly but it didn't
I had that desk. You don‚Äôt remove the glass for cleaning. Removing entire fingernails is less painful than the assembly of that desk.
Is it because he‚Äôs dum or he can‚Äôt see glass ?
LMAO awesome!
Classic corner glass desk, got one myself.  My cat just decides to knock all my shit off it lol.
This is the first post to make me genuinely laugh for a long time !
Is that a g105 keyboard?
You obviously did not consult the proper authority before starting your cleaning job.
Stoopid cat
 Ay nice, I have a black glass and a solid version of that desk set up; super affordable and useful!
I‚Äôm assuming it is a glass top?
That looked like a terrifying moment
I once took a large poster off my wall due to construction outside shaking the walls so bad I thought it was going to vibrate the frame off the wall...my cat freaked out when she realized it wasn't there any longer, cats are weird.
Have the same desk and I hate it. Can‚Äôt stretch your legs out properly because of the bar under there

200MB for 20 seconds? Is this a joke, OP?
I don't understand why most animals have trouble seeing glass. Is there some kind of abstraction required that most animals are not capable off? Glass isn't really invisible. So something has to be fucking with animal brains to have them act silly.
Dude I have that same desk!!
I have that desk lol
I guess birds aren't the only ones who don't understand glass. lol
I have that desk. And a cat. Hmm.
My parents used to have a glass topped coffee table that I loved to climb on. Well, as I was getting bigger, my mom was worried I would break the glass and get all cut up. So they took the glass off. I then proceeded to climb up, business as usual, and fall straight off the edge like a lemming. My dad can't tell the story without dying laughing. That cat is my spirit animal.
I have that same desk. I have had it for 7+ years and it is still going strong.

How many times did he try to jump on the table?
‚ÄúHooman, what have you here?‚Äù

I love when his feets line up perfectly with where the table is supposed to be
Either that or he understood it perfectly
No bueno, Don. No bueno. What's next? Shrooms and David Lynch films? You, blackmagicfuckery bafoon.
My dogs do something simlar with our beds.We use the metal foundations instead of box springs. So when we have mattresses off to clean & just the slip pad on metal frame. The dogs jump on it thinking its solid, then learn its not lmao

lol that cat's never gonna trust that table again even after you put the glass back on. It will probably screw his mind if you put him on it like "what kind of sorcery is this hooman?!"
Lol when he tries to find glass with his paw
That feline must have thought it would make quite the landing.
Pause it when the cat reaches the invisible glass and you realise how accurate their jumps are, all four paws are on the "glass" flat.
You know what I don‚Äôt understand? Why we still have these giant, long, slow, GIF‚Äôs. It‚Äôs like sending a fax in 2018.

Our cats are twins. It's like watching a video of my cat
10/10 outstanding high jump
Just magic!
Poor kitty keeps going to the human and looks up like, "Would someone PLEASE explain this to me? I'm getting not a little freaked out!" Or, "OK, whose been screwing with my stuff?" For those who aren't cat fans, (I can't believe there would be such a person) cats think EVERYTHING is is theirs. All they have to do is rub the sides of their faces on an object- or human- and BOOM it's theirs!

Cats are surprisingly smart, they don't quite understand whats going on but they acknowledge when things happen and something is different. I fill up bottles with water and my cat knows water comes out the tap so he goes looking for it and down the sink but doesn't quite understand what it is im doing.

I have a glass top dining room table where the cats eat their meals (only place safe from the dogs), and this video is giving me ideas
This feels like the equivalent of walking down the stairs at night and not realizing there's one more step
Sneaky human.
This desk is the absolute worst...I had the exact same one and it was a huge pain.Pro tip guys: **NEVER EVER buy a glass desk....**
I used to have that same kind of table! Have not seen anyone with it before hahaha.
I like the carpet in this gif, what kind is it?
Wow.  5 hours and 102k upvotes. Well deserved
Man, glass tables are acting weird tonight.
Me trying to score
I have this desk. I don't think you put it together correctly though. Those legs would stub your toes. It was a total bitch to put together.
So very funny. Love the little jump and the checking to see if it was really there.
I have the exact same desk, got it from Best Buy.
Preparing for the olimpics.
It's not that he didn't understand. He doesn't seem shocked that there was no glass at all. He is exploring something he thinks is strange.
Just wait how tripped out he will be when you put it back!
Lol. I have glass desk also and my cat does the same thing when I take the glass off. She also tends to walk and roll off the edge thinking the desk continues. It's a great laugh everytime.
Swish
Good desk choice. I bought two for a U formation in my home office.
Whoa I got the same desk lol
Haha that's awesome
cat-astrophic failure
Oh my gosh....I had that desk....I had that keyboard....I had that speaker....Did you get my stuff from my ex?
You know what's coming already, but that is still so hilarious.

Dude, he *totally* meant to do that!
Persistent and smart lol how he checked to see what was going on by the end of it lol
Seriously a great fuckin desk. I've bought it twice over. 2 day shipping available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Three-Piece-Glass-Desk-Black/dp/B075X41RLD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1528767406&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=Glass+computer+Desk&psc=1)
My husband and I had this exact computer desk years ago. Cute kitty!
Are we sure OP didn‚Äôt train the cat to jump through hoops (in the form of a table frame) for reddit karma?  üòÇ
Nailed the landing.  10/10
Now it‚Äôs an agility set.  It has two purposes
I like how the cat checks three times before jumping and then with one final nod of confidence, does the deed.
I have that desk
I have that same desk.... Nice pick OP!
Hey! You have the same shitty carpet I do!'tsup carpet twin!
I laugh every single time I watch this
I have the same desk and hate it.
I have that exact same desk, it was a gift from my parents. They didn't know however that it was not long on one side and short on the other side and is in fact a corner with two equal lengths coming off. This is only an issue because now half of my mothertrucking godflipping futhermucking closet door is blocked and I can't get into the clucker
I wish I could have a cat like that. It will become my dear friend. This cat is really intelligent.Love
I‚Äôve had that same exact desk for years, in multiple states, and it‚Äôs been one of the best investments (even though it was relatively cheap) that I‚Äôve ever made.
I used to have exactly that desk! Crazy!

I have the same desk.
Lol my husband has this desk. Such a bitch to move :p
Cat: 'your trying to say... this ISN'T glass?? o.o'
I have that same exact desk and my cats did the same thing when I removed the glass top to clean it.
Have that desk.Also, have that cat (almost).
Our old cat, Rambo, looked exactly like that... And my dad's desk was that same one. I had to do a double take and make sure someone didn't for some reason steal his video.Different carpet though. You are safe.
I have the same desk
Haha I have the exact same desk and speaker system. The old Logitech 5.1 system was amazing for how much it cost me back in the day. My cat.exe also stopped when I took the desk apart for cleaning lol
Sorry for the old meme buuuut...SAAAIL
Bro..... I recognize that carpet....... do you currently live in Guelph and by perchance know a very tall dude named Derek?
I like how he tried to play it off at the end, like it didn't happen.
So i have the same desk and one of my cats did the exact opposite.She headbutted the bottom of the desk so hard and now she doesnt jump up there any more ):
He is our cats twin....looks and personality.
I have that same desk!!!!

Cheap geeks most popular desk by far. I still have mine. 5 years running. I don't keep my desktop on it though.. The heaviest thing is my monitor. And it's on the edge.
Same desk now I want a cat lol
And still so graceful!
Bless it
Now just set that desk on fire and you got yourself a money maker
Do you like this desk? Can't decide between this or Ikea custom build
Poor cat!!üòÅ
Hey I have that desk! And I used to have that keyboard, but I don't have a cat. What does it all mean?
i'm dead
u/conspicuous_nobleman
Just remove the bottom to clean next time. Then the cat can still jump on.
I used to have that exact same desk! It was amazing.
It went on cheking again just to be sure if it is removed or i just got teleported..üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I have that same desk! Got it at Ikea like 25 years ago
He just keeps jumping through it.
What a foolish creature, man!
That beast of a Logitech subwoofer as well. Still got mine.
*I totally meant to do that, dude*
But... Does that mean that he doesn't see the glass when it's there?
And the cat still landed on her feet.
"The magic surface is gone..."
same desk!

I have the same desk! I planned on cleaning it the same as this in the next few days.
I have the same desk with the black tempered glass! Love it
I think I have the exact same desk
On a side note. That carpet is purrrfect for class sharpening.

Inb4 this gif makes it into a doctorate in domestic cat behavior and familiar surroundings. Hi mom
You are not going to be laughing when the cat knocks over the plates of glass
Came for the cat, stayed for the toes. Great foot m8.
Why were you recording? Did you know she was going to do that? If so, that's fucking animal abuse. She could have gotten seriously hurt. You are seriously messed up.
Repost
I miss my Grandma.
Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN
This made me so emotional.
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.
She still has the childlike wonder.
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.
That‚Äôs all it takes. Minimal effort. It takes minimal effort to be kind and nice to people. Remember that next time you‚Äôre out and about.
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!
Selfish question: the woman in this video reminds me so much of my ex-girlfriends mother. We‚Äôve been broken up for nearly 2 years‚Äî but I‚Äôve never forgotten the love and support her mother gave me. Absolutely wonderful woman‚Äî but no desire to get back together with her daughter. Would it be a weird move to send my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs mother a letter, just thanking her for everything she did for me? I feel guilty I never properly expressed my gratitude at the time‚Äî but don‚Äôt want her to be weirded out by some random card from her daughters old boyfriend.
This lady looks like she would bake the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.
And you just know they wouldn‚Äôt have bothered if she wasn‚Äôt someone that they really liked. Someone that really deserved a sweet surprise.
Waitresses never kiss me on the cheek.
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.
Props to the waitress, what a genuinely warm hug and peck on the cheek, bless her heart too. Back when my dad was still living, and in an assisted living facility, I would see him and his elderly floor mates very often.Nothing made them light up more than a young person spending time with them, the younger the better.And if you brought a baby, we‚Äôll forget about it, plan on spending the whole day because you will see the sheer joy that a baby will bring to this generation that raised a lot of us.If you‚Äôre a teenager reading OP‚Äôs post with a smile. Say hello to someone this darling woman‚Äôs age, help them with their groceries, or pay for their coffee. More often than not, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Your heart will swell like the Grinch‚Äôs when he clapped eyes on little CindyLoo Who.Here‚Äôs hoping this woman has many more birthdays and each are filled with this much joy, if not more.
Can all things on the internet be things like this please
Looks like they dropped a heavy gift bag on her too.
When we get older, we don't put as much value on our birthdays. It's easy to just let them pass by with minimal fuss when we're adults. But something like this, this little reminder that it is an important day, especially to just a casual acquaintance, is incredibly nice and meaningful.
Oh my god she seems like an absolute sweetheart, she's the sorta customer I miss from working customer service.
This is so precious, and her husband is wearing a checkered shirt too!She seems a really, really lovely person. :)
That makes me cry. That's more than I got on my birthday. It's nice to be noticed and feel wanted.
I want to just give her a squeeze! Her face is just pure joy and appreciation.
This looks irish
The amount of feels I‚Äôm having right now...
I am a cold, bitter, broken old man and even I liked this one.
I LOVE THIS!!!!
These are the types of people that make working at a restaurant totally worth it! Happy birthday to this sweet soul who is obviously so deeply cared for!
She‚Äôs perfect for the old guy from UP
Just got off the phone with my mom wishing her a happy birthday. After seeing this I would have given a lot to do this same thing for my mom
Can we talk about how they match?
What a beautiful moment!
This brings tears to my eyes. My grandmother and I had a diner we would get breakfast at almost everyday. Once she became weaker we went less and less. Everyone at the restaurant knew us by name and had our order in before we even sat down, we truly felt like family. She would write personal cards and get gifts for every staff member on their birthdays and holidays. Everyone loved her and would come out of the kitchen to give hugs and kisses. She passed away a year ago. This brings me so many good memories about her thank you.
You‚Äôre going to make me cry.
Wow really nice!  Small gesture but it goes so far!
Man I wish there was a subreddit for happy old people
I work in a hospital ER and the other day and one of our patients came in on his 97th birthday. He had no nobody with him.The catering service sent up a little chocolate cake and all the nurses came into his room and sung him happy birthday. He was so happy he was crying.
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady‚Äôs day.
/r/eyebleach
AwwwHappy birthday!
u/commonvanilla Do you know this woman? She looks very much like my mother and has very similar mannerisms.
Oh my god she‚Äôs so cute! 10/10, would hug
I need a hug like that rn.
The way she looked at them after she gave her a hug and put her face in her hands was so endearing. Props to that staff!
I fucking love how appreciative people are. This is some good shit, fuck yea it‚Äôs good to see this
What gentle soul! A ball of positive energy, an most of all, a destroyer of cakes and baked goods
Can I hug her?
so precious
Awwwww the rest of the world, listen up. Be this. Please. I hate not having this everywhere. We would all live in heaven just for a little bit if we could do this
Brb melting
I bet she makes amazing cookies
Sure, the granny is adorable. But she looks like a Grade-A certified Badass with her collar popped like that. Like she could go full John Wick on you if your not careful
OP here after a sound night‚Äôs sleep (no school, no sleep deprivation tonight). I can‚Äôt believe what a beautiful response this has gotten. This video I brightened my entire weekend after a stressful week and I‚Äôm overjoyed to see so many people liking it too. Reading through all the nice comments directed to this video and to the other commenters...it‚Äôs such a change from normal reddit.For some who have asked, no it isn‚Äôt me. This is a video I found off Instagram that was too beautiful not to share.
That is a woman that does not get appreciated enough in her daily life.
This makes me want to hug my mom.
People like this made waiting tables almost worth it.
Tickled pink!
Meanwhile in other threads little spoiled shits are like "ugh! I can't believe someone would do that to me!"
i miss my nana
I need a hug from this sweet lady.
 I react this way every time I‚Äôm given cake, even if I‚Äôm buying it for myself
She looks like such a genuine person.
she deserves so much more than free cake ‚ô°
Delightful!!
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen
So cute! So much happy! I love it. She‚Äôs so appreciative.
I haven't recieved a birthday gift since I was like 14 years old. I'd probably react that way to free birthday cake too!
 Haven‚Äôt had cake in my bday in over 10 years. I‚Äôm a 35 year old man, I think I would even get a little teary eyed.
This seriously brought a tear to my eye. So sweet.
I don't know this lady but I love her so much.
awwe. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years as a server/busser. This elderly couple always came in at 1pm. God I loved them. One day the wife didn‚Äôt come. She had passed away. :( my boss let me take the day off. Sometimes when you‚Äôre working at restaurants you really look forward to seeing your regulars.
That made her year. This is awesome. This comment will get buried but I don‚Äôt care. This video is amazing.
Give her everything!
So precious!
I‚Äôd love to run a little cafe just so I can make these kinds of friendships
I literally feel unworthy of watching her pureness she is downright an angel
I love her already..
her reaction is priceless <3
I audibly whispered aww.. my friend heard, was interested, and ultimately awwgreed
Omg she‚Äôs the cutest. I want to be friends with her. PS. I‚Äôm a 26 year old guy.
I wish I grow old like her many decades after and people around are still as kind
Old people are cuter than babies, don't @ me
I want to give that woman a hug
Awww Happy Birthday!! We all love you and you‚Äôre adorable!!
Sweet, reminds me of my angel mother. My mother deserves her life story to be published in the Library of Congress archives. And all of love I can give her.  Love you mom!
SHE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED
What a joy to be loved.
I thought puppies were the cutest thing in the world. I was mistaken.
That's awesome
I‚Äôve watched one hundred times.
I want to hug her so bad :,)
best thing ive seen all day :)
I had the exact same reaction just watching it. How sweet üòä
I just got goosebumps, so much amazing!
Please reverse it.
As a server, this made me tear up.
She's so damn wholesome I wanna give her a hugg
She is a little cinnamon roll‚ô°
This video gave me goosebumps for some reason. This lady is beyond adorable
Oh my god that was adorable.
this warms my heart
This place looks like a nice place to eat
You can just tell she is a humble person!
What a lovely gesture and reaction!!
I‚Äôve noticed how older women are so much more appreciative of the little things...
And now I'm crying.
Fuck all the niceties, I hope they have some freaky birthday sex.
This is so sweet
Waitress was going in for the lips for a second there
Well shit i cried within the 8 seconds
This is what life's all about.
Man I gotta call my grandma
Sweet!
What a nice lady
So sweet
This is great to see! Maybe one of the first times I‚Äôve see someone truly appreciate this gesture.
Sooooo cuuute!
That is so nice! Great job!
Cherish every moment.
:)
Lovin' the best of humanity!
This made her day I bet!!!! RAK!!!
I would give her all the presents and cake!
Oh why is there never a mirror bot when I need it?
She reminds me of a scene in The Office where Tobey‚Äôs little girl asks Phyllis if she‚Äôs mother goose!! That scene was adorable!
This is exactly what I needed while studying for 4 exams :D
I need to remind myself at 52 that it‚Äôs ok to have joy like this on my birthday. I need to give MYSELF joy too! My son is 14 today and the joy on his face from the gift of black and white skull sheets, a longboard and some goofy tchotchkes is unmeasurable.
Coming from someone who works in retail:EVERYONE should be that excited to be given free stuff. The world needs more people like her. <3
Small towns really are the best about this. My grandparents have been going to the same Italian restaurant every Friday night for 20+ years and the owner still has their special table & recognizes me from when I was a toddler
I don‚Äôt know why this sweet lady is making me tear up but here I am. I hope she had a good birthday. <3
Omg she reminds me of my mom!!! My moms health isn‚Äôt well, so this is a reminder I need to give her lots of love.Eep, I may cry now.
Ohmygoodness! I bet that hug was so soft and smellnice!
I send you a Happiest Birthday from me a total stranger.   I have stolen several relatives from other people,  you are the latest.  I have  no relatives left , stealing them is my way of getting new ones & only the best.  You are a lovely lady.  Eat your cake & others for years to come.  You are now my "Auntie!"   See you next year.
They got her a gift too?!! Jesus Christ how sweet are those waitresses?
True graciousness. What a sweetheart!!
Looks like the lady who constantly complains but the restaurant has a good heart so they gave her a gift
I miss my mom.
That is the sweetest thing iv ever seen. So genuine
These regulars.  This is why I absolutely love my job.
That looks like a very sweet little lady. Reminds me how much I miss my grandma.
Just beautiful üíïüíïüíï
She is the cutest!
She reminds me of the sweet old lady with syphilis on House!
I wanna hug that grandma ;-;
I would give any of my big spending regulars to be able to wait on these two... I‚Äôm sure they are a god damned pleasure!
I don't even know her and I love her. Damn you reddit!
This is so precious! My heart can't take it!
The genuine joy on her face, oh my goodness üòç
can she tell me it‚Äôs all goin to be okay
Gosh, this gave me a cheery.  I miss my mum \*Wibble
It costs you so little to be kind. Be kind to someone today!
She might be the cutest thing I have ever seen. What are puppies?
Had something similar happen to my husband on his birthday earlier this year. Diner we're semi-regulars at (him even more than me) gave him a cake with ice cream as a surprise when they found out it was his birthday. It wasn't even my birthday, but just seeing someone be so kind to someone they only know through brief encounters at their job absolutely warmed my heart. It's nice to realize there are people out there you don't even realize that care.
So jealous...would love to have an opportunity to make someone feel that way ü§ó
26 year old dude, I can‚Äôt! üò≠
Damn this is the sweetest thing I have ever seen.
As you get older, birthdays are a reminder that time is passing. Not all birthdays are happy days. The look on this lady's face is wonderful. She is truly overcome by the kindness expressed by the staff working in the place she is eating. I feel her emotion and understand it. It is a mix of happiness, surprise, gladness and perhaps some pain. I wish her much happiness.
I wish I had the ability to feel happy like that about something.
I wonder how many people suddenly got an urge to call/see there grandma. I already know mine would ask if I'd eaten anything yet the second I show up.
this is too wholesome.
Oh my. My heart.
I know that for many people, they absolutely dread social interaction... but for some of us, the interaction with bartenders/servers is the only social interaction we get.
They made her feel so special! That‚Äôs some human goodness.
That'll be $10
As a server every restaurant has these precious few who we all care about and are willing to chip in money for birthday gifts. They give reactions like this and then leave a handwritten thank you card. Those regulars make our day despite tip. They are civil to us and treat us like family. Bless that woman and the impact she has had on her servers. She deserves the best.
I want to give her a hug and talk to her all Sunday afternoon
I want to travel to wherever she is and give her the biggest hug. She looks so touched, bless her.
Old people are awesome.
You can tell she's genuinely happy. Things like this is why I haven't given up on humanity.
Awww, people being lovely to one another
You just know she's going to smell like biscuits when you hug her.
Omg I love her
I‚Äôm sad and miss my Grandma now. I hope this lady is doing good. Not that she‚Äôs definitely a Grandma. But reminded me of her.
r/mademesmile
Like my mom, literally, exactly same reaction. <3
Oh man. This hit me in the soft place. I work in ths hospitality industry, and I've tried to make it a point to stress relationships like this. The problem is the further up you go, the farther you get from it. I miss times like this.
This is the highest upvoted post I have ever seen. And I like that.
I love my mom. I don't tell her it enough... I need to go tell my mom I love her before its too late.Wow I'm getting teary eyed.
She deserves so many kisses!
The highest upvotes I've seen ever on a post and it's so adorable
OMG she looks like Muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog! So cute!
there's a really terrible storm where Im at right now which scares the hell out of me and honestly this cheered me right up. Thanks a ton
She looks 80 but acts like an 8 year old girl (in the most positive way possible).
Look at the bitch all jelly in the background... just munching away looking like someone else's happiness is spoiling her appetite. I just got off an eleven hour shift and that lady might be a saint but at this point anything but a smile looks like they want the manager.
The lady in the very back has the poker face of Wendy Byrde
They are matching! It gets cuter!!!
The best feels makes my heart warm :)
She's so cute.. I wish her good health and a long, happy life.
She‚Äòs the CUTEST! Like a little child who is so happy and carefree. Cuuute.
Makes me want to call my mom
I love how the fellow diners didn‚Äôt frantically pull out their cell phones.
I love this so much.
Now this is quality customer service - showing appreciation towards the good ones.
I visited my local coffee shop alone and told them it was my birthday.The lady behind the counter said 'next please'.I'll never forget it xx
It‚Äôs those damn circular glasses, they‚Äôre just too cute.
Made me smile. Ear to ear.
It was after this that ex leader & commander of Berlins notorious Hitler youth Gertrud hemmel was descovered. She was responsible for the persecution of Jews, LGBT and people of African descent. all thanks to this video
I think the lady in the back lit the candle with her gaze.
Love to see these things.
The lady in the background? No one..?
Good people.
The older you get, the less amount of acknowledgment you get on your birthday. That needs to change.
This feels like it‚Äôs in Britain... anyone else feel this? :)
What a nice lady
Adorable
it makes me want to cry, it's so sweet
Reminds me of my grandmother who would always make that priceless expression of ‚ÄúWhy do I deserve this I‚Äôm so thankful‚Äù.
The customers in the back: They ain‚Äôt shit..üôÑ
I can‚Äôt stop rewatching these eight seconds of pure joy
I want to know her.
Aww my heart is melting!
I‚Äôm not crying you are!
That's adorable!
Awe, what a sweetie! Wonderful hearts all around. üòç
Lady in the back MEAN MUGGIN'!!!
This made me cry ü§ß
That's so awesome
Wholesome!
Awwww she's adorable
I swear i'm not crying
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.
What's up with the table of Grumpfaces in the back, jeez
She's so cute!üò≠
Is it r/mademecry or r/mademesmile ??
Haha, that‚Äôs cute
I love this stuff. If youre organizing a party pls invite me.
She's so hecking cute!!!
This. Is. So. Cute.
That was heartwarming :,)
Why are my eyes getting sweaty?
Made me cry
Who's cutting the onions.
Classic grandma
I needed to see this tonight
Kinda reminds me of my Mom. Rip mom
All the feels
Love the customers reaction, but awesome reaction by the waitress too. Look at the smile on her face being able to give this woman her cake. Pure happiness.
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady‚Äôs day.
Awh! I think my heart smiled, this is so pure! Its adorable how excited she was
I cried. She‚Äôs too cute, I can‚Äôt
AWWWWW
Omg this warms my heart
I love stuff like this
Just seeing her reaction teared my eyes up dang
That smile!
This is me whenever someone says anything nice about me
That is officially the cutest couple Ive ever seen. They‚Äôre wearing the same shirts! #relationshipgoals
Aw, shucks. Well that's just the sweetest darn thing ever.
I want to bake her all the cakes.
Sometimes humans do nice things and remind me not to hate them all. üòä
Why is Reddit making me cry again
She looks like a little kid. Too damn cute.
Shes so cute omg
Beautiful gesture!
True r/aww
For the business, as a customer nice to know you care.For the customer, it's nice to know a business notices you.
This is the type of lady I want to become. Surely she's a very loving person to have made so many friends in life, and she's so appreciative
She looks like a 10/10 grandma. Also for a split second you see her husband who looks like the cutest sweetest old man!
Is this in Ireland?
Damn, she reminds me of my grandma. I miss her.
You restore my faith in humanity! Thank you!
She's so sweeeeet! I wanna hug her!
You never know if this was one of the only birthdays someone acknowledged for her.
No old couple is complete without matching shirts.
Omg my heart!!
Granny's pilled out
Such a heartwarming gesture!
Wow I didn‚Äôt expect to start crying
That's goddam adorable
Why can't more of us find the joy in life like this?!

Happy birthday to her!
üò≠üò≠üò≠ This is awesome!
Uhm, so, why am I tearing up like this on a Friday night?
Just cried a little
I hope I can make someone this happy one day
This is so cute
the title is so itchy. free cake? and this why she is happy? she's happy because they care about her birthday.
That's really sweet.
That lady has to have a dog named Courage.
Uhh. Pretty sure that lady behind her wants her dead. Wtf.
Making people happy feels better than just about anything... Truth
Right in the feels
For whatever reason I sadly think her kids are assholes. They could be dead, but it just really seems like she "expects" this, just not from these people. Really great video honestly, and makes me want to call my Bestemor.
This is so hecking cute
Sometimes, the smallest gestures are gigantic to those without family or friends. Thanks for sharing this.
She is genuine, she is great!Also, this is me everyday of the week working free fake birthday deserts at chain restaurants.
Aww, my heart.
This is the cutest!
I want to cry
Hey is that my aunt‚Äôs friend. She is 69 this year
This is wonderful!
This made my heart warm!
Every single thing about this screams England
Can life be more of this please? Kthxbye. üôÉ
This is so sweet!One of the only things I miss about being a server were my regulars. A good regular could really improve my mood during a bad shift.
You can see the little girl she used to be with that expression and arm movement. So adorable!
I‚Äôm ugly crying over this
The little things really do matter
That is so sweet!
I love this! She‚Äôs so cute!!!!
I don't know how, and I've never said this before in my life, but "heartwarming" is a gross understatement.
Dawwwww I love her!!
This ain‚Äôt it chief *sniffles* this ain‚Äôt it
What an incredibly beautiful moment
The world is filled with good people
The older woman is adorable, but what is up with the woman in the back staring at the wait staff like she's deciding which one to eat first?
She‚Äôs so cute (:
Beautiful.
So sweet!!
My greatest regret as an adult is not taking the time to get to know my grandfather when he was so adamant on informing me of the Mayan civilization. Please love and appreciate those around you, having a loving family is so special.
This is so sweet that I need a couple extra hearts to even fathom the cuteness without exploding.
the act was more critical than the 'free'
Damn. I lost my grandma about 4 years ago. I‚Äôm strange about mourning death. I don‚Äôt necessarily get sad and if I do it doesn‚Äôt last long. Granted my grandma and I were not super close but seeing this almost brought tears to my eyes. She looked strikingly similar to this woman and acted in that same mannerism.
My heart is melting. This is so sweet!
Kneaders?
Can i have her as my grandma?
Scamming people into getting yourself a cake by faking birthday . Trick is sure as old as this grandma.
But does she remember is the 21st of September.
I hated getting sung to at a restaurant, I hated the spotlight. But later on I loved pranking my dates with a fake birthday surprise at restaurants. I guess it was pretty juvenile in retrospect.
Proper, surprise.
Could be wrong, but is this Bob Evans?
The sweetest!
Awwwwww there is still some goodness left in this world!!!! I love it. Every part of it. She is so beautiful! Gargh .... XD
I always loved surprising customers with free pancakes and icing for their birthday. Recently I had a little boy who had his birthday and when I came out with his birthday pancakes, both him and his dad were so happy! It made my night just seeing their smiling faces!
My heart üò¢üò¢üò¢
Shout out to the server too, the joy on her face at being able to do something like this makes me smile too :)
r/mademesmile
Welp, time to call grandma and tell her I love her.
Awwwww she is sooooo cute omg
this is so insanely adorable
I love that I went into the controversial section of the comments and I found no negative comments about this sweet little lady. I would upvote twice if I could.
r/humansbeingbros
Damn. I want a hug
Grandma poppin that collar!
She looks like what Queen Elizabeth would have looked like if she grew up middle class in South Carolina
That's so sweet!
I love old people. Yes, even the mean ones.I'm 32 and I had a client at my work named Henry. He was in his late 80s. He was always incredibly firm, abrupt and short when you would talk to him. One time, after knowing him for like 12 years and seeing him multiple times a year (I was his accountant) and never getting more than a few words from him and a glare, I mentioned that I was brewing beer at home. He immediately changed, everything from his posture to the sound of his voice, even his eyes. We talked about beer for maybe 30 minutes. It was fun and it was like talking to a completely different man. He told me about all his favorite beers, what meals he would have with each one, everything. He passed a few months after that conversation. I feel like there was so much more that I could've learned about him had I only had the time or maybe said the right few words to get him to open up a few years earlier.
This should get 100000000x up votes and hopefully remind us all that it‚Äôs the little things that matter most
This is why you treat everyone you encounter with respect.
There are people like this, and people who expect free cake on their birthday
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
I cried!
Humans being bros/friends :3
They look British
My heart!!!
Meanwhile death stare from woman near the window.
She seems absolutely gorgeous. I'm so glad the employees care enough about her to do something for her.
The people at the table behind her are not impressed.
This put a smile on my face, what a nice surprise
Aw! Love it!
I'm not crying, you'r crying.
aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww
her energy levels are far from regular!
Awwwwwwwww
Instant love!
Some people simply deserve the world

I‚Äôm not crying your crying
It's the little things people. This is what it's all about
Husband was turning around to see where his cake was
Goddamnit. It‚Äôs just so real and precious. We need SO MUCH MORE of this in today‚Äôs world. I literally can‚Äôt even.
Aww the best and the cutest reaction ever. I so wish I could give her that surprise to get that smile on her face.
She doesn't look like the kind of person who wants her face splashed all over the internet. But hey, you get that karma.
GOD BLESS REGULARS üò≠üíú
Hit me right in the feels
Reminds me of my mom
Too sweet. True happiness. Made me smile.
This is so precious and sweet that it hurts me.
Please does somebody have a source to the vid please
first time going to the popular section and AWWWW
Happy bday ma‚Äôam!
Why did I just start crying?
Oh my gosh üòç bless her heart! Happy birthday!
I can‚Äôt stop watching this.
was having a shitty day, this made it better. Sweet old lady!
This is so adorable! And she looks genuinely surprised and happy
That‚Äôs really sweet.
I love this post and thread. So wholesome.
This is nice to see.
This literally warmed my heart, a big o happy birthday to her!!
Damn it, that's real nice.
Super cute
Came to post she was adorable but I see someone else already said that. I love her. I could watch this forever!
I'm older than the Reddit crowd but please give your mom, dad and grandparents a call.  If you had that friends that passed give their parents a call.  It means the world to them.
Sooo sweeet
That is SO. PRECIOUS.
warming
This is why a service/hospitality is a real job. There‚Äôs few things as rewarding as making someone‚Äôs day like this. Tip your servers, people! -service industry professional
I miss my grandma
I'm gonna fucking die that's so adorable. I wish her 100 more happy birthdays.
That lady is nicer than I‚Äôll ever be. What an innocent human.
You all make me belive that life is worth continuing on for...
How sweet and sad at the same time. She's obviously not used to being showed such special attention. She is very precious. Happy Birthday!!!
Gorgeous
She definitely gives good hugs and smells like cookies.
I almost cried this is too sweet.
Oh no now I‚Äôm going to cry, that‚Äôs too precious.
I want to take care of her!!! Now!!!! :(Hope she has a family that loves her and treats her well!! ;___;
 Aww I want to give her a hug, she is so sweet!
She is so cute. :)
i'm gonna cry
There still is good in this world and people who deserve it‚Äîthank you!
Amazing how just by looking at her body language we can know exactly how happy she is
Love.
Mah heart. Mah souuuullll. This legitimately makes me cry though
I need a subreddit for videos like this where you see the inner kid. This video, there was that video a while back where an older woman was given a new stove, dad gets a puppy...all those videos where it makes no difference whether the person is 5 or 85, the reactions are the same.
Aww this video makes me smile. :)
Wow she seems pretty happy, you can expect at least a 5% percent tip this time!
MY HEART OMG
A little cake and love can go long way
Very cute. She has this kinda Howls moving castle Witch of the waste look about her.
That is so nice
If she was an aunt of mine I'd visit her everyday
This is way too sweet :) I hope she had a wonderful birthday!
I cannot hear anything‚Äî Is it just me?
Kinda makes me feel sad, like that's the first time in a while that someone has done something nice for her. Glad it made her happy. Ought to happen more.
this brightened my day. thanks for sharing.
I've worked in restaurants for years, and its moments like these, and customers like her, that make it bearable. Too often the restaurant industry shows the worst in mankind, but there are always those people out there that are simply wonderful.
The only person who doesn't hate restaurant staff singing happy birthday
I want her to hug me.
This makes me miss my mom. She hasn't passed away but has moved out of state.
This makes me happy
You can tell the waitress really loves her, too, and the little Yiayia goes in for a hug right away, gahhh I love this so much I can‚Äôt deal with it.
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!
Sticking cameras in their faces negates these acts
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.
I paused it at the perfect time. https://imgur.com/oHV6cN9
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.
Awe so sweet
This reminds me of me mum.
Fella's just looking back to see if he gets a piece too.
That is the exact same face my mother is excited to the point of overwhelmed about something
This is so wholesome!
we as younger people always take/took it for granted. well, at least i did. she probably hasn't had anyone make a big deal about her birthday in years. you can tell by her reaction. what a sweetheart.
Wish someone did this for me on my cake day :(
I love people like this.
So there is some faith in humanity
How couldn‚Äôt this make anyone happy
Please leave us a big tip.I‚Äôm just trolling. This is fucking adorable!
I like her
I love this.
Awwwww! Just a real person in a real moment of her own real life! So sweet!
So sweet
I can't up vote this enough. She's too cuuuuuute.
Ok done. Now let‚Äôs hit the next joint for free cake!
Why am I crying?
I literally shed a tear so stinkin cute
The free cake was worth it.
Sometimes getting a present isn't about how much big and expensive it is, but the gesture
Bless her angel heart!
She‚Äôs my favorite person of the day.Her husband takes second place for his clear confusion.
Is this in England?
This has gone so wholesome... thanks all, sometimes I feel silly cause I got so much feels.  Nice to know I'm not alone.
This restored some of my faith in humanity
God that's so wholesome I could die.
Oh my gosh old people are my favorite
Love her!
That woman at the very back seems like she's grimacing.
This is the most heartwarming thing I‚Äôve seen all year; I must hug that woman.
I wish everyone I bought dessert to reacted like this... but then again not because I would probably cry!
That's pretty sweet.
My heart just melted!
Welp I cried.
I want a hug!!
Little shit like this sticks with people
It‚Äôs amazing how such little things can often mean so much to others.
not me.....I see that comming I'm out the back door
r/adorableoldpeople
Where‚Äôs my cake?
Does anyone have a source by chance?
I just want to put her in my pocket.
Good God this makes me so damn happy.
That is just the sweetest old lady!
Hehe the little apology at the end is too cute
Aww, everyone is so happy!
I gotta say when my day just ends up being the usual malaise of depression and sadness, I can always come here for a little "pick-me-up"! The smile on her face and the overall love in this video just makes the world seem brighter. To anyone out there feeling a little down: I love you and I hope things get better!
That's what makes us humans after all
"Teeheehee, its not even my birthday"
ITS.......SO......WHOLESOME
Bad ass
Little acts of kindness is what we are missing?  (Without a narcissistic, monetary reason, judgmental,  self-centered reason.)
Sweet grandma üíúüíúüíúüíú
This is the cutest grandma I have ever seen
Aw! This warmed my heart. So sweet.
She's not my grandma, but...Happy Birthday! I love you grandma
 I can see the little girl  come out of her.
I‚Äôm crying
This is precious üòç
üò≠üò≠
Pure innocence warms your heart
Omfg I love her so much
The people in the back are [not impressed](https://imgur.com/gallery/s2oTmb0)
How sweet!!
Do greay
THATS SO CUTE
She appreciates the ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù more than the cake.
Old people like the simple things. My grandma just likes to leave the house.
Yeah, but to be fair, she knows these people. This isn't the situation the posts have been talking about. 20 servers stampeding to your table and singing some shitty birthday song knockoff is a different situation.
I could probably watch this forever...
She reminds me of my mom. My mom would have the same reaction.
I hope she had a good birthday
Grandmas kiss everyone.  I love it.
This reminds me of my Nana... She was a regular everywhere. Thanks for posting.
Nothing gets me more than a good customer service story.
Sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to be thought of and feel appreciated
Much better than a group of idiots coming out to sing happy birthday.   Cringe to the max
Oh my god, both her AND her (?)husband are so freakin' cute and make me wish I could adopt them as grandparents.
#MY FEELERS
I'm not crying. You're crying!
I got free ice cream on my birthday today.
The most wholesome fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Ccutteee
Happy cake day! üç∞
She seems sweet but I do believe it's just an ability to act out your emotions effectively. I don't always express my body language effectively or appropriately and therefore I believe I can be misunderstood.
As a long time server, regulars are what make our jobs worthwhile. She reminds me of a few of my own.
I am sobbing profusely
Definitely a british reaction
I love her and I hope her birthday was magical
my heart is melting. damn you grandma for being so adorable!
The world needs much more of this on social media!
Anyone else want to give that lady a nice 1-2min hug... she seems like such a sweet woman.
Aw, I wish her all the best
Awe, you can tell she‚Äôs an extremely nice woman. She looks so grateful that they are giving her cake and a gift. Good on you restaurant workers, the little things can mean so much to people and it shows right here.
This so cute I‚Äôm kinda crying and I have a beard we normally don‚Äôt do that
I've never cried at a Reddit post, but fuck this just did it.
She is adorable üòç
This makes my heart happy
I‚Äôm 39  a yo man,now on a train.I‚Äôm having tears watching this.
She is darling. What a pure human bean
Omg so cute!
It's not her birthday, she just wanted a free coffee 38 years ago and it's too late to back out now
Cake.
I love this, she fully embraced it. Whereas if this happened to me in a restaurant, I would be cringing with embarrassment.I need to lighten up!
What the world needs now... is love sweet love
Love your neighbors. Just like this Very cool We can all do this for someone
This is so pure.
Sometimes it takes so little to make someone happy.
I love this.
This is me when I get free anything
This feels like the response of someone who doesn't receive this sort of affection much anymore. Here's to hoping I am wrong.
Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday.
God I feel like such an asshole avoiding elderly people, the ones I encounter at my work place are usually horrible so it makes it difficult. Her reaction makes her seem like an angel compared to them. BRAVO TO THAT RESTAURANT YALL GOT ME CHOKED UP AND SHIT
This is the sort of thing that can cause me, a grown man, to break down. People don't realize how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone. You can see it in this woman's eyes what this meant to her. I'll never know this woman, but her joy is infectious. This is purely wholesome. Thank you, OP.
If it went on any longer it would have landed on r/mademecry
Awww so adorable
This made me smile!
She deserves it. How sweet!
Cake Day!!
That‚Äôs so sweet!!! Look at that lady mean mugging in the background. üòÇ She‚Äôs like I want some damn cake too.
Please hug me.
Have no idea when this was taken but it‚Äôs my birthday today. I‚Äôm so happy to ‚Äúshare‚Äù this day with such a cute lady! I hope she felt just as loved and blessed as I felt today.
I know this comment will get buried but this gif made me so happy. Her genuine joy and gratefulness reminds me of my late grandma. I forgot how much I missed her but this short clip was able reminded me of the all the good times we had
She was really touched & surprised. It was genuine. It was appreciated
I want to hug this sweet lady!
God Bless Them
Heartwarming indeed.
Oh God, I'm too drunk for this :')
that looks like someone who has been having hard times and just needed to feel appreciated. thank you young ladies!
This is the cutest video I‚Äôve ever seen in my life thus far :) she is so happy!
I'm sitting here eating fried hot dogs with Charley and I come across this video.  Good stuff for me ...
Everyone deserves kindness and love
AWWWW
Oh my god I want to give her a free cake every day
This made me cry. I used up waitress and we had some elderly regulars that definitely came in to loved and treated like family. We‚Äôd chat with them, hug them, and take pictures with them. When you get shit on by customers and are feeling down you really look forward to your regulars that help you remember you are good at your job and you make a difference to people (and they make a difference to you too.)
It's so beautiful & sweet. I'm sitting here teary eyed!
Im hard if hearing and lip read. Pretty sure she says ‚Äúdont cry‚Äù as she wipes away her tears. üò≠
This made my day
Aww ‚ù§Ô∏è In the service industry, there are certain people who come along and make it worth it. She must be so genuinely kind for them to do that for her.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Holy crap this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week.
She is so cute!
Oh I hope I can make someone that happy one day.
Do people just get adorable as they get older? Is it something like how we perceive babys as cute?
As someone who works in the service/retail industry... I fucking LOVE customers like this lady. That smile alone... I will bend over backwards for super sweet and just nice customers. It makes my whole day when someone comes in who doesn't really know me but treats me like an actual person. I have some great conversations with customers like this. If you want to avoid the pesky salesperson... ask them how their day is going. And then maybe you'll come in to some cake yourself one day
That lady is just adorable. She must be so kind and loving.
Oh my word. This made me cry. She looks exactly like my friend's Mom who just died unexpectedly. Her mannerisms were identical to this sweet lady. She always made sure we ate. We ate lots of cookies and cake. She'll be missed.
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!
You're not crying, I'm crying.
These are the moments that make service industry bearable
Why does she feel intensely?
I can't tell if she is touched by the gesture or if she just gets obsessively excited over seeing cake (like I do)
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYINGI NEED TO PUNCH A BABY
I don‚Äôt know her but I LOVE her.
My heart just melted...small thing but made her day!
Actually said ‚Äúaww‚Äù out loud at this
Fuck that is lovely.
She looks just like my grandmother. Anytime someone did something kind, she would always hold her hands to her face just like that. Love ya Grandmasota!
Am I... Am I the only one crying? cute old people are so good at making me cry.
She is the cutest.
She's so cute,  I want to give her a hug
You guys should be proud of your lovely establishment
I loved some of my regulars at my last job. They made it worth it sometimes.
Why we are here.
Some days I wish I could be half as happy as this woman
Oh my god, that's so heartwarming. Made my day.
How could you not cry imagine if this was your grandmother
My heart is going to explode due to wholesomeness
This reminds me that everybody deserves love
She‚Äôs adorable. We all agree. I‚Äôm going to shout out to her befuddled gentleman just going with the flow. Good man there.
I love this! :)
I miss my grandmas :')
Jesus
Awwww
Duuuude! I'm fuckin crying
If you still have a grandma, call her, call her as much as you can. Grandmas love that shit. Don't miss out on that bond if you have the option.
I love her.    #: ]
She's so cute, that reaction is so adorable.
She is so adorable üòò
Yes I cried. But I also noticed that that cake looks not too appetizing lmao
OSOPRECIOUS
Makes you think. A birthday to me is nothing to be excited about. A birthday to someone else is something special.
Humans are interesting, aren't they!!! She is so cute üòÄ
This is what makes my soul smile.  Thanks reddit.

THAT, is what America is supposed to be    .
Wholesome moments are nice

This made me aww out loud
Man I can't take this right now, over here bout to make me cry fuck
That's the nicest thing I've seen this morning on the internet, other than a üêï video.
I lover her!!!!
I miss my mum
This is what makes the world go around. Love.
Omg that is too sweet.
That so cute, a cake and a gift. But I would also add that her husband looks like Warren Buffett.
Not just cake though, also a gift.
[deleted]
This is exaclty who I want to become when I grow up üòä
So cute
Good to be nice to people. Dont really need to film it though.
She looks like she gives the warmest, most welcoming hugs.
Loved this post!!
She is so stinking cute!
This lady reminds me of my grandmother, just pure love. Call your grandparents and tell them you love them.
Her little tremble and the hands clenched under her face.  She is adorable.
She is so precious.
Holy fuck that made me smile
I want to give her a hug. I hope she had a fantastic day.
She‚Äôs precious!!!! Look at her reaction üò≠üíï‚ù§Ô∏è agh ma heart
So many serve safe violations, but the joy just over takes it!!
Damn. This is the snuggliest thing. Love it.
I‚Äôm not crying my eyes are just sweaty
This hits home more than I can say. I work at a restaurant between jobs currently. Ive realized even more so the smallest things can make a difference in someone‚Äôs day. I now try to do little things for people to make them feel good. There‚Äôs no better feeling!
Sooooo cute
Beautiful
As a server that just got off a terrible shift this really made my night!
Just wonderful. Tell her 67,000 people reacted to it
Thanks Reddit
I buried my great grandma today and this really reminded me of some great memories, thank you internet stranger.
Plot twist, Hallmark commercial
This sort of love that's pure and straight out of the heart without expecting anything in return is very rare
I love some of our regulars that come to the casino where I work.
Hell I didn't smile I cried :')
Melted my heart. You can see she was sincerely touched.
I am a hormone casserole right now and this got me sobbing. These kinds of interactions give me faith in humanity <3
So precious
She looks like a grandma in a children‚Äôs book. So cute.
YOU BASTARDS JUST ALMOST BAD ME CRY! My eyes all tested up and shit!!!!!!! üò≠
God she is so adorable I'm going to melt.
This is SO EFFING heartwarming, watched it a million times already! Old people are the future of this world! and that's the tea, sis.
Aw how sweet!
I watched this at least 20 times straight
I'm crying.
Wow I love her so much.
Aww this is so cute
Man!  If that‚Äôs what a regular customer gets, I wanna see what a special customer gets.
My father in laws birthday is 21st of next month what to give him!
It's always wonderful to see a kind hearted staff in a restaurant.
Good bless her soul!ü§ó
I've never seen this many upvotes on a post yet.. And that lady is adorable
Got her! r/unexpected
To all the people that has birthday today, I wish you happy birthday.
That‚Äôs awesome
Humble people makes the act of giving so much fun.  Lovely.
Awww wholesome
Instantly lifted my mood!
I recently quit my job because they refused to do anything like this for both long time customers and employees. I dig it.
That smile just warms your heart
So sweet
Jesus eff. Stop. That was beautiful.
heart touched
I love her so much she's so adorable ugh üò£‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠
Why am I CRYING
Adorable üíú
I want that joy!
This reminds me of the diner my papa used to frequent on a daily basis! The ladies that worked there just loved him dearly. They even let him bring in and keep his very own coffee cup in the diner. After he passed, they closed the diner to attend his funeral. They would do special things for his birthday(s), too. So sweet, just like this post. This lady is so overjoyed, she has tears! I love people that look out for the elderly. This lady is so sweet!
This is so wholesome and I love it!
So sweet!
This is amazing!
What a sweet moment (‚Äò:
This is why you take care of the good people, not the jerks looking for free stuff.
wow. This was kinda touching. I'm still not crying though....sniffle.
This is really a peaceful moment ‚ù§Ô∏èüëè
God damn, she reacted like a Disney character would. She's far older than me, yet far more innocent. I wish I was that sheltered my whole life.
Ok just fuck me up fam
this makes me miss my grandma...
Spread happinessüòçüòçüòç
W H O L E S O M E
This melts my heart, shes so cute
Guessing this is Britain. Anyone know where?
Oh Jesus... that just warms the heart.
Love
Heart. Melted.
Love it!! That was as genuine as it comes
Nice
Adorable!
That's not a cake. That's merely a biscuit.
Kindness and appreciation. So simple yet so increasingly rare.
Haha, I‚Äôm imagining the people in the background as cute little toddlers oohing and aahing over it. Everyone here is so cute!
That‚Äôs so pleasant! üòä
Holy fuck 79k upvotes good job boys. Also this was very sweet
That's lovely,.
That reminded me of my mom
I was looking at it and got chills.  Thank God this isn‚Äôt r/Wellthatsucks
I absolutely love this
Life is sad
I love this
Oh, look, I'm weeping
Fuck this is too cute, is there anti-eye-bleach?
She looks like the lady I drove home to her senior living place.
Ultra AWWWWW!
I'm literally the old guy sitting behind her who carries along eating.
She is so sweet!!
Cute
I wish I could upvote something twice
This is so sweet. When the staff at a cafe does something like this, that's how you know she's a special customer and nice person. These people serve hundreds of people a week, if not more.
Holy adorable
Truly amazing.
That‚Äôs so sweet
I love her :))
True regulars are the best.  Even the stingy ones that you can hold a conversation with; you end up learning a lot and end up caring for them.  I honestly miss my serving life because of people like the lady and gentleman in the gif.
Who knows?
So adorable!
Awwww. I'd love to see the full video of this! So utterly adorable.
What?! No cake smash!?
Anyone picking up on that glare from the lady down at the end?
A regular waitress‚Äôs reaction too!Cuteness overload.
You can see the glamour on her face.
I love her
Old people are the wisest, most wholesome, and most adorable people I know
 I needed this today. Thank you.
The more i watch this the harder I cry
That's really sweet
Wholesome post thanks for sharing
awww she looks so grateful :‚Äô)
I love her reaction.
It's really so nice to see how happy she is. Gotta say I'm pretty jel...
It is not about the cake being free
Jesus Christ. I‚Äôve never seen such genuine raw happiness and appreciation in my life. Amazing.
So cute üòä
This is great
See the happiness on her face, it's really really awesome. The art of happiness is to serve all. To be truly happy, we must think not only of how we can help ourselves, but how we can help others.
so precious
She looks so excitedüòÑ
This is the cutest thing I have seen on this subreddit <3
Old people are so cute.
I needed to see this right now
She's a princess that day!
She looks like she teaches botany at hogwarts ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The smallest thing can really have the biggest impact.
I love this so fucking much
The way she puts her hands together and smiles <3 I want to hug her so badly
Aww I wish there were more people like her
r/MadeMeSmile
Can I hug her?
It was my birthday (September 21st) I hope you we share the same birthday so I know someone had a good day!
The old man looks like Warren Buffett
Awww such a grateful Grammy. ü§ó
The sweetness and lack of entitlement.  So lovely ‚ô•Ô∏è
I can only hope for this greatness.   I'm smiling honestly.
I love reddit!
She‚Äôs so cute!
What a sweet fucking lady üò≠üò≠üò≠
I want her as my mom #2
I bet bet she gives fantastic squeeze hugs. I really want to pinch the hell out her cheeks. So stinking cute.
Sometimes I see thangs that make me wanna cry. This is one of them. Too sweet.
damn I wish my grandma looked this happy, shes normally in a static state of mean mugging but even when shes ecstatic she looks no where near as happy as her. I can't blame her with all the conditions she goes through with her body now though.
I wanted to cuddle her and protect her at all costs.
This is amazing. It gives me all the feels.
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
She makes me miss my Mama so bad.
The little girl inside her is healthy and fine üòä
Little tear.  It‚Äôs just so nice seeing ppl being kind to each other.  We are attracted and exposed to so much toxicity online, but I still see more good than bad in my day to day interactions.  And this is lovely.
This is too adorable.
This makes me sad for some reason
Today is my birthday, and what a sweet video to start off the day.
This makes my heart feel good üòä
This may be the sweetest thing I have ever seen, she's so thrilled!
MUST.... PROTECT
She looks mortified.
Both dudes in the background are not all that impressed. monch monch monch
Aww
How lovely...
Awwww!!! That is so sweet
I‚Äôm 26 yeas old, but I want this lady to adopt me to be my grandma.
She‚Äôs beautiful! That smile lights up a room!
Heartwarming is the perfect description
ok, mah heart! I want to hug that old lady
I just got out from a horrible day at work and this just put the first real smile on my face that I've had all day. Thank you so much for posting this.
*Gets shish kabob ready*
This is what I love about local businesses and regular customers... You build this type of bond between employees and customers, where each of you know so much about each other‚Äôs lives that you could possibly be mistaken for life long friends. There‚Äôs a local lunch time diner near my clinic that I‚Äôve frequented for so long that my regular waitress and I know more about each other‚Äôs children than we probably know about anything or anyone else. She‚Äôs become a dear friend and if for some reason we‚Äôre not there on our normal days we will call each other to make sure that everything is okay. I‚Äôve literally gotten a call while I was hung up at work because of another clinics spillover with her frantically worried that I was the individual mentioned in a late breaking accident story on our local news site. I‚Äôve done the same when she wasn‚Äôt there and I found out she was at home sick. I made a lunch time housecall to assure that it wasn‚Äôt anything major.
I wish they do this to me at my regular Starbucks but they just sigh, and roll their eyes :( "Its grande right?"
It‚Äôs nice to start my day off with a gif like this.
I love humans
Look at that old fucker in the back like ‚ÄúThis is what my coffee took so long for?!‚Äù
On the other hand Starbucks refused me the free birthday drink saying i am still at the welcome level. Sigh, what a confusing world.
This is beautiful. Such a simple act of kindness produced an overwhelming reaction of joy from this woman and you can tell how much it meant to her. I hope every single one of you is able to experience happiness as pure as that as you grow older.
I respect this post and her reaction. Great in every way.
I wish I could feel so strongly about things again, so fucking numb all day everyday, god bless that granny, I envy her.
I want her to be my granny.
I audibly aww‚Äôd, this is so sweet
This made me feel warm, thanks.
Oh shit, is this in Santa Cruz?
This post will become top posts of all time in lesse than a week
Unexpected gifts are the best.
You granpa are so lucky to have such a cute and sweet companion through your whole life. Lots of love and hugs!
She is lovely pure and innocent üòç
You just made my day. Thank you
I bet she'd be an awesome Grandmother!
She kind of reminds me of Danny devito appearance wise
I'm a reg at fast food restaurant and i always expect them to slip me an extra nug or pack me up with a shit ton of fries. It never happens.
This gif is gonna break reddit.
I was feeling a bit shitty about my day. I'm not anymore. Thanks OP.&#x200B;
She definitely came from a fairytale.
I like that you can see her husband look at the camera and quickly hide out of shot.
Awwww
Awww, so cute üòç
I'm soooo late to this, but my heart man....I'm a bitter over worked 31 year old man but this made me smile so damn much.
Sort by controversial:Everyone in is wholesome.Didn‚Äôt expect that.
Aww. This warms my heart. She looks and acts just like my late great aunt Ike. I miss her so much!
Finally not an animal or baby on this sub!
This is so precious
I gasped. Do you know how hard it is to make me gasp? It's really fucking hard.
It's heart warning
I love how's she starts reaching out for a hug before the waitress even goes for a hug, like she really wanted to hug her for such a sweet gift
I can‚Äôt get enough of this
The feelsssssss
She seems completely taken aback by what they're doing.  It clearly meant a lot to her, it's great to see them taking the time to brighten her life.
These are the type of people I love (the customer)
That woman at the back is cold
Bless bless bless
aww. way better than getting yelled at by parents for being a loser who moved back into their apartment after a disasterous fuckup at school lmao i ate cake in my room by myself it was nice
Her smile  is worth more than gold and all the valuables in the world.
My Brovaries!
well i work as an security guard and sitting here like (im not gonna cry im not gonna cry)! ;p
BlessHappy birthday xx
She reminds me of my mom somehow, I want to hug her so bad üò¢‚ù£Ô∏è
Anyone got a link to the whole thing? :(
This is truly heartwarming and it makes my weekend
Even my parents don't wish me ,let alone the friends and extended family and I am just 25.This had tears in my eyes.Wish someone wished me liked this üòí
The expressions of the people in the back, ‚ÄúWhere the F is our free cake?‚Äù
Okay, this is awww material, hence the people.
Right now I'm off to hug my nanna
I‚Äôm totally not crying
Fuck she looks so happy
I want to hug her and ask her about her day. So sweet.
Cutest thing ever
I never get the feels.This lady pulled my heart. So sweet and pure
Too cute!!!
I should learn from her.
My mom still lies about her birthday whenever we're in a new place.
These little things change the world
AND gifts though.
That is the sweetest thing I've seen all day
This is so sweet
This is exactly how my mom would react!
I hope one day I grow up to find joy in the little things in life like her.
It's nice when people notice that you exist.
Awwwww <3
I'm not crying.Why are you crying?
I‚Äôm very hungover I can‚Äôt have things like this please stop
I hope she knows how much everyone appreciates her on this subreddit :')
r/bettereveryloop
Even it's only a cake. We have to remember it's mean a lot when older generation are normally forgotten.
Good for her :)
More of this in the world, please.
The power of a free cake is astonishing. I run a non for profit which profits free birthday cakes for kids who wouldn't otherwise get one. The looks on their faces is the most touching thing. My 400 volunteer bakers who give up their time warm my heart <3 we've recently expanded to provide cakes for homeless and elderly, never thought I'd see someone so grateful for a cake.
Happy birthday
All the feels. This is lovely üòä
She's obviously learned the secret: take delight in the little things.
I'd give this post gold, If I had money.
Why is the internet full of cute pets and kids. We want more cute grandmas and prandpas
This is the sweetest thing. Mudita'd out of my tree.
This would be much better with sound.
this. is. god. damn. beauitful.
I love how many people love this as much as me
Wheres ma cake
 I hope you do too good
This deserves to be the top post of all time
[Free cake!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/225/822/tumblr_lw6jpleAiG1qb1pw7o1_500.gif)
She's like a Pixar character come to life.
Aww bless her
#metoo
Oh God that's so cute it's actually too much for me lol
I'M NOT CRYING...YES I AM.
Omg
Thats so cute
That is seriously so sweet.  Thank you for posting this.  Happy bday, Ma'am.
This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen. Good job OP!
I love this random kindness it's very beautiful. The birthday girl is simply so sweet, she deserves this.
I can't help but feel like this is in the UK. It feels too wholesome to be in America, and too quaint to be elsewhere.(If there's audio I didn't hear it, I've got my sound off)
And a bag which may contain anything. It could even contain a cake
God bless them all....
This makes me happy.
Old people deserve respect, they're the ones who built our nations and I think they should be allowed to live out their golden years with dignity. It saddens me to see the conditions some old people live in even in countries like Norway and Sweden.
almost made me cry

Servers redditers, what is the appropriate response if someone saw and asked for a free cake on their bday
Why am I crying?
The husband is adorable too!
Experimentally, by the number of up votes. This may exhibit the mentality of human kind.

She is so sweet! I love her üòç
It‚Äôs people like her that help heal the world.
I'm standing outside the BMV and this about made me cry in front of 20 strangers.
That made my hangover slightly more tolerable. So cute.

THIS is what needs to be the most upvoted thing on Reddit.
There's too much... **WHOLESOMENESS**
I'm gonna stick my neck out and say that's a fruit scone, not a cake.
omg her reaction is the most adorable thing
My grandma passed away. Can I have this one?
She's in the witness protection program :(
Aww! I love the animals posted here, but this is definitely my favorite so far. I want to know this sweet lady!
This shows the love for her as a regular customer. Its wonderful to see people appreciate others like this. I teared up, its so adorable!
The cuteness is over 9000!!!
I‚Äôm not crying. I‚Äôm sweating through my eyes.
Awh, the way she acts reminds me of my mom
Awww what a sweet soul
 I just want to hug her and wish her a happy birthday.
This is so beautiful
I love old people. The cuddly kind, not the mean kind
Daww what a lovely woman
This fills my heart with so much delight
So sweet! Love this
Happy cake day!

I work near a certain Subway that I go to lunch at every so often. Dude who runs the place knows me by now and is super cool. Indian Immigrant, I know his name but I'm obviously not gonna put him on blast, who's like a coworker at this point. It's odd how we bond to people.
[deleted]
Bit over dramatic
I bet shes evil, yells at random people for skateboarding, flips people off and honks her horn cuz road rage and tries to hit people when they record her for that etc, but looks sweet here
Hey guys we're making a video for reddit,please act surprised so we can get up votes
I miss my Grandma :(
Pretty sure that‚Äôs Cruella de Vil in the background.
That's Bilbo.
This is how everyone should react.  It's your birthday.  There are many birthdays just like this one, but this one is your's.  There have been so few, it shouldn't be taken lightly.
English people are disgusting
So awkward...
I thought they were gonna start making out tbh

Old people love free things
The "I'm a lesbian at heart and this is the most action I've gotten in a decade" look. We've all been there.Not as bad as when I saw a dude kiss his mom on the mouth in the Walmart parking lot though.
boy does she look like the stereotypical person who fucking loves cake.  She's holding her jowls in preparation for the impending sweet tooth comment.
Man fuck that old lady. Asian girls only

How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy?
Found him on @dash.dog
It‚Äôs a dog eats dog world out there.
Go Mariners!
Safeco!!
Go M‚Äôs
Being a Mariners' fan this season sure is ruff.
Hot dawg he did it!
Did he get to eat it afterwards? He nailed being adorable, he deserves compensation!

There's a grate-type barrier behind the dog on the frontpage GIF and there isn't on this one. Looks like the same dog, bandana, and hat but might be a different game.
LITERALLY THE PPST BELOW THIS ONE IS THE VIDEO OF THE PHOTO BEING TAKEN LOL
Lol, I saw a vid of this being taken. Glad to see it worked out!

He is a super star! He is smiling ear to ear and does not appear to mind his human dressing him up! Such a lovable face. Give him a belly rub from Karen in pennsylvania!
If you go on r/eyebleach there is a video of this guy taking this photo
I SAW THE VID WHAT A GOODBOY!!
AYE GUYSI FOUND EM
This is too many levels of meta
I swear a video of you taking this picture was just on my homepage.
So meta
How many hot dogs were harmed in the making of this photo?
The final product is just as good as the behind the scenes.
Awww! I just saw a video of this good boy trying not to eat the hot dog!
Does this count as r/tworedditorsonecup ??
This is right above the video of the guy watching you get the shot in my feed :)
 I saw these literally right next to each other
Meta.
I thought it was a Muppet at first.LOL!
HE DID IT!!!!!
How do you train or prepare a dog to not be afraid of all the lights/sounds/people?  I have a boxer pup that loves people and other animals. I would love to take him to a baseball game, however I took him to the beach and he was afraid the whole time, tail between the leg, didn't want to say hi to anyone - totally not like himself. I'm worried he would be the same at a baseball game.
The internet is an amazing thing.
I swear I saw the video of this being taken somewhere else on here.
R/aww doggin it
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again
How much did the M's lose by?
Don‚Äôt get much better than a ball game with your best friend.
Someone give this dog a brand deal!
Selfie dicipline att its finest
Im sure the woofer wouldn't be as happy if he knew the name of what was in his mouth.
As unhealthy that is, I would really like to see goodboy to eat his prize. Some closure for little people :P
Definitely better than I was expecting!!!! 10/10
Boop
You know this dog is too much like a human
lol. He started eating that hot dog 2 seconds after this was taken.
Cutest Baseball Boy Ever!!
My good boy is wicked smaht
Go Mariners!
I saw you making this photo
Oh yeah, love that dog on dog action
Alright. I need a Golden Retriever. Now.

Saw the video earlier and was hoping that the guy was a Redditor. So glad he is because this picture is too freaking cute!!
MY HEART IS EXPLODING FROM ALL THE HAPPY
I was waiting for this since this morning!
Who needs a kiss cam when you've got a good boy cam?
Yo someone else got you in a video of you making this!
Is this that dog from an earlier reddit post when he was trying to get the photo?
I have sat in this section.  For a girl scout night.  We were the lucky recipients of the very top row.  This is an annual event and we had top row seats two years running.
Maybe it's just the uploaded picture but I didn't like the background focus and quality found it distracted from a good shot.  Did some quick edits to add a bit of lens blur to background and some slight balancing to reduce the highlights.https://i.imgur.com/KNK8Ufd.jpg

SOMEONE POSTED A VIDEO OF THIS PERSON TAKING A PIC OF HIS DOG AND PUT IT ON THE SAME SUBREDDIT...REDDIT-SEPTION
He's rocking that handkerchief.  12/10
The photo is cute but I can see from the behind the scenes video that your dog is overweight. Feeding him bread, cheese, sugar (in the sauce), and overfeeding are all bad for him. Especially since this breed characteristically overeats if they can. Please look after your pup by keeping him healthier.
You sound suspiciously like a dog, OP.
All American pup.

Oh my god I was so sad that I couldn‚Äôt see the finished product!
How does this dog have more willpower than I do?
Cognitive dissonance at its finest
Should make this my tinder picture lmao
Someone took a video of you taking this photo and upload it to Reddit
Where did the fence go?
Knew this was Safeco immediately. I might need a hobby that isn't baseball.
wait, isn't this the video?
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there
Awwwwww
I get that reference
I saw I video of you taking the picture
If you look at the gif, then the picture, they are two different dogs... and sadly two different hot dogs :(
Did you let him eat it?
I wonder what the convo was like between the owner of the dog and the other guy who was recording him take the picture. He probably made the front page and told him to post it.
omggg all that hard work was worth it!

Man, how did you manage this pic?   Do you have video of this being set up?
10/10 is a sadly low rating. I'd say more like 12 or 13/10
I saw the "making of" gif on r/eyebleach and am so glad the finished result on here too!!
This dog might be the best dog ever.
Wait, isn't the process of taking this picture on r/woof_irl? https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/comments/9djyr4/woof_irl/?utm_source=reddit-android
There's any other pic which was u taking the picture of the dog
Different photo/place, doesn't have the fence behind him that was in the video.
I feel like this pup is taking his grandpup to his first ball game haha
u/seattlemana
Your dog looked obese in the other video, feed him better or he might not be around for that much longer.
This is what it means to be an American. Golden Retriever with a hot dog at a ballpark.

That is one HOT dog.
Hold on I just saw a video on r/aww of this exact video being taken!?!
I hope he didn't eat any mustard that's a big no no for doggos
So can the redditor who took this picture, and the redditor who took a video of this guy taking a picture just kiss already? Meet, have dinner together....Clearly you two have a cute love for baseball doggo in common so..

Next have him chugging a twelve dollar beer!
Photography is the story I fail to put into wor
Good dog got to enjoy his good dog right after this.
He got the photo but did he get to eat the hot dog?
This is GREAT! A wee piece of doggo internet history. Hope you gave him a heckin pettin afterwards.
This is why I love reddit.
Safeco field?
Did someone really spend 20 bucks on a stadium hot dog for their dog to eat?!
Too bad it's over exposed.
Title gore
I swear that I just saw a video of someone recording you reading this photo
A redditor taking a video of another redditor taking a picture of his dog. Mind blown
am I the only one who saw the video of this pic being taken XD
I feel no different about this picture than I would about a picture of a fat man, taken at the worst possible angle, holding a hot dog in his mouth, which is also crusty and dripping with saliva. This is disgusting. Why is this on the front page?
m e t a b o y e
I smell a ruse
Can someone provide a side-by-side of this and a screen shot from the video? Something looks different and I can‚Äôt figure out what. I‚Äôm on mobile and it‚Äôs not going well.

How many hotdogs did this take?
Wait theres no gate behind, how many hotdogs did he eat that day?!?!?!?!?!

Oooo that looks like such a tasty dog I obviously meant the hotdog
Awesome
Is this cannibalism?
Hey I saw you in the parking lot earlier, that's how I know you.
There's no fence behind him like in the video we just saw. How often do you do this?
Safeco field yeah? Beautiful stadium

I'm having fits just imagining how many places the ketchup and mustard may have gone. That's going to be one dirty boy.
337 = EET
Impressive - that's impressive stamina to NOT gobble up that hot dog.
This goodest of boyes deserves all the treats
What a good good boy!
Goms
Bark at the park!!! True to the blue...
The bestest boy ever
Go Astros!
The hat! üòç
can doggos have ketchup and mustard?
Ew, who puts ketchup and mustard on their hotdog.
Next stop r/photoshopbattles
I really want to see him finally scarf that thing down!
Love the single dark whisker on his face üòç
Doggoop
taaaaaake me out to the baaaaaall gaaaaaame
I think this pup got more than one hotdog, the background is different in the video that was just posted.
Go M‚Äôs!
When did this sub started to allow canibalism?
Cannibalism
how did you get a dog into a ball park lol?
He better have let him eat that hot dog!
They allow dogs at the baseball field? That‚Äôs cool üòé
That's gonna be a pretty damp hot dog
NANAI!?!
Go M‚Äôs!!!
Considering the price of stadium food, this might be OPs most expensive picture of their dog!

Go Ms!
Isn‚Äôt that cannibalism? (Get it???)

Well hot dog!
That there, is a good damn boy. Pet him frequently.
Best thing to happen at a Mariners game in 3 months!

I think this is a different photo from the video. The video had that gate/grate behind him.
Nigga I watched the video of this... knowing later id see that gorgeous face =) !!!
DID HE GET TO EAT THE DOG AFTER?!
If he didn't get to eat that hotdog imma go John Wick on your ass.
Some say he's the goodest boy around
Is this canabilism
Is the hotdog real
Was probably a $12 hotdog
That's a nice fuckin dog.
This is cannibalism.
What a GOOD BOY!!  Wish I could give him hugs!!!
Safeco Field!
HE IS THE EPITOME OF HAPPINESS
MARINERS DOGGO IS HAPPY. This came out so well too! This is adorable! Pup's probably happy with a good game, a good frank, awesome owner, and the W they got haha.
Amazing
he has toothpaste on his beard
The hat just makes the whole picture perfect I can‚Äôt üòÇ
Maybe this cute pooch could get the mariners to the playoffs.

How many hot dogs has that dog held in its mouth? The other picture had a railing/fence behind it./r/Eyebleach/comments/9djypy/good_boy_trying_his_hardest_to_pose_with_food_at/
My dog would just gobble the whole thing up.
12/10 doggo. 7/10 shot, should've positioned that giant light behind his head.
Feeding a diaper hotdog is so bad. Esp one with cheese
I get that it's cute but why are people okay with this? Doesn't it feel kind of scummy to use your pet in this way?
The best boy!!
I love how people just love animals. Nature‚Äôs way of giving human beings 100% natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety solution through unconditional love.
Best ... Day ... Ever
Hey wait a second!! This picture was taken from a different location than the video we all just saw! Did the good boy get 2 separate hot dogs? Did you take the first one out of his mouth and, then move to a different spot!?
The original Post can be found under instagram: @dash.dog
Someone took a video of you trying to get this photo. I saw the effort of the dog trying his best to not eat the hotdog. Glad the photo turned up perfect.
A happy Mariners Dog!!
Dodger Dog!
Who is a good boy?You are a good boy!
Yay!! This is what I needed after seeing the other post!
This has made my day!
Go M‚Äôs!
Hope he got to have that as a treat!
The guy was trying to get the Mariners logo in the shot but failed. I'd say 9.5 out of ten, but good boy is still good
Gotta love a walk in the park
Let's go Mariners! Let's go Good Boyes
Good boy!
Someone clipped the process of doing this what a obidient dog
Go mariners!
This is an amazingly good boi I have to guard my dog from stealing MY hotdogs, no way I could have every managed this with any of the dogs that have been in my life.
He made it to the HOME page!Get it guys? Home? GET IT?
do dogs like mustard?
Can confirm from prior content; My heart is now a puddle.
This is so cute. And I love that it‚Äôs at my home stadium. I wanna go to Bark in the Park so bad, but I can never make it. He looks like such a good boy!
Best ballpark hotdog salesman ever!
Thank you, I was left on edge
HOw'd you get him to not eat it long enough to take a picture?
Adorable!
How'd you put food in a Golden's mouth and not get them to devour the whole thing in .2 seconds?
What team was this?
What a beautiful photo! Well earned hot dog I'd say!
I certainly hope that good boy was allowed to eat the hot dog after posing so patiently.
‚ÄúPhotos taken moments before disaster‚Äù
I was at Safeco yesterday!  Simba cam was funny.
Is that mustard
THERE WAS A WIRE FENCE BEHIND DOGGO IN THE VIDEO, WHERE IS IT IN THIS PICTURE!?!?!?!?
May your goodboye never be hit with the sog.
It's a dog eat dog world.
Priceless!!!!!!
Drooling hot dog boy!!So cute!!
This is adorable. He's ready for the game now.
Just saw the vid of someone recording the gentleman and his pupper in this pic!! r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
I saw the video like an hour ago and I was thinking I really would enjoy seeing that photo he took. And you delivered! Amazing! What a freaking cutie! Bravo!! üëè
Must be a different dog. The video showed a metal fence behind it. Sorry guys.
I like how a good boy with a hot dog acquired more up votes then Burt Reynolds dying Lmao
Pretty sure that has to be some sort of mental torture...Nice cap though
Yassssss!
Why on earth do the Mariners need public funding for upgrades to one of the best parks in the league? Doesn‚Äôt the city have a major homeless problem?
I read in my dog training manual that dogs do not like mustard.  In fact, if you put mustard on a cracker somewhere-- they will condition themselves to not taking treats that are left out.    Just thought I should point out that dogs don't like the same flavors we do.
Feed Nana
Been waiting for this all day
help this is too darn CUTE
Doggo?
ok i just saw a photo of a man at a ballpark trying to take the perfect picture with his dog. Is this the sequel?
Finally got some closure.
Animal abuse

This is not the photo from the video... there‚Äôs a cage background on the video..How many attempts did the owner make?
This is cool because he's not swimming in a pool of drool.  Dog has control!
My dog would have eaten that hotdog in at least 0.2947 seconds
The self control alone gets a 10/10, good boiiiii ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Safeco field! I'll be there Saturday.
A hot dog eats a hotdog.
is that unhealthy for a dog?
Safeco does a bark in the park night?
They allow dogs in stadiums now?
Love that this was at Safeco

Damm look at those condiments!

Should dogs eat hotdogs?  I've heard the salt isn't good for dogs, so Ziggy doesn't eat any hotdogs, am I right about this?
Good boy did
Holy shit! This is hands down the best mind fuck thing I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. If you know others throw me

Big baby!!!!! Of whom I love
There was a honeycomb looking fence behind doggo in the other video. Just sayin'. Still cool.
I know the Mariners are a little behind in the Wild Card race, but that is a super empty Safeco Field. Come on, Seattle fans!
That hot dog must be ridiculously **soggy** after waiting so long for the perfect moment.
is it safe for a dog to eat all those ingredients
Favourite all time on reddit
I was just there the other day!
How many hot dogs did it take? He ate at least 1
Take me out to the ball game        Take me out to the fair          Buy me some hot dogs and throw some sticks         I don't care if you take a few pics        'Cause it's nom nom nom on these steps here        If I don't eat it's a shaaaaaame!

I met this dog at the game last night. Can confirm, goodest boy.
It's dash!!!
Hate to be that guy but theres no reason to put ketchup and mustards on a dog treat (i'm pretty sure mustard isn't good for dogs anyway) Very cute picture though
Do this at a stadium in one of the multicultural parts of Western Europe and people will be constantly asking/telling you to keep your dog away. I can't go to the park with my dog without seeing some scared weirdos run across the street to get away from my small dog.
Get‚Äôem while they‚Äôre hot!

Yaaaaassss

What a rollercoaster of emotion

Video of you taking this
I just want to point out that the hotdogs at safeco are like $15 a pop so thats 15 bucks right there
They let dogs into baseball stadiums??
Fuck I want a hot dog now

Mariners Field?
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again
I can't believe you bought a $25 hot dog for this.
Good boye loves his M‚Äôs
Small world indeed
RESPECT... even I would have ate the hotdog before the picture.
These here were my worry when I was a kid thinking dogs would think we were eating dogs so I called them franks and such this is a really good picture too thankyou for sharing this too

Of course he‚Äôs a resditor
Is that nacho cheese of mustard? If it‚Äôs nacho cheese that boy knows how to dog :)
How can the dog not eat the hotdog right away ?
Wasnt there a fence behind the dog in the video? I guess they tried another spot
Yeah, good boy
I've watched this post climb from 1K to 100K+ and it still deserves more. If you consider your dog as a child then this is the picture perfect moment.
Go Mariners!
But did he get the hotdog?

Is good boy a Dbacks fan?
Damn I been following this dog on ig for a while now, I used to see him around the breweries when I went! Good boye confirmed
"Does a dog REALLY need mustard on his hotdog?"

If you're going to give your dog a hot dog, at least skip the sauce. It's too much salt for them.

Has nobody noticed that this pic is taken from a different spot than the behind the scenes video? There is a enclosed railing behind the dog in the video.

didn't squeeze the slightest bit. nice.
False. Nothing showing the Mariners. . .You've got to think about the next level: On doggie night, your dog had a mariner dog.
Wait a second. Didn‚Äôt I see this photo getting taken in video earlier today?
Go Mariners! Looks like Safeco to me.

Is bread, ketchup, and mustard bad for dogs? Or is that not harmful for them?

Anybody else the video of the guy taking the photo is in a different location then where this photo is taken? the video has a fencing guide behind the doggo while this one the fencing is located on the right side of the doggo, and the fencing on the right hand side of the dog doesnt even match the one in the video.
I'm so glad we got to see this.

That poor doggo had to have the worst shits from that cheese.

I can see why he ate it. Mustard must have dropped
(Hope it doesn't have onions)
This is so adorable! I wonder how many takes this took to get?
but where‚Äôs the mesh fence behind him ..........
Unfortunately this dog is in poor shape :(

Calling BS on this. Staged.
WOW! And how long have you been brain dead? I'm not nor most people reading this. I call bullshit! For the gas money you spent, supposedly, meeting a total stranger, in New York yet, you could have walked to a pharmacy and bought one. Good story for those that believe it.
Your dog is obese. Become a better dog owner, talk to a veterinarian and practice what they recommend you do to let your dog lead a healthier life.
You can't put ketchup on a hot dog at a baseball game. It should be illegal. Luckily it's still a 10/10 dog.
Look at that fat cat.  That cost more than my dog spends on food for a whole month.

That's a cool human you got there. What breed is he?
This dog looks like "The Dude"https://i.imgur.com/R7DvL1v.jpg
Chewie?
What kind of dog is Ben? He looks like a shaggier giant version of my mutt-of-unknown-provenance.
My dog's name is Ben. I have a beard but he does not.
Why are Chewbacca and Kevin Smith hanging out together?
Is this the dude from duck dynasty
He is awesome!!!
He looks like the dude, man.
Ben needs a brow trim bro, he can't see the funny looks you guys get lol
You're probably overwhelmed with replies, but I wanted to say thank you.Ben made me laugh during an upsetting nerve pain episode. Snortles were produced. You both made my day a whole lot better :)Please put a Chewbacca bandolier on him.How much does he weigh?
The guy looks like youtuber Shay Carl.
His leash even looks like Chewbacca‚Äôs ammo belt
HOV Lanes HERE I COME!!
What breed?
What a handsome dog.I heard dogs which have hair covering their eyes sometimes are afraid of walking around because they can't see very well.If he moves around very carefully you should try to give him a hair cut, it wont harm him and when it doesn't improve anything for him it'll grow back.Any way give him some bellyrubs from me.
That seatbelt makes him look like Chewbacca üòÇEdit: Just figured out it was a leash üòÇ
More pics please
I'd follow that dog's advice
[Ben needs the Wookiee seatbelt!](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/chewbacca-seatbelt-cover/)
You got him so you could ride in the carpool lane didn‚Äôt you?
And he has a lovely dog too!
Which one is Ben?
And you let him drive?
Anyone else think that was Chewbacca??
Can he fix the hyperdrive?
Whats the dog's name?
Punch it Chewie!!
Prince Eric called. He wants his dog back
Pls do that dog a favour and cut its hair. Allow him to see.
You ever dress up as Han Solo? You could try to use Ben as a Chewy decoy for carpool.
Looks like the Dude, in dog form
I hope you don‚Äôt take this as an insult because you have a nice beard, but damn...his is better.
Cut the hair in front of his eyes back
When you get into the car do do you say "Punch it Chewie!"?
I thought it was The Dude...man
Yup haha
If this dog could talk It would sound like Sam Elliot and give you sage advice.
Give him a cut, needs to see.
Hopefully you're on the way to the groomer to fix his bangs, that poor dog can't see.
Wrong sub, but where could someone find those shades?
Dude! You know Tim Allen?!?!
Ben The Wookie Solo
for some reason he reminds me of The Dude. he's awesome.,
"Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
Hey ben im human sized too but dont feel the need to brag about it. Thats a cool dog though.
Give him a Chewbacca utility belt and it will be largely self-explanatory.
Punch it Chewie!
Chewbacca..
I didn‚Äôt know Keemstar has a dog.
Ben looks like the kind of dog I'd like to have a beer with while coming up with some crazy business ventures we could blow our life savings on.
 You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. That cannot be a dog. That is surely a sasquatch you have taken from its native environment. Return him, or her,  to their home else a legion of sasquatches/sasquatchi/sasquatcheses (Not really sure what you call a group of these beasts, if anyone knows please enlighten me) and their sassy hats shall picket your home.  Return him, and stop using the car pool lane!
Ben has some nice sunglasses.
My dudes out here looking like Chewbacca
Please put your wife's seatbelt on!
He's a helluva co-pilot, but when it comes to locking in the auxiliary power, you'll have to tell him twice.
Chewbarka
Punch it Chewie!
Han and Chewie 2018
He needs a replica of Chewbacca's bandolier, and you got yourself a damn good cosplay k-9.
Chewie, is that you?!
I can‚Äôt be the only one who at first glance thought this was a guy in a chewbacca costume.
Yeah we get it, it's Ben, he has a beard and is human sized - but what's the name of the good boy on the left?
He needs his bangs trimmed so he can see too!
Okay and who's the dog
Cruel to put sunglasses on him though.
Dude, dog can't see.  Cut dogs hair.

You have to buy a right hand drive car asap. The looks gonna get even more funner.
He needs sunglasses
He is the dog equivalent of you, I love him

Give him some sunglasses and it's jerry garcia.
Punch it Chewie!

#youshotfirst
Ben, the two of us need look no more.  We‚Äôve both got the beards we‚Äôre hoping for.  Ben, you always call shotgun  Which causes confusion.  But, Ben, my friend, you see,  You‚Äôre best doggo for me.
Please trim your dog hair, poor thing can‚Äôt even see
[removed]
I‚Äôve been told it can negatively impact a dog‚Äôs vision health if their hair is long enough to cover their eyes. I know you may find it difficult to grant him eye contact as it will be nearly impossible to resist when he begs for a bite of the steak you grilled up for dinner... but it‚Äôs in his best interests in the long run (the haircut - not necessarily the steak).
never ceases to amaze me how couples look more and more line each other as they age
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.very hansom doggo
Are you wearing a zipper hoodie, a flannel shirt, and a graphic tee? Could you be more internet?
Wtf cut that dogs hair dude
This needs to be posted in r/beards too
But, but that's a wookie.
My dude....
At least trim around his eyes, otherwise i love the long hair. I always recommend sanitary shaves. Keeps the awesome hair, cleans up the nasty spots.
I so thought it was a chewie suit
He needs a groom
Get the hair out of your dogs eyes.
Ben can‚Äôt see shit
This poor dog probably can‚Äôt see through all of that hair, and has no way to communicate that fact.
LOL!!!! THAT DOG IS WEARING SUNGLASSES!
I'm gonna be the downer and say:Dude maintain your fuckin' dog's fur length because that shit looks awful for him.
Run you fools!
He looks like my uncle Donald not even joking lol
Pretty sure that‚Äôs high school nerd Scott Howard
Cool shades Ben
Far out man.
I bet he feels well like one of the lads
Needs a t-shirt
Ham solo and chewie for Halloween pics when they happen pls.
Im just impressed you can type so well with paws
Needs more bandolier
If he started speaking I wouldn't even be surprised.
Is Ben a Giant Schnauzer?
which one is the human?
I‚Äôm almost sure that if you call him by his name he will actually respond ‚ÄúWHAT?!‚Äù.
Which one is Ben
Chewbacca......just needs shades!
Also, Ben is on the right.
Ah filming of the new Hangover movie

[deleted]

You look like Jayson Werth
Um, is that Keemstar... At a StarWars set? I've seen it all.
Nah, that's Chewie.
Put sunglasses on him!
He looks like A Chewbacca
You need to get his fur cut more regularly.
"Punch it chewie!"Revs engine and shoots off
Both cute!
Ok... But what about the dog?
Buy him a pair of those sunglasses. Would look cool on him.
Do you always let him drive?
Be nice to Ben, he drives
Wear sunnies and cap. So?
He needs a crossbow and you need a black vest.
Hov for days

"Ben, the two of us need look no more.....Ben,we both found what we're looking for."~Micheal Jackson about a rat. No, really.~ And it works even better here. Bearded Ben wins life.
Hi Ben! Nice blue sunglasses you got there.
Enough about Ben, who‚Äôs the guy with the sunglasses?
And what‚Äôs the dogs name.
Good Boy
Can you do some trickshots for me aswell?
Lots of Wookie related comments here (as there should be) but I think people want to also know how often you two ride in the carpool lane without issue?
But whats the dog's name?
I need tips on how you keep that beard so glorious.
Bigfoot is real!
Hi Ben,  I'd like to know the Wookie's name.
plot twist: Ben is the one with the glasses!.
I think you guys could get away with driving in the carpool lane.
Don't you think ben would be happier getting a haircut so he doesn't have most of his vision blocked by his hair lol
What is the dog's name?
All that dog needs are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and he‚Äôs fine
Your dog looks like he's in a southern doom metal band.
You‚Äôre a babe.
Anyone know what car this is? Looking in the reflection of the glasses it looks like a citoren but I'm unsure.
Traffic? Give him some shades and get in the HOV lane
Do y'all use the same beard oil?
More pictures, please. He's lovely.
Is there a subreddit for dogs who look like their humans?
Is your dog /u/petermayhew?

How old is your majestic doggo?
One of them has no sunglasses, and the other one is named Ben.
You really should get this seatbelt cover for your passenger seat:  http://shutupandtakemymoney.com/shop/star-wars/star-wars-chewbacca-seat-belt-cover/
Hey Ben, nice dog!
You need to get a recording of Chewbacca's wookie speech and blast it on your stereo.
Any more photos?
Who‚Äôs a good handsome bearded boy? Huh buddy? It‚Äôs both of you!
My partner and I are having a disagreement.I think this is Chewie, she is very specifically saying that it is Jeff Daniels from Dumb & Dumber wearing a dog suit.Please confirm who is closer OP

We know about Ben. Now we want to hear about the dog.
Now you need to wear a shirt with him on it and vice versa.
Does he have any abilities to heal? Serious question here...
I feel like you're driving with Jeff Bridges if he was a dog.
What kind of dog is he?
I put a sailors cap on my dog once and sat in tabs still traffic. It was by far the greatest thing I have ever done because of the looks we got.
Do you always use the HOV/express lanes?
I appreciate the fact that people really do resemble their dogs , or dogs resemble their owner. However you want to look at it.
What‚Äôs the dogs name??
Nice to meet you Ben. What‚Äôs your dog‚Äôs name?
Hi Ben, awesome dog you've got!

If you don't start the car then dramatically say "Punch it!"  You are missing out on some golden opportunities.
Chewbacca Mom!
Which one is Ben though?!
Hey Ben, What's the dog's name?
They say dogs do look like their owners sometimes.
That‚Äôs a really good looking dog.  But I just have one question.  Wouldn‚Äôt it be best for the dog to not have hair over his eyes? I‚Äôm not a dog owner, nor do I know much about them.
It's Han and Chewy in between trilogies!
Dogs posting on reddit now... great.
Which one is Ben?
Ok Ben but what‚Äôs the dogs name?

Poor boye can't see
Straight up looks like a Wookiee
That ain't a dog, this dude just picked up an alien. That's all.
~~K, but what is the name of the dog?~~
If I were a cop and you used the hov lane I would not ticket you
I was thinking of a Star Wars joke
Reminds me of a sunday afternoon Disney film from the 80s
Ben is the new leader of this world.
Low key thought it was chewbacca
How bad does Ben stink?
Ben the dog or dude (jk)
Reading that from the point ofview of the dog makes it even better
I have a tiny version of Ben
Get that dog a wizard hat, STAT!!
I see you taught your human to drive. Good drogo
And he can drive apparently
That dog looks like 1/3 of ZZ Top
HOV lane pass for sure
https://youtu.be/VjQMpBb1gps

[deleted]

Ben looks like Norman Reedus
DJ Killer Keemstar and Chewie.
Han and chewy

Chewbarka
Does he owe you a life debt?
Never seen a dog wear a hat backwards before.

Nice beard! Cute dog. 10/10
Ben sure looks like a great companion.
Oh man, what a neat dog!

Looks like Steve McKenna...and the one on the right does, too.  #threesheets
Wookies count for carpool lanes right?
Ben, 26Works at a micro brew. Used to be super into skiing, but ever since he bought his snowmobile he's more into that.
But what‚Äôs up with that dog?
With the shades, he looks like the fourth member of ZZ Top!
Nice
What is the guys story?
Can you please cut the hair out of his eyes? Or does he drive like that to protect his eyes?
Chewbaca?
You can probably use Carpool lane with Ben on board lol
Good boy is also good as a HOV lane companion!
Hi Ben; who is the Wookiee to your right?
I had to do a double take because you look EXACTLY like my boyfriend, I thought for a second ‚Äúholy shit he finally got Reddit! But whose dog is that..??‚Äù
I'm Ben and human sized too, but since I am human, that is less interesting.
He looks like he slaps the bass
Halloween idea: Han Solo and Chewbacca
Subaru?
And his dog looks pretty cool too.
The Dude abides
If The Dude were a wookiee
What's the dogs name though?
nice shades,Ben!
I thought this was a Chewbacca cosplay.
Obviously you have to get him a hat and shades too.
Wadiyatalkinabeet?
Why isn't Chewie wearing his belt?!?
What‚Äôs the dog‚Äôs name tho
That mofo is from the Wookie planet Kashyyyk.
He is the Dude.

Dude in a dog suit, or dog in dude suit...?
Literally thought he was in a car with a Wookiee
Perfect for the HOV lane.
Now that, is a sexy pair.

Laugh it up fuzzball
That dog is huge üò≥
Looks like briard.
Morning SamMorning Ralph
Ben is what I want my dogs to be, but they are all females, so I guess I‚Äôm getting them Halloween beards for the truck now üòÇ

Chewy.. I have a bad feeling about this..
He looks like the drummer from Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Chewie?
This looks great! Can‚Äôt wait for Jeff Bridges‚Äô next movie.

I'm not entirely convinced this isn't a man in a dog suit.
You look like the guy from dude perfect.
But what's the dog's name?
I hate the fuckin Eagles man! - dog probably
Ben seems nice, but what's the dog's name?
Yea and what‚Äôs with the random bearded guy on the left
Gorgeous.  My BC/shepherd/schnauzer cross had hair almost identical to this.  When she wasn't cut for a while it looked like she had big floppy socks on.
Full beard-who wore it better?
Which one is Ben?
He has glasses too
which one is Ben?
They say dogs look like their owners.
‚ÄúPunch it Chewie!‚Äù
And the one on the left is a dog
U/blgke

What's the dog's name?
Ben needs a hat too.  Or a headband.  And some shades.
Ben looks like Bruce Vilanch.
Cool. So who's on the left?
He needs a leather sash so he can be your own personal Chewbacca.
Is it hard for him to see? No bs, I'm genuinely curious.
That beard is groomed better than mine.
Ben looks like a wise old hippie.
I love ben
Are those Recaros?

Missed opportunity not naming him Chewbacca
Hodor
Does your dog listen to Slayer?
You guys look high af btw. I live this so much!
I can‚Äôt tell which one is supposed to be Ben from the decription
Hey at least you get to use the HOV lane!
You can drive in HOV lane.
He looks like Chewbacca's hippy uncle
Thought this was chewbacca
This is the type of dog, you put sunglasses on and then drive in the HOV lane
You guys should start a Texas blues-rock band with furry guitars!
Wait a second, is the dog talking or the owner ü§î
they say dogs look like their owners..
Your dog kinda looks like Chewbacca
Tommy Chong meets Gandalf.
Wilfred?
Wow that's awesome that you taught him how to drive a car! Ben is like your personal chauffeur now. Also, it kinda looks you have a beard as well.

Traffic? You could get away with using the carpool lane
You should drive a Jeep with the doors off.
"Hey Sassy, get in the fucken car. We're going to the water park.""... whatayatalkinabeet?"
Punch it Chewie!
Ben seems like a really chill dude, but when he opens his mouth to say something it's really deep and everyone will listen.

Honestly looks like Chewbacca if he was a biker... Or a family member on Duck Dynasty
But what‚Äôs the dog‚Äôs name?

Yeah, it is funny to see a pup wear sunglasses.

Dayumn .. your very own diamond lane buddy
It took me a while to notice the dog. I thought Ben was the man and thought you got weird looks because he looks like a Walmart brand of keemstar
Ben is awesome!
Scooby's more lit cousin than Scrappy-Doo...   Totally-Doo

I thought it was chewy at first
He is from Bendor.
Ben is blind asf
He looks big enough for you to legally go through the carpool lane with no one else but the two of you in the car.
üòª
You need to give him bangs so he can see. He also needs a seat belt.
I needed the laugh today. That's really awesome .
This dog looks blazed as hell.
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.
The dog gets weird looks too sometimes
Carpool buddy that gives one access to fast lanes in California :).
Nice!!!
Bit u triied that be chewiy u liein
Traffic? Why not HOV? More attractive and convincing than a cutout.
Would look even better is Ben wore some sunglasses.
I think the hat probably throws people off.
That is a wookie.
Carpool lane here we come.
This post features some of my favorite things: big adorable, bearded males! 5/7 would pet both.
If Chewbacca and The Dude had a son.
What did you feed your beaver ?
Giant schnauzer?
Haha it might be Chewbacca's cousin
Keemstar?
More like he is a beard. You should get him some plaid and coconut beard oil so he can be a hipster.

He looks like your Wookiee co-pilot.
Please tell me you both have dressed like ZZ Top for Halloween?! .... that would be..... perfection! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Haha HOV labe all day! (High occupancy vehicle- Texas, like carpool lane elsewhere)
Ben looks like a gray haired Wookie.
Tell Ben to keep his eyes on the road!
Your dog looks like a stoner
Sounds like the dog wrote the caption about the driver
My grandfather would drive around with his Irish Setter, Heather, in his pickup. My grandmother would get calls saying he was driving around with some redhead.
wookie
This picture reinforces the theory that people look like their dogs lol
I love dogs like this lol
Wait is Ben the guy on the right?

‚ÄúChewie, get us outta here!‚Äù
At least have the hair in front of his eyes trimmed by a dog groomer please.
Uhh... which one is the dog?
You should put sunglasses on him when he rides with you.
He needs a hat like yours...to keep his hair out of his eyes.  You are both handsome fellows!
Preparing the jump to hyperspace
You and your groomer are doing a great job with his coat. Absolutely love it.
Beard buddies for life!
Cut his bangs back so he can see better and get that good boi some shades!
A rare sighting of domesticated Chupacabra.

Can't tell if the human posted this, or the dog...

"WAGRRRRWWGAHHHHWWWRRGGAWWWWWWRR." - Chewbacca

Jeff Bridges has serious range
You should put a long sleeve collared shirt on him and see how long you can use the carpool lane.
Looks like the dog Ambrosius from the movie Labyrinth. Now you just need Sir Didymus sitting between you two.
Scruffy the Sasquatch? Is that you?
Sup keemetar
Is he a Briard?
Damn furries!
Coolest dog I've ever seen. Should be named IT
He looks like The Dude.
that dog is a dwarf wookie
He does look like a Ben! Great naming skills there..
Please cut his hair that is blocking his eyes. If you truly loved him you will get rid of that inconvience so he can truly see life for what it is. He does not have the ability to see through his hair as cool as it makes him look it his a terrible inconvenience.
lmao fake lumberjack, nice flannel shirt, kempt beard and backward hat.
Chewbencka.
With the way his hair covers his eyes he reminds me of Sam Sheepdog from Loony Toons.
He's "The Dude"! I mean just give him some shades too.
Soooo, which one of you is Ben?
Chewie, we're home.
This dog needs to be voiced by H Jon Benjamin.
What the hell! That's Chewbacca!!!
Remember Chewbacca? This is him now. Feel old yet?
poor thing can't see! give those long hair that cover his eyes a trim! Lovely creature you got!
I think I'm the only one who's oddly scared of this doggo.
Chewbacca???

Omg!! I want him!!
Looks like Tony Beets in dog form
You‚Äôre shaycarl aren‚Äôt you

Han and chewy
chewbacca is that you?
My dog isn't human size, but she's got a wicked stache/eyebrow/goatee combo going.
Okay Ben, what‚Äôs your dogs name?
You need to dress Ben up as The Dude for Halloween. Basically just get the sweater  and some shades and you‚Äôre  done.
What's the dogs name?
I'm fat.  I have a beard.  I brushed my dog's hair over his eyes.  I have sunglasses that are blue.  I posed.
He's like Chewbacca'a third cousin twice removed.

He's the Chewy to your Han.
At first glance I was equally as fooled as those who give fun glances in traffic.  Not to mention his name is fucking Ben.
No shit, he's driving a car! What about that cool dog riding shotgun tho?
Chewbacca!!!
You have your very own Chewbacca!
I read, "He was a beard." And was trying to figure out how a dog can be a beard.
Briard?

If they ever need to cast a new Cousin Itt, I'm sure he'll get the part.

He looks like a cross between Chewbacca and Gandalf.
For some reason I thought was Tom Segura
I'm pretty sure that's some guy in a fury costume
Who's Ben's girlfriend in the passenger seat?

I don't subscribe to this why did I get this a fucking notification
Cool picture but it‚Äôs super unsafe to travel your pets in a vehicle without them being crated. Let the down votes begin!!!
I‚Äôm glad you have a seatbelt on him. Can‚Äôt stand people who let their dogs/pets roam around freely in their cars when driving.
Can he see?
[deleted]
They do say dogs look like their owners.
KILLERRRR KEEMSTAR
Give that dog a man bun.
Looks like the plays for zz top

You could ride in the carpool lane with that good boy
Trim his bangs dude...

Very cute doggo. Very, very cute human.
A friend's aunt lost her dog this way when some asshole rear-ended her.They make seatbelts for dogs.
"Oh thank god you're here. These other dogs are CRAZY. Can we *please* go home now?"
Those are some Pixar eyes if I‚Äôve ever seen them lol.
*on mobile* Double clicks dogs face for ultimate zoom potential*fucking dies*
This is how I decided my dog was the one for me when he was a puppy. My mom let me choose a pup from a litter of probably a dozen pups. I found one I really liked because he kept sticking around me while all the other puppies ran around creating chaos or stuck to my sis/mom/the owners. We had to leave to go to the bank and get money once we decided. I told the lady specifically that I wanted "this one." and she promised she'd keep an eye on him since he had about 10 brothers/sisters that looked the same. We came back and all of the puppies were mixed in and she forgot to keep an eye on mine. As soon as we played with the puppies again all of the puppies began running around except one. One puppy stayed with me the moment we got to see the litter again. That's the very  pup I knew I was looking for. The rest is history!He's turning 20 this year and still going strong! Edit: here's a pic of him! https://imgur.com/a/hreMz
That one gorgeous lady. She make any new friends? Breed please?
Beautiful good girl! She looks a lot like my Link, is she a shepherd/border collie mix? Give this good girl a treat for me!
Oh she is perfection

I would love to see a photo like this of a bring your cat to work day. It would be quite different.
She's such a good boy
Treasure that look of love. I just lost my boye last week and I just came to say, treasure it beyond all measure. Treasure the treasuring. She‚Äôs beautiful and you can see the adoration in her eyes.
L is for the way you look at me.
Reminds me of a girl heh
And not a stitch of work was done that day, I hope.
My dog doesn't even look at me in public. He deosn't quite understand "stranger danger".
Treasure the time you have with such a good pal.
That faceeeeeee :D
Had a cousin with a sheep herding dog, and when my parents would bring me and my twin brother to their house if one of us crawled out of the room the dog would pick us up by the shirt and gently return us to our parents. Like "scuse me this belongs to you"
That‚Äôs the ‚Äúare you ready to go home‚Äù? Look
This is such a sweet picture. ‚ù§Ô∏è I love bringing my dog to work for half days. She‚Äôll let other people pet her for a few seconds and then run back to me or lay at my feet under my desk, always reminding me that I‚Äôm her favorite. üòè
My cat makes me feel the same way, except instead of showing me love she just begs me for food.
I aww‚Äôed out loud.
Are there treats? Someone said there would be treats...
What a sweet face!
Those eyes!
My heart! üò≠
What a good girl!
They like me better.
Relationship goals.
WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THAT?? We found our dog as a puppy, abandoned on the side of a road in Monument Valley, Utah. We thought maybe she is German Shepherd and Australian Shepherd mix, but yours look IDENTICAL. This is exciting. I'll take my answer off the air.
So cute!
I love her "eyebrow dots" !
Is that a standard poodle on the right of her?
Your dog is beautiful! What breed is she?
Sir you stole my dog.
I want a dog so bad :(((
Looks like my pretty little lady! http://imgur.com/iNHPMCD
This is very nice
She is a part of your world. You are the whole world to her.Thinking this always makes me sad :(
Awww, she got an adorable face! <3
Or perhaps you're just holding some treats
As long as you don't work for United...
That‚Äôs the most ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù eyes I ever see
‚ÄúDoggo‚Äù is going to be the reason that I unsubscribe from this subreddit.
Find someone who looks at you the way this dog looks at OP.
Anybody know what kind of dog this is. Because I have a rescue that looks exactly like her.
Oh. Dear. God! That is absolutely heart warming and breaking at the same time. What a stunningly beautiful photo of her love for you!
That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm getting a dog and treating it with the best love and care in the world.
I have a beagle I‚Äôve had since he was a puppy and he loves me, but the lab I adopted as an adult LOVES me. He looks at me like this. Like I‚Äôm the whole world. It‚Äôs so sweet.
‚ÄúDave, seriously, take me home.‚Äù - Dog
Thank you OP. She is so pretty, that I want to keep her as my wallpaper.
Poor janitor.  Going to be a feces festival tonight.
Adorable
That's a face that just says "worry" lol
Haha, dogs sure do love humans!
My dog loves everybody, especially new people.  Because of this he kind of likes me the least out of everybody on earth but it sounds worse than it is.
More like favorite anything. You > Food > Butts.
That is just the SWEETEST face! AWWWWW
When we got our dog an Aussie named Dub, I became second fiddle in this house. The adoration that boy has for my husband is awe inspiring.
Is she a Border Collie German Shephard mix?
Generally, if I do not do what I want to do....I might get a treat!
I thought she was wearing a tie
"like wow there's so many other doggos here and this is so fun, are you sure this is okay pack leader?"
Oh the lemon bassett hound made my day!
Shes so cute, that look is pure love.
animals are good companions to relax the environment
I love this so much.  She has love in her eyes.
I love her beautiful face! Bless your baby!
Who's a good girl? You are!
Good doggo!
I wonder if when you leave, she thinks you're just going to play with dogs and people.
IS THAT A BASSET HOUND????!?!
That‚Äôs adorable.
Posts like this make me want a dog so bad.
Aw, she looks exactly like the Aussie I had as a kid. rip Bob, you were a good girl

AWWWWWWWW.  Dats cute is heck.

Both of you are so blessed to have eachother  :-)
I could not have a dog this cute. I would never get anything done, I would just give pets and belly rubs until I got evicted.
Oh man, [she looks just my dog!](https://imgur.com/gallery/YyNwQ)Parker's half border collie, half lab.

So nice!
Dog day camp attendant here. My girl is the same way. Even when she gets to see all of her favorite friends, she still checks in with me every other minute. Ugh, I love her so much.
That looks like a big fat thanks to me!
And here I am in love with the basset.
A happy story:"...my fave hooman was there, and it was the most dog butts I ever sniffed, the end.  Best day ever."
Wholesome
Please tell me you gave her a good belly rub after this picture was taken
There's a study that says dogs prefer the company of humans, even dogs who were raised by other dogs.OTOH, wolves prefer the company of wolves, even wolves who were raised by humans.
So wholesome
She‚Äôs beautiful! What‚Äôs the breed mix? Man, she‚Äôs wonderful!
This makes my heart happy!
I wish my dog liked his own kind.
How cute <3 even my dog makes me feel same.. kuddos!
My cat always sucks my ears when I go to bed
Oh my goddddd..... The feeeeelsssss of this post
‚ÄúHi, I love you.‚Äù
Today this sub truly has lived up to it‚Äôs name!
üò≠üò≠üò≠
That is one happy doggo right there.
Thank you for cheering me up OP.  This made me tear up badly.
Spent ~10 years doing dog daycare, my dog joined me the first few years but eventually got banned from play group for trying to "help" me too much
That is beautiful!!!  My girl does the same thing; She may have other dogs around, or a few people, but she is always focused on me.  That, of course, is true love in one of its most treasured forms.  Thank you for sharing that awesome pic!
A VP at work would bring her dogs to work all the time.  Nobody else was allowed.  Her dogs pissed and shit all over the place.  She was not the one who had to clean it up, of course.
Any time there is another living creature around my dog forgets I exist until it's gone.
Like she's surrounded by a sea of chaos, but she is perfectly tranquil just staring at you.
I took my boy to the dog park for the first time Sunday. I was hoping he would tire himself out with the other dogs. It was cold so my SO and I walked the fence line to keep warm and all he did was follow us.
Now my dogs go and try to get themselves readopted. If I take them to a dog park I have to physically remove them from their new family.
What kind of doggie? Mine was similar loooved her sich a sweetie like yours toohttps://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7jawrq/my_beautiful_15_yr_old_shepherd_mutt/
We don‚Äôt deserve these mother fuckers
The Bassett on the left is looking for snacks
"You're the only one I know at this party!"
That's the "I love you" look. Similar to what my dog does when I walk him
Oh I need one of those! Just that look ofLove on its face! Awwww!
‚ÄúI LOVE IT HERE, AND YOU‚Äù
Whoa that looks exactly like my dog. Do you know what breed it is? I got mine at a shelter and they weren't completely sure
this looks like my dogs "i'm stressed please take me home" face
Plot Twist: She was eating Lunch.
This one literally brought me to tears. I had to return the dog I just adopted because it kept biting me, including in the face that got infected and I need to take antibiotics for. I see this and I weep knowing there are good dogs out there but am sad that I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never find one for me.You hug that dog and make sure it knows it is a good dog.
Or that she still needs to go potty.
This says it all about dogs. Better and much more dependable than people. They don't judge and just love you, period.
We don't deserve these creatures.
Just stopped crying over over my little buddy passing, opened Reddit, aaaaand fuck I need to get another furry friend. Life's so empty without em
I have a beagle I‚Äôve had since he was a puppy and he loves me, but the lab I adopted as an adult LOVES me. He looks at me like this. Like I‚Äôm the whole world. It‚Äôs so sweet.
This is precious. It's like your each other's calm, in a world full of chaos.
We have a dog at work that is like this with her handler. She loves everyone and everything, but the complete and utter devotion she has for this guy is something to see.  If he leaves the area for even a moment and she can't follow, when he comes back she is just deliriously, knock people across the room her butt and tail are wagging so hard in joy happy that it kind of pangs my heart to see.
That is awesome
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs!
I had a 95 lb lab mix that we adopted from the Humane Society that followed me so close his nose was always bumping on my butt. I had to be careful not to trip over him in the kitchen.  And I never had any privacy when I went to the bathroom.  He passed away a couple of months ago in January. I miss him so much.
That is a beautiful dog, can't wait til I move into a bigger house to have my own.
Everybody‚Äôs watching her, but she‚Äôs looking at yoouuu

OMG! So much love in that little face
Do you know de wey
Now that's love
I need a dog..

Shot with iPhone X
Are you hiring and where do I apply?
She knows that you‚Äôre who brought her to the dog party.
This says it all about dogs. Better and much more dependable than people. They don't judge and just love you, period.
Iiiii only have eeeeeeeyes foooooooor youuuuuuuu
Awww what a sweet puppy
My dog does this thing where he sits next to (or on) his favorite person in the room. You really know who his favorite is.
That's an awesome pic of an awesome dog! üòÄ
My dog does this when we have company over. She makes sure to get love from everyone but always comes back to me
I wish a man would look at me like that
English shepherd?
Beautiful dog.
This dog is so adorable, I can't handle it.
She looks so happy
Is this bring your dog to work day?
What a lovely pup!  Looks a lot like my dearly departed lady - so pretty!
Where are you working and are they hiring? Location doesn't matter am prepared to move
Can I quit my dream job to come work with you?
Her face screams ‚ÄúWHATS GOING ON?!‚Äù
This is so precious
Oh my heart. It‚Äôs exploding!
Or she thinks that you're her favorite dog.
Where do I have to work that has a "bring your dog to work" day?
I work as a handler at a daycare and bring my husky every day. Ha
We don't deserve dogs, they're too good for us.
What a perfect baby. This picture is SO great!
And then I saw her face and now I'm a believer
I have yet to reach that level of admiration from my dog. She just touches me with her backside.
Dogs are the best.
Beautiful dog!
I'll stop the world and melt with you
I can't even go to bathroom without my dog wanting to follow. I love him though :)
My dog loves everyone the same :‚Äô(
Cute
Aw so many doggos :D
What breed is she? She reminds me of a dog I grew up with.
I thought I was dead inside. This pick proved me wrong
She's beautiful!
Two seconds later someone else has food and she's gone
My dog would get me fired because he‚Äôd bark like crazy at any dog I gave any attention to. He‚Äôs a Boston and lost the head over the weekend when he saw me go across the road to say hi to someone‚Äôs sister and he massive pit. He didn‚Äôt care as I am his and he was ready to fight for my love.
Meanwhile, my dog's favorite person is my sister. She hears my sister's car and she starts desperately looking around for "gifts" to give her, usually socks or a rag. I come home after being gone all day and I get nothing. There's no reason. My sister doesn't do anything special for her. I take care of all of her needs, love her, play with her but she still loves my sister more.
Favorite* assuming you have you food or no one else has food.
What kind of dog is this cutie?
The thing I don‚Äôt like about Bring Your Dog to Work days is that from then on your beloved pet thinks you leave them every day to spend time with a bunch of other dogs. How sad would the dog be now?
The look of love.
What a sweet face!!
This is how I imagine doggy day care centres a like.
Don't pet them! those are my pets.
I work at a kennel/daycare and my dog does this too. She will occasionally join in the chase but she'd prefer to sit on my lap(she's 45lbs)  or around me.
Fucking AWWWWWWWWW!!! That face!
God I needed this. Thank you.
This photo is everything and she's beautiful!
https://youtu.be/LuN6gs0AJlsGood doggo
Stand there much longer without giving that dog the pets and you‚Äôll soon lose that title to Jared from down the street!
Had to bury my dog today. Thanks for this photo
Can I have your coworker's basset hound?
Her face says it all. "Thank you for bringing me to this really cool dog park!"
i just want someone to look at me like that
That's just what parent feel when their human kids decide to hang out with them instead of running off with the other kids
Chester!
One of my favorite dogs was literally like a cat when me and my buddy would call her she would look at us with these squinty eyes and then turn and walk off like a cat! Just randomly thought I would share
Haha
":D"
üòç
Beagle butt!
I LOVE DOGS SO FUCKING MUCH ARRGGGHHHH
Awwwwwww!
I also get to bring my best friend to work everyday at a doggie day care. I just got a dream job out of state and I can‚Äôt take her from my family and I‚Äôm not only devastated to not spend all day with her I won‚Äôt even be able to see my old girl everyday üò¢
She looks so happy to see. So adorable. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You've just made me want to go home and play with my dog. Thank you, I have 6 more hours of work
what breed is she?
What a good girl.
Person?
It's hard to love a human but got damn animals are just to easy
My heart! Ohhhh my god my heart!!
I work in a vet clinic and used to bring my dog to work with me every day. She would want me work all day.
Why did my eyes just tear?
Omd!
That dog looks like today is the best day of her life so far. Yesterday was the best day until now, but today is definitely the best day yet.
y'all I'm melting
Awwwwwe so precious!
She's really adorable.
With eyes looking at you like that, wife her!..o wait
Why are dogs so precious? Do they not understand how terrible humans are ?
This is my pooch. But her look would be nonverbally saying, "can we play ball yet?".
u/maddiefaulks
That smile is to die for!
Just curious, what doggie daycare facility do you work at? Because I work at one too, l, named pooch hotel.
She looks like my girl Annie and it makes me so happy because she looks so happy and precious I can't
I'm in a bind at the moment and can't afford a place a midsized dog deserves... This post made me tear up/not give up hope... Thank you!
Dog smiles are the fucking best.
Nothing feels better than being in the receiving end of that look.
I've never worked anywhere that people brought their dogs into work :-(
This pic made me go awww and then i rad the subreddit name and honestly yeah
Where do you work and are they hiring????????
I wish that was true with my dog.
I had to put down my 14 year old chihuahua two days ago. I used to complain that she was always underfoot, now I just miss her.
u/LearnedBravery she is adorable
adorable! those pretty eyes
This is where you go everyday? Why do you leave me at home?!?
Warms my heart :3 hugs for doggo!
/r/girlsmirin
My dog wouldn't do that. He'd be too excited to play with the other dogs and would be all like 'yea dude I'll check you later, leave extra food out in case I bring a friend back'.
Those eyes.... ‚ô°
She‚Äôs a very good looking dog! What kind of breed is she? ‚ò∫Ô∏è
u/babyykayyy22
This is where you ‚Äúwork‚Äù? I hate to break it to you, but you, Sir or Madam, are dead because this is actually heaven.
This would make a great jigsaw puzzle! You should see if there's a place that could custom make you one.I like it. One dog's lookin, one way, the other dogs are lookin' the other, and the one in the middle's sayin, "Waddya want from me? I ruff you!"
/r/wholesomememes
Is this in Seattle by chance?
Wow.... there are no words for that look üíï <3
You are my reason to smile.
I love dogs . Because I think dogs knows the feelings better than human.
You have a lot of friends, she only have you. You may be the world to her.
That's how I knew of al the dogs in the pound...
She is beautiful!
I wish my office had a day like that.
I think she is trying to tell that "it's been fun but I am ready to go home now". ha ha
She's a shepherd, so of course!
I have a teddy dog named Jerry. Whenever I go out, it will be sad.
Precious!  I love her sweet expression.
My heart ‚ù§üêæüê∂‚ù§
@learnedbravery is she a Australian Shepard, can't figure it out
Ahhh ok, thank you, she's so happy :)
My dog would totally ignore me around other people and dogs until I dragged his butt back home haha
/u/bloodboy12
So true.
simply awesome!

oday, we see a lot of dog owners make complaints like ‚ÄúMy dog always barks at people!‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy dog is not playing with me!‚Äù. Moreover, we even hear about a dog killing three people or a dog savaging its owner. Many people think that these events occur because of the dogs‚Äô naturally wild behaviours. https://dogtrainingtipssecrets.com/

Good dog!
145k upvotes? At least I was part of some top post.
That smile on the dog in the middel. FANTASTIC
u/raving-wanderlust
I am the luckiest person on Earth. My girl comes to work with me every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
That reminds me.  I need to brush my doggo's teeth.
Don‚Äôt bring her to a Chinese place
Upvote for dogs comment for cats.
What kind of doggo is she OP? I‚Äôd die to keep that pupper face smiling
I read somewhere that owning a dog is worse for the environment than owning an SUV.
 I wish I could upvote this more than once.
We don‚Äôt deserve doggos. What a cutie!

My office had a "bring your dog to work day". I brought my girlfriend to work telling her there was an office party and she was invited.I'm currently single...
We don't deserve dogs.
We don't deserve dogs
Yeah, um, ah, that's not what she's saying.  I know that expression.  She's saying she wants to get the hell out of there RIGHT NOW!
That dog is anxious and possibly scared.  He/she wants out.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good boy but the rest of these guys are fucboi‚Äôs.‚Äù
Crap, this gave me the feels. You‚Äôre so lucky to get love like this.
Find someone who looks at you the way this G O O D E  G I R L E looks at her mother.
these bitches ARE loyal
