He judged the hell out of you and decided you were safe.
You may have saved his little life.
*Moisturize me*
It’s the happy wriggle that does me in.
Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him.  Way to go frog bro.
I thought it couldn't get any cuter ^And ^then ^the ^little ^cutie ^nestled ^right ^in
"I accept your offering. You can now care for me for the rest of your life.""Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!"
This should be in r/HumansBeingBros
You give the frog water to drink. Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives.
When life hands you a tiny swimming pool....
Just have to say that anyone who would notice a random tree frog on a hot day, then go get him a drink, is destined to make the world a better place. Keep up the good work.
Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.
That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!
He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.
It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you.
If I fits, I sits
What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?
Love this post 🙂
Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off.
My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I’m there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot.
Now he won’t croak!
You are a very good human OP!!
I love you OP. ♥️ You just gave that frog the best day of his little life.
Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"😁
You rule
Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond?  Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.
The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.
*wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...
Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clip
This leapt into my heart!
I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy.
Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.
DID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY’S THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little.
I love frogs. They’re so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep.
People like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ❤ we all can learn from that!
Froggo does a soak
My name is FroggI am so hotHere comes a manWhat has he got?It is some waterSo nice and coolI will not drink myNew swimming pool!
He fit perfect in there!
He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him 😊
You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.
In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.
Good on you. But just for reference frogs don’t regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn’t effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel.
I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them
What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!
Tiniest wading pool.

This is one of the cutest “giving an animal water” videos so far. Ahhh so cute
I love frogs so small that their swimming pool is a bottle cap. So cute.
If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?
This is so wholesome.
You’re a damn saint.
Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE
It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.
 congrats on making it to the top posts of all time
So since we’re talking about caring for small animals here I thought I’d bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I’ve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I’m getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over “NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!” They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there’s no animal. It’s just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn’t amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. Welp that’s it
Kind of amazing
Stupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!
I love how he shuffled all the way to the front so it looked like he was resting his chin on the finger :’)
Doing God’s work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you
Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin.
That wiggle😍
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
He *is* drinking while soaking! That’s how frogs do it! You’re a good hooman!
When you come from a long day at work and get in the pool
Omg I love this. Little green frogs are seriously the cutest
Gud freg
"Ahhhhhhhhh, nice." Frog probably.
He just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OP
I love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, “Ugh, don’t fuck with me, it’s too hot.” Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren’t going to kill him.
Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!
/r/HumansBeingBros
That frog looked at the camera/human and was like “are you serious? For me? Okay, don’t mind if I do!”
My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.Nope.This gets my upvote nonetheless.
Quick, sign a contract with him!Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot
You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh.
You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp
 Frogs don’t physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.
He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond.
You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all time
I sent this to four of my friends and their responses were so sweet, they're all 17-19 year old dudes.  "so cute. so fucking cute""THEY BABY""Big fucking moodHe's drinking tho, thas how they do that""happy!!!!!!!!!!"I love my friends
This post is going to be one of the top posts of reddit and i feel so happy because people can learn from it and do the same
Thats how they drink
You know a post is good when it's #1 on r/aww, and has almost 300k upvotes and it's filled vertically

Oh lord that is insanely cute. Well done you.
It rubs the water on its skin so that it rehydrates again
110°??? Why aren't you boiling?!?!
R/humansbeingbros
As soon as he realized it was water, his need for moisture overcame his fear of humans. Such a sweet thing to see. Thank you for being such a kind person and even noticing the plight of such a little creature.
Frogs don’t “drink”, they absorb water through their skin!
amphibians absorb water through their skin so this was the same thing as a drink to him.
This is so fucking cute I actually gasped and made a weird squealing noise... he’s so happy in his tiny little pool 😭😭😭
Frogs can drink though their skin
You're a good person OP. Keep being a bro to all beings big and small
TIL Reddit loves frog.. super cute though
Fun fact: Frogs and toads don’t drink water they absorb it through their skin
That little wiggle after he got in the cap!
Cutest thing I've ever seen P. S.  You guys are nice to help a lil froggie
Wouldn't that be a... full body *croak*? Haha... I'll see myself out...
“Don’t worry froggie, I’ll keep you moist”
Aw little wet froge
We don't deserve frogs...
Imagine being stranded in the desert, and a gigantic hand stretches out of nowhere with a perfectly human-shaped ice cold full bathtub for you.
Its a frog sitting in a bottle cap cooling off! It’s so cute!!!
This is truly r/bettereveryloop
I like how he elegently submerges himself. I was expecting a good ole' belly smacker.
Froggies drink through their skin! So he DID take a drink!

So cute
Hopefully that water wasn't chlorinated
Man, top post of all time!
Technically, he took you up on the offer. Amphibians absorb moisture the their skin instead of physically drinking water. His little scoot in the cap was him maximizing his surface area inside the water. Good job caring for the little guy!

This frog is so cute. The backyard looks heavenly too.
r/soakies
We've been getting a huge heat wave here too, +30's and above, which is crazy hot for where I live.  I never even thought of this but I should probably put large water bowls outside for various animals that may be desperate for water or a place to cool off.
Thank you for helping Frogger 🙂 This video is adorable.
I love how it starts off suspicious, then realizes that there's a nice little pool of water.
I don’t know why but all frogs have an Australian accent in my mind.
Any way this was in Texas? Because we were melting today.
I mean look at the size of the container you offered him! He obviously thought you were offering a bath.If someone pushed a bathtub full of water towards you would you think... oh, a drink?
If i fits, i sits

I want everyone to use the term "froggo" IT'S SO CUTE >_<
Thank you for doing this!! Making the world a better place, one frog at a time :)
frogs skin is permeable to water, his wiggle squat was moistening and drinking though his skin.you did a good deed OP.
For an amphibian, full body soak is a drink. Good on you, kind sir
I think this is my favourite thing ever on Reddit to date!
Awwww that’s adorable
Frogs can drink through their skin so technically it is having a drink
Green boy doin an absorb
So wholesome. I love the way it looks at you like, "what? Really? That's mine? Nice....ahhhhhhhh, refreshing."
Should make a little rock pool in your garden area without pets. If you have frogs its a good sign that you probably have alot of creepy crawlies around that probably need water too. Pot bases are great with a few rocks in them and some fresh water. We do it for all our wildlife in summer! big and small!And i dont like frogs at all! But in the heat im happy to help anything in need!!!
Holy crap, this is currently the second highest voted post on r/aww of all time!
Frogs “drink” through their skin btw. So technically he’s drinking and bathing :D
Many types of frogs drink through their skin and not their mouth as one would think. That is probably why he/she went into the water, to get a drink. Google it. Still extremely adorable. Great post.
Boopity Boop, Bappity Bap, There's a Tree frog in my Bottle Cap. 💓
The heat here has been really intense as well and the poor jackdaws and crows are all panting and look miserable. We saw some grouped around a small, shallow puddle in the road, taking quick sips, so we bought some water on our ice cream run and poured it into their puddle for them.
Wow this became the top post of all time in just 9 hours!
This is very adorable. I truly do love frogs, they’re just so cute. However, I absolutely would have screamed, dropped the cap, and retreated quickly at the moment he looks up. They’re so unpredictable and that’s the one thing that terrifies me about frogs. Face leaping little shits.
Don’t amphibians “drink” through their skin though? Correct me if I’m wrong. Little dude very well may be getting a drink after all.
I wish I had the video still, but I ran into a similar situation in Queensland. This guy was just parked on the bench in like 34 degree heat, tilting his head towards the shower.https://imgur.com/xvJRySB
Interesting. A frog named Heat Index.
He was having a drink, frogs absorb water through their skin!
I mean what do you do when a giant offers your a pool of water?
That’s one of the most adorable things I’ve ever seen. Love.
I officially declare this is the highest upvote post I've ever seen.
who would turn down a free bath?
This now the top post in this sub.Stay cool, froggo.
Don't frogs actually drink through their skin?
Frogs drink by absorbing water through their skin so it did accept your drink of water offer.

Why does OP only have 14k karma when this post hit 235k
frogs drink through their skin.
I think thats how they drink to be honest. The water gets absorbed into their skin and then they lick it off their face... i think.
And Congrats! It’s the top aww post of all time and it’s not even a day old!
Me when someone offers me just a little bit of attention
Love this.
i can't tell you how many times i see a pic or a gif here that i fall in love with and save, which is deleted by the time i want to show it to a friend.  please never delete this, and if you do, please send me the link to the OG. :)i love tree frogs so much (i have two RETFs) and i've been watching this off and on all day.  in fact, today was a pretty shitty day, and every time i needed a little lift, i looped this six or eight times.i cannot even deal with how adorable this is.
imagine getting one of the most upvoted posts in just a day. wow props to you OP.
Your cute science PSA: Frogs do not drink from their mouths like you do. Most absorb water and gasses directly through a thin layer of skin on their belly and pelvic region called the ‘drink patch.’ (I know because I'm a frog scientist)
How does it feel to have a Top 8 of all time post after only a day?
You should that that frog don't drink water like we do ( using mouth) , they absorb water by their skin using  gland called "drinking patch"...So ,in a reality he only accepted your cold drink respectfully
I understand. My wife and I often go far out of our way to help frogs, toads, and turtles. Won't anyone else think of them?
This is the highest upvoted r/aww post! Congrats!
I cannot stop watching this over and over!!  SO CUTE!!!!
My heart..
You should post this on r/awww. So cute
The way it just settles into the water. Ugh
you deserve a special place in heaven sir
holy crap this is now top post on reddit.
Great. He’s gay now.
Wuss Poppin here for the comment
Frogs absorb moisture through their skin rather than drinking it(as do a lot of other amphibians), so it was always going to be both a soak and a drink.
I'm gonna guess that frogs and most other amphibians absorb a lot of water through their skin.
“Could you take me to the nearest pond please?”
Make sure there's no chemicals in that waterCan't have him turning gay
He put his toes in the water, I guess you could say he toad the water...I'll leave now
Got confused for a couple seconds as to why u weren't on fire. G'day from Straya mate

I learned in science class, frogs can stand *any* temperature so long as you slowly increase it over time.
and then the frog pounded 5 bud lights while waiting for mrs frog to come home & playing FIFA
Got that shiver in his little frog balls.
Wow, what a nice & thoughtful gesture! Thanks!
I want a frog now.
Happy frog good hooman
OMG this is just the cutest
Sweet fiddlers frog that’s cute
Awesome!
Been in Tokyo for the past week. Heat index has reached 100-high teens plus us walking EVERYWHERE. I wish I could jump in a cold pool like this little guy and it be socially acceptable.
I’m not sure why but this made me cry :’)
We get very large toads, small orange salamanders, ringneck snakes, garter snakes, and once even a good sized spotted salamander about 8 inches long on my property.  I see them all as beneficial against insects, and they are protected creatures in my yard.  Any specialists in small reptiles and amphibians out there that can tell me what I can do in my yard to help them thrive?
I was going to destroy the planet with nuclear fire until this video was uploaded to my mind. Maybe humans are worth saving after all. Good Human, you are a hero to your people. Rejoice!

I love how he just nestles! It's so cute!!
I am watching this over and over!

Are you keeping him?
I like when he/she gets in and pauses then hunkers down for a good soak. He/she totally trusted you or, perhaps said: “F-it. If you’re going end me, do it while I’m soaking my frog-leather self in this cool pool.”
I can't stop watching this.
God has made beautiful creatures. Both human and animals.
Bless your soul OP
Frogs drink through the pores in their skin so...
"wait, is that water?yeah, it's water... get in it...oh, that's nice...ohhh shiiiiiiitt, that's real nice."
I just imagine him in a British accent saying, "ahhhh that's the ticket"
Arizona summer is a bitch, but Arizona humans are goodbois. - Frog
Where does this frog/op live?
They can drink through their skin if I'm not mistaken. I may have just totally made that shit up....sounds legit tho.
I love how he takes a second to process the situation before saying "fuck it it's too hot, let me cool off in this hooman's water contraption."
a slimy boy is a happy boy. good work op

Imagine being offered a swimming pool of water
Zen moment of the summer
FootloosePickleJuice, you're awesome.  I love it. Nice work.  You're cool (ing), too.
Growing up I would get lots of green tree frogs in the house.  I was always taught to thoroughly wash my hands, rinse all the soap off, and only pick up the frog (to take it outside) with clean, dripping wet hands
Bless you
ok i liv with u now
Would it surprise you if you knew that frogs “drink” through their skin?
He's so tiny that he fully submerged himself into a bottle cap full of water. It's crazy that the bugs he eats are almost the same size as him.
If I fits I sits
He closed his eyes!!
What a sweet gesture! Keep going man.
Now that's some high quality h2o
Poor think looks dry.  He very much appreciated the water.  Cutest thing I've seen in a long time.  Thank you!
Omg, it is sooo tiny
My little swimming pool !!🐸🐸
In this summer heat, it was crazy satisfying watching this froggy jump in that little cap of water. Gracias!
I got heaps of frogs around my place, sometimes they come in under the door and it becomes a race against time to catch them before the cat does. Love frogs.
Sweet buddy!!

Dude amphibians drink through their skin
100k in 4 hours. Wonder what itll be at when i awake
You can lead a horse to water, but you must bring water to a frog🐸
:D
Funny story. Once when I was young a tree frog fell in the boat with me and my dad and he handed it to me. When I was done with it I threw it in the water and he was like “what the hell why would you do that?” I said “he’s a frog” he said “a TREE frog. Not a WATER frog” and I cried cause I thought I drowned a frog.
He’s probably drinking through the “drinking patch” located on the belly and and underside of their thighs. I learned this from Tuck Everlasting
Frogs drink thru their skin... ❤️🐸

It is equally as dry here in the Netherlands. Got seperate waterbowls for hedgehogs, insects and cats and i love watching them being used!

There's something special about the combination of a kind human and an appreciative frog. Didn't know that until now. But definitely special.
So cute! You should put a small dish of water or something out there for him.
What a cutie
Damn, you’re a real homie!
He’s totally smiling at the end <3
I didn't know I needed a frog in my life.
Frogs actually drink by absorbing water through their skin so he did, in fact, take up your offer.
From a frog lover, thank you for this
Don't worry, Froggy. I'll keep you moist.
How did you not keep him??? Omg soo cute
Well this just brightened up my day!
Poor guy
This is so kind ☺️ well done, op
This is a lot more polite than the time I caught a lethargic amphibian in the basement, took it outside while half asleep myself, and put it a little too enthusiastically in the nearby small pond. Tried to help, ended up water boarding. :(
Thank you for taking care for that little frog.
"Mjeh"
That often *is* how many reptiles drink, especially desert reptiles. Water on their body will be drawn to the edges of their mouth via the capillary effect.Think of if you put a paper towel upright in a glass of water. The water will travel up the towel, wetting the portion not in the glass.This be how some frogs and lizards do.
Definitely gonna need more frogs on this sub
Thank u/footloosepicklejuice friend of frogs
I thought it couldn't get any cuter
The part when he hunkers down 😍😭💖
That's how frogs drink
I love nature and wildlife so much. They always surprise you! He wasn't even scared, he knew you were there to help. What a cute little guy =)
That was very nice of you!!  anytime i see a frog or toad in the florida heat I always put them on the edge of the nearest puddle or supply of water because a lot of times they get too far away and bake.
181k upvotes! I never think I seen so many upvotes on a post.

A lot of people say humans as a species should die out, as we are killers and haters, but I disagree.  This video shows what we are; the love we have inside us for everything around us.  If there is even just one person with compassion and the want to help others we have hope and we should survive.
Just realised that this post is the top post of all time. Congratulations OP

207k+ upvotes and 5 gold and is still not enough for how much this little guy deserves.... and the guy who gave him the water too
I just keep rewatching and hearing "Hmm?... Ooo... Ooohhhh mmmmmmm"
OSfrog
210k!? It's been a while since I've seen a post upvoted that high
Lol this is sooooooooooo *COOL* 🤣👌
If I fits, I sits.

The wife hangs these flower baskets on the outside lights at our house every summer. One year, while watering it, I see movement inside, and it turns out a frog decided to make it his/her home. So i cut out the bottom of a cup and filled it with water and placed it nicely inside. The next day, I come out to check on em, and low and behold, he is passed out inside the cup in the water. He stayed around for a good 3 or 4 months before he/she decided to move on.
The way they just shuffled down in the cap a little deeper than when they first got in and just started relaxing was just adorable.
This is the most upvoted thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit, great job!!
I have watched this so many times and I love it
this reminds me of how my dog goes straight for the kiddie pool at the dog park and ignores all the other dogs when its hot out
This post and these comments are so wholesome ☺
Don't they drink through their skin?
Stuff like this makes the struggle to stay vegan worth it.
That's adorable! Made my morning even better! Thank you sir!
Oh my gosh!  Thank you for saving his tiny life!
Great job, frog bro.My house is covered with tree frogs in Savannah.
This is hands down the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Good Karma right there.
Wet boi is super happy
congrats on top of all time on this sub dude!
Good thing you got to him before he croaked.
Did ya at least kiss it?  That one may be a prince.
RIP his inbox
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
I'm French and I like it
Frogs can drink through their skin you saved that dude.
Frog: "Aah! What are you doing?? Wait, is that cold wa- oh, hell yes it is! Okay, don't eat me, I'm getting in. Oh, boy, that is, oh, that's heaven. Yeah. I'm just gonna... settle on in here... rest my little head on your thumb a bit, and.... Yes. All is right in this place."
The new champion of r/aww!!!
That little wiggle after he sat in the water...
Your username kills me....was that a saying you used when you were younger?
Isn't that still a cold drink for amphibians?
Frogs actually drink through their skin! So thats how the little guy goes for a drink 😴
Amazing work there, chap.
I love this so much
how did that cute frog ended so high above the ground?
Congratulations sir you now have the highest upvoted post in this sub. *slow claps*
And just when you thought it couldn't get better,They actually drink with their butts.It's called a seat patch.
Hide a doggie bowl in the flowerbed and you’ll have a friend for life. Just make sure to refill the bowl periodically.
Hey I know him
That's a pretty funny sight! :)First a little bit hesitant, but then it's like... fuck it, too warm to be picky.Got job on helping this little buddy out!
You're a good person, OP.
Is this the most upvoted post of all time?
lol you can see the moment when he's thinking, "yeeeesh!" when he settles in.
Congrats on the most upvoted awww post of all time
This is the best thing I've seen all day!
This should reach 1 million upvotes. It's the post to conquer all posts
Aww ... so precious!  Thank you!
This made me happy
So beyond adorable.
you just saved my life with this video
Hey guys shouldn’t this be the 2nd most upvoted post of all time or am I missing something?
A frog never drinks from his own pool.
We have the same tree frogs around our house and this made me very happy💚
He's never been more thankful for anything!! lmaooo
I love him!
What a precious little guy. Thank you for taking care of him.
You're a very good person.

This currently the second-most upvoted post in all of Reddit history! You only need ~40k more karma to beat the Guardians of the front page.
One small step for frog. One leap for frogkind.

If you didn't help the little fella he might've croaked..
You just made it a little easier to be green :D
How sweet the frog is! It became something more than we expected!
That's awesome!!!
This was only posted six days ago and it's already the fifth most uovoted post of all time.
Wtf that’s soooo hot. It’s never past 41 degrees where I am from.
When God sends one a miracle and you just marinate in it like
I saw a poor local frog had died crossing the trail trying to get to the water.  I am happy to see you are helping your locals...

Why doesn’t this post show at the top of all? It would be the number 1 post

This is SO CUTE.

But did he get 50 dolla.... wait wrong post
I remember when this had only 8 upvotes...
Man, that's hot.
Let me get in the archive 😈😈
A frog would run at my ugly face
this is possibly the cutest thing ever thanks for sharing
I will always love this post.. it is really cute how it just trusted you
He could not resist.
Thank you kind human.
You offered that frog *water*? Like from a toilet?
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day. Thank you.
110°F = 43.33°C
Liar the water would melt if it was 110•
Awww, God Bless your good heart!
Heat index? Is that what they're calling "temperature" where you live?
Awh little frogger boye took a bath.. so cute :’)
For non-Americans that is about 43 Celsius
Tfw celcius. Very cute dog there though
You. I like you.
I hope there aren't any chemicals in this water that turn the freaking frogs gay
Everytime I hit play on something marked as video when I'm in office bathroom, I'm afraid something will shout from the video and make me feel embarassed...
r/humansbeingbros
Frogs also drink with their entire body surface.
Froggie : “GET AWAY FROM ME!! Eh wait..let me just..ooh~ that’s just...oh yeah~”
Top post of all time.
My nem is frogAnd wen it hotWater I wantCan find it notHooman say hereDrink from da lidBut I too warmI sit instead
That's the face kids make when they're peeing in the pool.
Aw, I'm sure the little fella will be eternally grateful to you for saving his life ☺️ My friends and family always make fun of me because I save bugs from drowning in the pool or I put them outside if they're in the house, but they're denizens of the Earth too, little though they may be!
Frogs do not drink like we do; they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. Ps I’m not smart I googled it
I think you may have found a froggo doggo.
This has got to be like 100 times worse than when a cat sits on your lap and you're not allowed to move anymore
Heat Index? Is this an american thing?
Bud...
r/humansbeingbros
You are a awesome human!!!!
You made that frogs day. It’ll be forever grateful.
That’s pretty wholesome right there
Good people.
The little cutie just sat in and looked at you like “you my bitch now”. For real, this is the best thing I’ve seen today!
You saved his life. That's how they absorb oxygen
You are kind. 👍
Just take my upvote, and my heart.
I love him at first sight ... and you for being so sweet to him.   <3

Aren't they cold blooded
You rock!
It was 110° heat index here too. I didn’t soak any frogs.
"you and me are best friends now"Froggo probably

This is the equivalent of your friend asking you for a birdie, and then they proceed to finish most of your drink.
This is so cute I almos my cried
That frog looks so content
This makes me happy!
Look at him!!! I hope he is safe!!
This is so friggen (froggin) cute!!!!

Tiny frog friend! Good on you!

If you give a frog a bath  Then he'll want a massage.
Ahhh yiss, just dis plz
is that a whites tree frog in the wild?
rib-awwyiss-bit.
Thanks I needed this video in my life <3
I love this. He turns around like, “this? for me?”
He owns you now. And he knows it too.
“Thanks man!”
Omg first time ive seen a frog do that so calmly and knowingly. It KNEW you were offering to help it, looked straight up at you and took a chance. This is honestly amazing. And good on you for taking the time out of your day to offer aid to a small critter, clearly it appreciated it. Aaaa this is just so adorable and amazing and ahdjfjkf always makes me wonder what is going through some animals’ heads, like especially for such a tiny frog which are normally skittish.Speaking of frogs, this just made me think of my own [frog story](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/90cn2u/full_story_in_comments_a_very_cold_tree_frog_i/?st=JJTG05I7&sh=e36dedee)
Your small kindness made a big difference to that little guy.
Everyday can be Wednesday when you're this kind
MAH HEART
That's fuckin' adorable.
Thirsty guy
This makes me want to go give that rattlesnake in my backyard some water ❤️
"This is my home now"
Those little tree frogs can make a lotta noise!!
Awwww how kunieee :3
Seeing things like this really makes me love Reddit.
This made my day
Awwwww on behalf of the little frogger thank you!
Good humans.
The little butt wiggle really made this even more adorable.
Adorable !!!!
What is "heat index"?EDIT:  "a quantity expressing the discomfort felt as a result of the combined effects of the temperature and humidity of the air."Google search.
Do you know what kind of tree frog he is? Hes really cute, you probably gave him such a comfy bath.
I love how he doubles down and almost goes “ahhhh yes yes this is perfect, thank you”
This is so pure.
So adorable! Both of you!
“I live here now. Get off my property.”
I love the his further nuzzle into the water!
That's cool as shit
If I remember my highschool Biology correctly, frogs die when their skin loses moisture.
Texas?
My mum always left a bowl of water out for frogs.
“ok human, now put me in some shade.”
Aww yiss
Love it!We had to get one of those animal bridges for frogs and ducks to get out of our in ground pool. We had a baby duck go for a cool off with mom and get stuck. Once we got him out we figured it was a good idea. It has also turned into the entrance/exit/sunspot for various lizards.
He seems too cute to not be poisonous.
When I was a kid my grandma put my pet frogs in the sun because they looked cold :(
Sitting like a prince on his throne.
Awwwwww. I get a shit ton of those frogs coming out of my unused pool each year. They’re sooo cute
goes. Must have found you absolutely ribbeting
Precious. I love this thirsty boi
“I am yours now.”
He decided this human was a friend pretty quickly lol
Cuteness Overdrive!
Aw cute little guy:)
Keeping your new adorable little friend?
How can he have 9000 + kharma and this post got 32000 + upvotes 🤔
Thank for this! Made my day!
Great. Now he's gay.
How do I upvote this more than once?

Accidental awesome. The best.
Haha pretty cute
Sick frog
Now you may kiss the frog!
that makes more sense.  hes/shes not a dog.  his/her skin has special protective properties so maintaining a hydrated skin is a survival tactic.
This silly behavior is why I love frogs and toads. They're so chill, and I really feel like they understand humans better than most other creatures- at least when it comes to our intentions with acts of kindness like this.I've never met a scared or nervous frog/toad.
This made my night. I love seeing my fellow humans helping a more vulnerable species.

So trusting!
I want him/her, what an amazing creature!
He’s like..water! That’s my thing!
Did he give you a quest? (I'm sure that jokes been made, just playing it safe)
I want to give animals water tomorrow.

Was dis? Yusssssss.
Soooo cute!
WOW
That little frog prince purified himself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
If I fits, I sits.
That was quite an act of trust.  Also, you must have good water where you live.
My niece has discovered a few little tiny skinks living around a rock wall in her backyard.  She's upset that it is so hot outside so I promised her I'd help her make them a little minipond this weekend so they can "Netflix and chill" (her words...yes we are positive that she has no idea what this means and is just repeating things she's heard on TV.  Yes we lol about this).  So what do?  I was thinking of using this old white dogfood dish the previous tennants left in the garage.  Throw a few rocks in there, fill with water and tuck it into a shady corner of the wall.  Will that be beneficial?  Will they even care?
That’s how they drink. They drink through their skin.
This wins the Internet.
He looks so happy!!
Lil ribbet needs the wet
Frogs actually drink and breathe through their skin!
This video is life

this is the kind of thing that makes me wonder if animals can recognize human intention. like, he was in OP's fingertips the whole time, and he decided to go for it anyways, knowing OP was being nice.

God this is so wholesome❤️
Now I'm depressed about the frogs that didn't get the luxury of a water bath.

Nicely done. I find these frogs dead all the time in the city. Usually appears like they roasted on pavement. That’d be a bad way to go

I have a serious phobia of frogs, but this was cute as shit.

Weird name for an animal.
imagine a giant alien 1000 times your size and weight approached you with a tub of water, would you just jump in it? 🤔
We must be gods to them.
Same.
Very cute! When we were kids my bro n a cousin n myself, we used to go to a creek that ran thru our small town. We would catch little frogs n some other creature n take them to our little clubhouse in our backyard. The guys would dissect them n I guess threw them away. (I was 8 then n didn't understand why they did that) I was excited to be able to hang out with the guys!
This is just the cutest darn thing I've seen
AWWWWWW YISSSS
Aww!! did you guys bring him home? look after it for the summer?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't frogs absorb water through their skin. So technically hes "drinking ", right?
It's not easy being green
Yes, because frogs drink through their skin. Good thing he knows that sort of thing. Cute little guy, and so nice of you to cool him off! More people should be nice to animals. :)
Jumpo doggo water sit
PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS
And as an European person, i thought you"d make steamed food. Damn Führerheits.

That readjustment is absurdly cute.
This is the single greatest frog-related thing I have ever seen.
Did you try kissing it?
Is the heat index an accurate measure frogs? Wouldn't humid heat be less of a problem for them? I'm not trying to be clever, just genuinely curious.
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week. Ty!

One of the pro's of being tiny. You don't need much water to get soaked. ;)
You probably saved that little guy's life.
That is cool, but the chlorine in tap water is bad for amphibians. Not as bad as dehydration, though.
What happened after ? Did you take it in and keep it ? I HAVE QUESTIONS !
Wtf..... Welcome to the top post of r/aww. Congrats man! And very cute frog lol
I kill flies and ants (if they get inside my house) but go out of my way to save any type of bee where ever they are.... balanced?
Why would anyone downvote this lmao
Good deed doer.
This is nice quality video, what phone did you use?
Where's Toad?
This made me very happy
-2°C over here
And they say small plastic caps are better for the environment.
This is one of the cutest “giving an animal water” videos so far. Ahhh so cute
I would want to have kept him!!!
He’s so cute
That little wiggle tho
awwww that frog went from lholy shit humans!" to "really? thanks man"
Awesome!
He is now your familiar. Take good care of him.

Don’t judge him for drinking up the butt.
Gave him a little swimming pool lol
Amphibians, in particular frogs, absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The drinking patch is located under their belly and thighs, which explain the “full body soak” in the gif.
You from OK?
I love these friggin creatures
It is wetnessday my dudes!
That’s how they drink: they absorb it through their skin.
Doing things like this is under appreciated.
It is hot out there, my dudes.
This summer, I've been seeing an unusual number of dried up, tiny dead frogs on the concrete paths that circuit the park I take my dog to for his walks. So seeing this is timely.   (\^\^)ｂ

Now go and tell the frog he has 136k upvotes on reddit.
EVOLUTIONARY CRIME! SELECTION INTERFERENCE! SELECTION INTERFERENCE!
Why don’t you carry the frog to the nearest body of fresh water and put him in? How does a frog get so far from water anyway?
he’s so skinny
Nice save
Ribbeting stuff
This baby can take temperatures up to 10,000 degrees!
I found an injured, and probably dying crow on my front steps on July 4th. I knew there was nothing I could do to help the poor fella, so I let him be on the front steps (the alternative would have probably been to forcefully get him off the stairs). I also gave him a bowl of water. That crow might not have been able to get off the step, but he sure enjoyed crawling into the water. The next morning he was gone. In my mind's narrative, he got better and flew away. In reality, he probably died during the night and got carried away by a raccoon or cat or something.
You in texas?
So cute
Plot twist: actually a full size frog.
Kiss the frog!
Don't they drink through their skin?
I want a pet frog now 🐸
very hot here. this video is so cold \~

That’s how frogs drink, they soak it through their bodies
I can't believe there are frogs that tiny!  It's good of you to offer some water.
Most interesting proposal ever.

Frogs need to keep their skin hydrated so they can breathe, you know.

Any frog above ground at 110f here is a crisp in 5 minutes. The concrete is searing hot to touch. Is it really 110 there? Birds sit in the shade with wings half open and mouths agape. Most people stay inside.

Those things are so cool, I used to own a couple of them.

Aren’t they poisonous ☠️??
My mom's boss was going through some personal problems and had to get rid of his dog. My mom said she would baby sit till he got everything in order. Mom had a car accident not long after and could not work anymore. Her boss moved to another state to take care of one of his kids. 5 years goes by and he comes into town for court with his ex wife. His dog went ape shit when she heard his voice. Dog was crying tears, barking like crazy, and running in circles around him.    We ended up baby sitting the dog for 12 years. She died at 18, but any time he came over, you could tell she was always his dog.
Who steals a dog?
"He does that to everybody" ...man, the things people will say in court....

Stolen dog [reunited after 2 years.](http://i.imgur.com/EvlwRe8.gifv)
"he does that to everybody"theres so many people in that room and he chose the owner, wtf are you talking about??
my girlfriend found a dog awhile back and tried to find an owner but no one called back to the signs. she didn't check for a chip because he was pretty haggard looking and she didn't have time to take him to the vet. fast forward to a few months later and she takes him into the vet for a check up and just as a joke checks for a chip and what do you know, he has one. perks up to his old name and she took him to his owner that night, her family was ecstatic and thought he was long gone. i miss that little dog but i am glad he's back with his original family.
TF did the thieves think was gonna happen once they had to bring the dog in?Edit: Apparently they didn't steal it; they bought it in front of a mall. In any case, they shouldn't have tried to keep it once they found out it had a proper owner.
[deleted]
[deleted]
They should have had a neutral person bring the dog in, and have each person just stand there and then see. Edit: Oh wow this was after 2 years. Definitely his dogEdit2: Just saw the video of the case and it was actually just 5 months. By the time they got on the show it was 6 or 7 months total

Judge Judy is a pretty cool dude.
I'm over here nearly crying over a Judge Judy clip. Damn.
And the wise judge spoke 'Cut the dog in half'
It's a good thing my dog is registered to me and I have proof that he's been mine since he was 8 weeks old.Because *he* really does do this with everybody.
Open and shut case, justice served!

If there's any question why Judge Judy makes so much money - she's the shit

You can tell it's the *smell* that gets the recognition.
It's always incredibly sweet to see a big man loving his tiny prissy pup.

Someone tried to steal my puppy at the airport when I was 3 right before Christmas. The airport said he had arrived but he was missing and now they couldn't find him. He was only a few months old and a dalmatian in peak 101 dalmatian times so my dad suspected something was up. He wanted them to look harder, so he told ME, the exhausted 3 year old missing her dog, that someone had lost my puppy...right in front of customer service to intentionally make a scene.Anyway, he mysteriously turned up not long after I started screaming. He was found in a room he shouldn't have been in, back in a maze of offices. My parents swear someone was trying to take him for a Christmas present, but it ended with a happy reunion and 12 more years of walks <3
This is too pure for reddit

Yeah, when you start crying from holding a dog, it's your fuckin dog.
I remember an old man tried to steal our dog, despite him being collared. Luckily we were able to convince the man to give him back without getting the authorities involved.People who steal dogs are sick.
Congrats, you just made a 6'8" tall man cry happy tears.
Case solved, love that judge.
I love how sick of this shit Judy is."It's his dog. That's all, take the dog home"
Judge Judy is a G... My girlfriend bartends a few daytime shifts a week and always has Judy playing in the background. She's a mega fan. She even dressed up as her for Halloween. I wrote the production company and sent her a pic of my girlfriend in costume and she sent me back an autographed headshot written specifically to my gf. Gf cried. Judge Judy got me some serious cred. JUDY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.
"Court room"..."Judge Judy"Not what I was expecting.
Realistically the only fair way to settle such a dispute is by cutting the dog in half and letting them both have a piece.
Here, it was obvious to everyone the dog was his, but Judge Judy really does have an awesome BS detector. I both fear and love that woman.

Air bud irl.
I want to be clear that she didn't say "Would you pick him up." She said, "You can pick him up." She knows how much this dog loves him and how much he loves that dog. There was no hesitation of a doubt and I find that beautiful. And kudos for the guy for having restraint to not just lose it right there
Feels like this could also go well in /r/justiceporn.

"Listen to me carefully. Cut the dog in half.""Mmhmm. We both get part that way.""WHAT!? NO!! NOT FLUFFLES! Let her have him. As long as he's alive and happy.""It's his dog.""Oh he says that to everybody.""It's his dog."
I'm unreasonably angry after "he does that to everybody"And I'm like... biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I'm not crying, *you're* crying.
Background info:The lady had purchased the dog for $50 6 months ago with little suspicion as the "owner" wanted to get rid of it cause it was incompatible with their other dog.The actual owner found out about it 3 months later and request the return.The conflict comes from when the woman didn't believe (or didn't want to believe) that this was not her dog.TL:DR neither person was at fault and the real asshole was the one who stole the dog to sell for a quick buck causing both sides to feel emotional turmoil... supposedly.
I wish Judge Judy would run for president. I trust her.
"No your honor, you don't understand. This dog is a total slut! They'll accept pettings from anyone!"
And then you remember judge judy is fake af anyway
This is why you microchip your pets.

Judge Judy, for all the pageantry, is a badass. Good on her.
here's the episodehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0a6Oy7rfAand here's the commentary he said/she said at the endhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g&t=1m49s
Sad story:When I was 9, my dog was stolen from my garage, a small terrier.Six months later, he was at my doorstep waiting for me.I was overjoyed. He was filthy, washed him, cut his hair, combed him all night and when I woke up, the side door was broken down again into the garage.My dog was stolen again.
This made me cry! Good call, Judge Judy. <3
Amazing that the Judge Judy serious stare directly translates to: youfuckingassholebitchareyououtofyourgoddamnedmindbringingthisfuckingbullshitgarbageinmyfuckingcourtoflaw Language fascinates me
"it's his dog." case dismissed immediately! LOL
That was so satisfying to watch. Judge Judy is the bomb.
"He does that to everybody."Lol! Funny, he didn't do that to every other person in the court room.
Take my children, fine. Take my dog, I'll kill myself
What did we do to deserve dogs?
You can't say dogs do that to everyone. Kidding me? That was a reaction of a dog seeing someone he knew and loves.
"He does that to everyone." Not exactly
I think that's the brother or some other close relative of my parents' moving guy. I had just taken the bar exam that morning and he told me about him appearing on that show to recover a stolen dog. Neat to see the video!
Lol it's kind of funny that a big black dude has a tiny little dog lol.
This is my biggest fear. I adopted my dog two years ago from the Humane Society and I am terrified one day we're going to be walking down the street and he's going to lose his shit seeing someone.

Bichons are the most loving breed. They get attached to a person very easily. He may have liked the lady, but it would have never been the same as his daddy.
My puppy greets me like this everyday, and only follows me.  Dogs know their true friends.
"That's him! He's the one who said I was best doggo!"
That woman felt the full force of the paw.
I just watched this episode this morning. Basically the Plaintiff (the guy who owns the dog) is suing the Defendant for stealing the dog, when the defendant claims she bought it for $50. So this happens.Wholesome case altogether
source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6gYeah that dog reacted that way after like 8 months away and you can hear the mom saying "don't. don't. don't." as she's putting the dog down.  They knew damn well that was his dog.   The mom tried to say she recently bought the dog, bs.
Yaaaaaas I love judge Judy. Also the moment when the dog and his owner make eye contact 😭
I gotta say, despite the fact that reality shows are scripted, and hers probably just as much, I think Judy Scheindlin is one of the best celebrities out there.She actually practiced law, she doesn't take bull (how she acts in the show is how she acts in real life, though maybe toned down a bit) and the show is meant to get people to do the right thing. She's someone people can actually look up to

"Court room"
When I was younger, my cat went missing. I was pretty upset and searched/put out signs but didn't find her. A few years later, my vet called - a lady brought in a cat she found as a stray (a few towns over) and my vet recognized my cat. The lady told me all about the adventures they had while waiting to find her "mom" and was happy to return her to me. I offered to work to pay her back the vet bills she had but she said no, it was enough that she found the owners and got to return her. I always thought that was the sweetest thing a person could do for a young kid. I was so happy to have my cat back. :)
I had one of my dogs stolen out of our front yard. Apparently this 20 something dumbass and his girlfriend decided to pick him up and tried to give it to his dad as a present. Thankfully, his dad was sensible and called the number on his collar to return the him. Not the first time either. A few years ago, someone stole my puppy out of our front yard too. People suck.
I went on a week long backpacking trip and they only thing I could think about was getting back to my dog. I had not even a foot in the door when my sweet boy ran over and jumped in my arms freaking out and super happy to see me. I was crying so hard because I was happy to see him. I really relate to this guy crying at holding his dog again.
This almost made me cry, i haven't cried since my little han got murdered .
"He does that to everybody" what a pathetic excuse 😂😂
Every morning Trump wants a binder full of things people like about him.Every morning I'd like a binder full of gifs like this, where good shit's happening to folks all over the daggun place.
I own this breed of dog. There's no way that dude isn't the dogs owner. These dogs are sweet and friendly, but they only act like that with 'their' person. My own husband doesn't get that kind of love from my dog. Even if she hadn't seen him in a really long time. These dogs are perfectly nice and love people, they'll let anyone pet them. (Even my girl who is scared of everything.) But this amount of excitement is reserved for that one person that they've adopted.
"He does that to everybody"He's not doing it to you, is he?
This is beautiful.
Judge Judy is awful but was right here.

If someone tried to steal my dog they wouldn't have made it to Judge Judy.

I wonder what that case was about?
Judge Judy's one weak spot is dogs lol. But she also has a keen eye for dogs. Some may be fooled, but Judge Judy isn't. She's a smart cookie!
I love that the judge bases who should get the pet based on how the pet is happy to see the owner, this is totally how it should always happen.  Seen a few other instances of this before too (think it was also Judge Judy). I guess that would work ok for dogs, but not cats, because cats DGAF. lol.
Best thing I've seen all day
"He does that to everybody"The dog hadn't ran to the audience members, though...
If someone was selling a dog outside of a mall for $40 I'd find that sketchy as hell. She should have known better.
I had to leave my doggo with family when I moved abroad. But every time I come to visit he ignores everyone else and zeroes in on me. Doggo doesn't forget, doggo loves forever.
Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g sidenote: I've been watching judge judy cllips for like 45 minutes since seeing this what have you done to me.
I think this is my favorite gif ever
Some months ago I saw what she earns per year. I figured it would be like $5 or 10 million a year, but she gets [$47 million a season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Sheindlin). Not only that, she is the highest paid tv personality.

This is a straight up Pixar movie.
"He does that to everyone."Give me a break.Anyone that owns a dog knows the difference between a Good Boy greeting their owner, and a Good Boy playing with/asking for scratches from a random person, even if it's the most social Good Boy in the world. The tail wag is completely different. The whine is sadder (like they haven't seen you in a century, even though you just went to the cornerstore to get a carton of milk). They're way more jittery (like they snorted a line of coke). etc.That dude definitely owns that dog. 100%.
Cotdam! I just woke up, you can't make me cry like that already
I fucking love Judge Judy 😂
One of the greatest things I have ever seen on the internet.
"He does that to everybody"
Not even 24 hours and one of the most liked posts ever
always chip your furbaby
Yay!!!!   Justice has been served...
The uproots are rising faster than the guardians of the front page
Anyone else find this super fake?
This is love..
[removed]
What a piece of shit that women is. That guy cares more about his dog than most 5 year olds.
someone who steals someone's dog should be someone who no longer exists on this planet. Just pure evil.
Case dismissed. Bring in the dancin lobstas
Isn't this shit fake?
Yes, some dogs act excited around strangers.No dog, ever in the history of dogs has ever acted that way towards someone they didn't intimately know. As-in: A member of their pack.Dogs olfactory systems are the largest and most complex databases in nature. They can remember a person's scent decades after having seen them last. It is how they are able to find their way back to original homesteads after not being there for years. (They often do this when they sense they are dying.)Those women are thieving liars, and I hope they get eaten by bears.
"He does that to everybody" yeah, my ass.
I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that my dog gets ridiculously overexcited when friends and relatives visit, but is pretty chill greeting me when she doesn't see me for a few days. I'm old news.
Totally cried.
Is Judge Judy even real? I thought everything except sports (and even sometimes sports) are scripted.This is like Air Bud irl or something.
In the YouTube video you can hear the lady saying "don't, don't, don't" when judge Judy asks to put the dog down. What a scumbag.
That lady thief is poison.   A real piece of sh*t to stand in a court of law and lie like it was breathing.  Either mentally ill or just poison.  Do they fine the looser or put them in prison ?
yeah that is not a court room
Is this fake? A setup for the show? Or it really happened?Edit: Seriously, I am not familiar with this kind of show, and curiously asked a question. Was that offensive or so dumb that deserves downvotes?
Just like the script writers wrote it!
"lost"
The two women need to be slapped repeatedly for being so ignorant.
That's great the dog was returned safe!
This is the first time I have completely agreed w Judge Judy 100% and would of done exactly the same thing. Watch the YouTube link above to get more of the picture.
Judge Judy rocks!!!
Oh judge Judy. This must be the best episode of that entire show.Her net worth is over $300 MILLION.
If you want a dog there are so many who need a loving home. People who steal dogs are assholes. I know my dog and I would claw through hell to get to each other if we were kept apart. And that poor man was crying! Judge Judy thank you.
love judge judy for her bitchiness,   it's great.    She is a dog lover,   obviously.   The only thing in her pantry in NYC is dog food,   hilarious.   I just hate how she doesn't understand how to judge certain cases,    which is odd since she has the experience.   I noticed this in abuse cases and a few others --  she simply has never experienced it and doesn't understand that people rarely report abuse for various reasons.  Well known to most.   I realize she needs evidence,   and in this case saw it plainly....I think....but she is irrational and uninformed at times.   Still love her!

Judge Judy's the fuckin bomb.
Not to bust anyones balls in this, because it seems to me the guy really loves the dog, so I'm happy he gets it. But my moms dog will go apeshit the first 2 minutes of seeing me whenever I visit. Anyone she remotely recognize she will absolutely freak out over seeing. So it may just be that inital 2 minute spaz-out. Not that the dog doesn't love the guy, but if the roles were reversed and the guy had been with the dog all day and it hadn't seen the woman for a while, it might be just as happy to see her too.
What kind of terrible person would keep a dog from its owner
I mean this is cute and all but some dogs will do that to everyone.  I work at an animal shelter and we hold the strays from our county.  When a person come to claim a dog we require proof (vet records, pictures) and some people will say "just let the dog see me and you'll know it's mine."  That may be true but it's certainly not hardcore enough proof to send the dog home with that person.  People try to claim/steal small cute dogs a lot.
This reminds me of a r/thathappened post come to life: "the dog jumped out of her arms and ran to me.....everybody clapped"
you could show this in any country with no words, no sounds and every person would know exactly whats going on here.
That was awesome! Lol. That lady has some nerve.
I did not think it was possible to love Judge Judy even more.
What kind of sicko would steal someone's dog? It's cruel to the person and the dog. Just get your own dog, they practically give them away at shelters.
rrfgg QQ Xmas dgv
Gotta love meat-scented cologne. Jk, I fucking love that he got his dog back.
Step 1: Sell dog to Woman for $50 outside a mall.Step 2: Take buyer to TV court.Step 3: Repeat.
If you could hear it all, when Judge Judy tells the lady to put the dog down the defendant keeps telling  her not to. She knew..
I love that judge so damn much. She's not only a model judge but a model woman.
One of the fastest court session I ever seen
[Real Life Air Bud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HmuM48Cb8)
IM THE BOSS APPLESAUCE !
Was the case for the dog or did the dog just happen to be there? I assume it's for the dog, hopefully the man has his dog now.
"court room"
This is what it feels like when I pick my son up from his mom's house for my weeks.
Fuck those two women.  I hope they're infertile.
Judge Judy is a savage
Well I'm crying now
That's a wise Solomon sort of ruling.
Judge Judy aint no fool, clearly shes owned a dog once or twice.  Justice is served with kibble this day.
Nature for the win
Who the fuck are those people trying to say that's not his dog!?
I love Judge Judy
crying
Man tear
I teared up
Fake or not, this is awwww-some.
 I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying.
Awesome!
I thought this show was bullshit.
I know judge Judy is "scripted" but I'm glad that dude got his dog back. People who steal dogs are some of the worst scum known to man.
Judge Judy should be on the Supreme Court.
"That's all, take the dog home." -Judge Judy with the mic drop
My roommate has a dog and while she's 100% his, she's like 90% mine too. If that makes sense. She'd be happy if my roommate left and couldn't take her and I became her owner. But she's 100% his if we're both in the same room. Until she figures out the perfect spot so we can both pet her.
Judge Judy is the one celebrity I underestimated their net worth by the most, she makes so much from sick kids staying home and moms
I literally just watched this on YouTube. Creepy.
So cute
I had a pet cougar that greeted everyone the same.
Those are terrible f'n people. I am glad that man and his dog are reunited. 🐕♥️
Judy da BOSS
Are real cases presented in these shows? I've heard it's either fake, or people in show bring cases that they couldn't afford to go through real courts for.
Not gonna lie, this made me tear up 😢 so beautiful ♥️♥️♥️
This made me so happy I just can't even handle it
Judge judy is the shit. She doesnt fuck around with your bullshit
I'm sorry, "courtroom?"
I mean props for them for taking the legal course but if for some reason the court ruled in their favor I'd just steal my dog back.  No way in hell I'd take that lying down.
Plot twist - his pockets were full of treats.
Fuck those dog stealing birches Edit: Stupid autocorrect. BITCHES
JJ is a dog lover and she knew right away, she won't waste her time on BS
He wanted the cookie in his pocket.

Next time just call the Paw lice... I should end myself
I hate when I'm on the same side as judge Judy....
I feel really bad for that poor dog. Being stolen and sold. Good thing he is with his rightful owner now.
Love this! Fuck that lady
I'm glad judge Judy didn't "king Solomon" the dog.
I always liked judge Judy, even though she is a judge who makes money for berating people she tells it like it is. Also she doesn't tolerate people's bullshit and is extremely non biased...people may disagree but hell if I was her age I'd be like " that's a kind of woman I'd want to call me on my bullshit" and tells me when my shit stinks, literally and figuratively.
That's some Air Bud shit right there. RIP
This is easily my favorite thing on the internet. The joy that dog had of finding his long lost friend is infectious. And the short shot of the guy holding back tears.... C'mon!!
I have a question,  i dont watch television especially not American, are these types of shows authentic? Is that a real judge doing actual law cases? Or is it staged performance replicating real court cases?
I'm crying, people.
This is beautiful.
Omg this is so cute!
Didn't plan on crying again tonight... :')
Nice! I think I remember this one. Good to see an ending like this one.
Dog thieves are such horrible human beings wow
"court room" . . . tv set> retired Manhattan family court judge. The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claim disputes within a _simulated courtroom set_. All parties involved must sign contracts agreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin.While they do sign contracts for arbitration she isn't a judge anymore so her "rulings" aren't final say and anything she "rules" on is possible to be taken further in an actual court.
Real life Air Bud
There should be montages of the stupidest shit people say on Judge Judy.
I remember this case very clearly (defendant won't return dog she claimed she rescued because it's now part of her family, real owner sues to get dog back) and now I can re-watch / get good feels whenever I want. Thanks, OP.
God dammit, dogs are the best!!!
If someone stole my pet, we'd be in front of a criminal judge because I'd either beat the shit out of the them or kill them. Don't mess with my pets. That's like messing with someone's kids.
It's like Air Bud!
"Courtroom"
Its fake tv
Isn't this show staged? Or just dumb reenactments? I always assumed Judge Judy is a judge like Dr. Phil is a psychiatrist..I haven't owned cable in a decade. .
 I've watched this like 10 times already it's so good lol
Judge Judy is the law.
This dog looks so much like my dog that passed away last year...i miss her so much...what I wouldn't do to have her run at me like that again...
I'm not crying..... YOU'RE CRYING!!
Who's cutting onions this time of night?
Boy if anyone ever tries to steal my dog they won't make it to court.
Give him his bloody dog back you thief!
So precious, glad they got reunited.

Love Judge Judy walks off and says it's over.
"here's another quick mystery"
I've never heard of anyone being able to fake that reaction from a dog. I don't know all dogs, of course.
3000th commentI'm happy that the dog is happy
What a cute little doggy! I love Judge Judy, she's wonderful!
Ah, thanks for being an animal lover judge Judy.
Wait, is this court TV stuff actually real? Haven't watched it in like 10 years
What episode is this?
Man this clip would be so much better if judge Judy didn't have a show and successful career
I'm not crying... my eyes are just leaking!
Awwwww
So cute
If someone tried to steal my dog I might be spending a few nights in jail because I would probably flip out on someone and pound their head in.
Good job! I'm so happy for that guy!
I'm digging the good moments we've been getting from Judge Judy content. But was it just me? I hated this lady when she was on TV. Is she still on TV? Anyways, she annoyed the hell out of me, just wondering if I was the only one.
I literally can't stop watching this. That dog is great. stopstealingdogs/10 Will crie again

Awwww little pupper 😭💕💕💕💕
Ahm..  you know these are fake, don't you?
Ugh Murica things
"Take the dog home" queen Judy
Just watched this on YouTube and I just cried so hard.
This is awesome!
Sitting on the toilet, crying. Thanks Reddit. You always know just how to push my buttons.
Okay..  It made me cry
Awwwe that dude was so happy
I'm sold
This is my favorite Reddit video so far (this week). I get tears every time I watch.
I had that happen... Dog showed up at my apartment on the 4th of July. Walked right in and sat in the kitchen looking all sad.I got her on the porch and took her picture, put her on Craigslist.Guy emails me says "That's my dog!" So I go on the porch and call her by name, no response. OK, cool. I tell the guy "Look, you're welcome to come take a look, but don't get your hopes up because she's not answering to that name..."Dude doesn't have a car so he calls a buddy with this beat up old pickup truck.Now the whole time I'm sitting with her to make sure she doesn't run off and she's hanging her head like the world ended.Then she hears this guy's truck and goes RUNNING down the stairs jumping and barking.Yeah, man, that's your dog.
Why can't people just be honest? Do you really like a dog you barely know enough to lie to the owners face who you know LOVES that dog?  I can't imagine taking my new puppy and telling me that it now belongs to them and then have them lie about why puppy is sleeping on my foot? (it's weird but my puppy loves feet.)
Is there another time where judge Judy is any more fuckin awesome.
This belongs in r/landslidevictory if there is such a thing!
I watched this so much. I couldn't imagine someone trying to keep me away from my family member like that. Way to go J.J.
While watching Judge Judy was fun, it made me realize that no amount of education can benefit stupid people, and that they outnumber smart people 10,000 to 1.
Judge Judy is such a badass.
I had to punch a fucking wall to feel manly again﻿
In all fairness, dogs will do this to "everybody they know well". When my parents come visit, my dog goes nuts to see my dad. She goes equally nuts when either of my brothers comes visit.I am 100% certain under the same circumstances if they hadn't seen either of them in 2 years, and I walked her into a courtroom in the same fashion, she would immediately gravitate to them wanting to see them and lick them.Does that mean shes not my dog?
What kind of vile sack of shit steals someones dog.
"court room"
"It's his dog" You fucking go Judge Judy
All in the day and life of judge Judy.
I was like damn this only got 110 upvotes? Didn't notice the K at the end. Definitely wholesome AF.
"Then why didn't he do it to you."
"Courtroom"
Used to have that kind of dog.  Love them.

*guy slips dog a fiver under the table*you did good kid
That is the cutest thing in the history of this subreddit maybe ever.

Man, that makes me wanna cry,
I imagine he was reading a newspaper, he put it down temporarily, his glasses slid down the slope of his nose a bit so he could look you straight in the eye without a piece of glass in the way. He delivered the line, pushed his glasses back up, and then leaned back and continued reading the paper.
The fuck's that dog doing in a court room anyway? Only in America.
This is like that old story where pre presidential Abe Lincoln was a judge and was meant to decide who was the owner of a horse that was supposedly stolen and he did it by standing both of the involved parties on either end of a field and the idea was the horse would go to its owner so the horse ran to the guy and Abe Lincoln was like "it's his dog". Please tell me I'm not the only one that's heard that story ._.
Also that's not a courtroom.
My cats are like this.They go absolutely ape when then they see my wife and I and they couldn't give a fuck about anyone else.They escort me to my car every morning and meet me most nights on the street when I get home.*edit* words are hard.
Where are my testicles Summer?
This made me cry
The moment of recognition. Be still, my poor doggie heart!
And what weird sob story is this about the woman's mom being over sixty and having her first pet? She is young, she can pick up a good, loving dog from the shelter!
Not only is he the owner, he's probably a very good owner. Makes the dog so happy just to see him!
How sweet loves him toPieces
We never leave our dogs outside unattended. They are always on leashes or contained in the backyard. We have them microchipped as well just to be safe.
Never cried at a gif before. I am weak and pathetic
...And now I'm crying over Judge Judy
If this was a cat, it'd ignore you on purpose
First time I've cried watching a judge Judy clip
NOT A COURT ROOM!!!!
L O Y A L     B O Y E
The dog will surely recognize his owner. First is the owner's smell and then the owners voice.
Cute but so clearly staged.
...in "court room."
Love how the case is immediately settled after that.
My friend found a jack russell/chiuauau dog roaming the streets 6months ago. We put it all over the internet, lost and found groups but no owner came forward.  I have the dog now and it is like my 4th child. I feel bad for whoever lost their dog and it would be tough for me to give her up if anyone ever responded to the posts. Not sure what I would do. My kids love this dog too. Her name is Valentine brought her home on Valentine's day. http://imgur.com/2ZSzC1Y
dog teach you about loyalty and love
I don't know the context at all, and I think it's pretty clear the dog is his since he seems a lot more emotional about it than those girls. However my dogs both go ape shit like that every time they recognize someone as well. They more or less molest each of my friends when they visit.
Cut the dog in half!
The dog definitely belongs to the man!! Glad he got his baby back!!
This made me very happy 😊 don't steal other people's dogs ya hoe
TIL if I ever lose my dog I have to bring my fiancé to court with me because for some reason my dog hates me
What a charade.There's a lesson here - when something hits us in the feels - we forget to think.(not saying the dog isn't his - just that this is staged from beginning to end).
That's a man who loves his dog. Shit I'm at work and miss my dog now. 🐕
Judge Judy fucking rocks
Wish the dog had bit that woman
This is the most upvoted post i have ever seen
Can I please up-vote this twice
I can't believe I'm crying this much over a 10 seconds gif
judge judy takes no bullshit. love how she never hands out pussy passes.
Dogs do not lie!
I feel like she's done with everybody's bullshit and just already knows who would win the case
Titus Andromedon
You have to be a special breed of asshole to steal a dog or any other pet from someone.(Granted idk the exact context of the episode)
Aw, that man is so happy to get his doggy back. Big guys with little dogs make me feel warm and fuzzy.
This is why we need to chip our pets. So no one steals them from us.
And this was the day  The dog who knew 'sit' and 'stay'  Got to learn:  'Hearsay'
Incoming top reddit post of all time! The gif is a karma magnet of the gods.
That warmed my heart. My coworker is dealing with a rough (no pun intended) situation where he let a well reviewed and respected trainer take his dog and the trainer "lost" him. After finding some evidence including surveillance and multiple lies/stories not matching up he suspects the guy stole his dog, sold it or did something to it and is lying. Wish this was the outcome for my coworker instead.
So me and an ex girlfriend split up and she kept the Maltese I bought her. After about 2 months she couldn't take care of the dog as often so my mom and her would split custody. I couldn't since my new apartment doesn't allow dogs. I goto moms about once every other week and that dog loves my mother to death. Once I walk in the house though it forgets all about her and goes apeshit over me.Here's the kicker if my uncle visits (and he visits once a month) and I'm at moms the dog will go crazy for my uncle and forget about me. I'd bet if my uncle was in the courtroom and my ex who has spent way more time with the dog walked in the court the same situation would've happened.
If the dog sits, you must acquit
Stolen dog*
I truly can't think of anything I've seen on Reddit that I've loved more than this.
u/maxexodus look at this cute fucking shit
Hell yeah Judge Judy.
My doggo ran away about a year ago. She was missing for close to a week. One day we got a call from the vet saying someone brought her in and they scanned her microchip etc etc. Luckily she was fine, the people who had picked her up lived in a big house with a huge yard and two bulldogs, they said they really loved her and if we wanted to sell her they would love to buy her. Of course we declined that offer super fast and brought her back home ASAP.
That's a true dog owner, you can see the love in his eye
Is someone in here cutting onions?
As someone who had the ex take my dog, I find this deeply satisfying.
"I'm taking the dog, dumbass"
Judge Judy is a boss
If you take my dog the last thing you will worry about is your defence in court.
Judge Judy is for sure an animal lover, she's great, she has a schticky show, but she always comes down on the side of animals. There was an episode of Pitbulls and Parolees where they'd had this very aggressive dog on premises, and they couldn't tame her, she still growled at the workers, and then one day someone claiming to be her owner calls up. They drive the dog to her yard, the *sec*ond this dog gets a whiff of her owner, she becomes a pile of mush and affection. Tia could pet her, she rolled over, she was completely different. Her owner used to be in a bad area where the dog had to be protective, she kept that mindset until she saw her owner again. Really incredible.
Can those women be put in front of a  firing squad for trying to steal this man's poor dog?
Best. Judge. Ever.
„He does that to everybody“ she says while in a room with 50 other people.
shoutout judge judy for handling that like a G
It's hard to stay sad after looking through the top posts of all time here.☺️
I’m not crying. You’re crying
Neighbour’s dog does that to my dad... Um...
People actually believe this shit is real ? Lmao so sad how stupid gullible people are.
[removed]
That looks so staged.
Its Judge Judy yo! Not a real court
Come on down to real fake judge shows!
You have to be a real piece of trash to steal someone's dog.
I'm on my period and my boyfriend of 8 months and I just broke up and i cried so hard. I should get a dog...
People who steal pets are the scum of the earth.
Why would you want to keep a dog the isn't yoursHmmmmm 😒🤔 Dogs are Loyal to their owners You hoe.
My ex-wife was just like this dog. Every time she saw another man she would jump in his lap and start humping him. Sure wish divorce court was that easy!
I see we're playing fast and loose with the term 'court room' today...
> recognizes his owner in court room* in a reality tv show
Both parties win in these Fake court shows.
Wow I'm impressed by a fake court room soap opera drama cuz it feeeeels sooooo reaaaal
Just to be wary guys, that show is pretty much usually always fake. My friend was an actor in an episode once, also on the Spanish one primer impacto, and also on maury if i remember correctly as well. They're all fake lol
[deleted]
I thought it was a real court at first.
Judge Judy for SCOTUS!
I feel like she'd make a decent president...
As someone who had to get the police involved to get my dog back, this legit brought tears to my eyes.
Bring in the dancing lobseters!
This post probably could have used a better title. I was under the impression as the gif started that someone was just bringing the dog in who was wandering around outside. Probably a better title "Stolen dog immediately recognizes his true owner in court room"
If the dog did that to everyone it would have ran to everyone.  It didn't.  It ran to one person.  I love this reunion.
This is a great reason to microchip your pets!  Scan the chip, identification number comes up, they check the I'd number with what's on file, and there you go all the information you should need.
next time she should take a cat. a cat couldn't care less lol
As amazing as this is, I'm a pedantic, so I must point out that Judge Judy's set is as much a courtroom as mayonnaise is a sexual lubricant.
That look of evil when he picked the dog up was starting.
Court room... Judge Judy. Oooookay.
Swift justice has been served once again by the formidable Judith Sheindlin. What a gal.
Isn't judge Judy the court themed Jerry Springer, aka this is staged? So easy to stage btw
I'd love to see a cat version of this, where it just doesn't give a shit
Can someone explain why people stating this is reality tv, and mosty staged, are getting down voted? Is that not the case? You can downvote me too, just please explain why.
Turns out he washed his face with Dog Food beforehand
So scripted
I don't understand how we as a society don't understand that shows such as this a scripted (nearly) to a T. Judge Judy, Bar Rehab, any "reality" TV show in existence really.
That's one happy dog!
What episode?
Omg this is making cry. I'm so glad he got his dog back.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL

The court of paawww.
Nasty lying broads. They fucking knew better.
The lady standing on the right says "He does that to everybody"?? He walked past 50 people & started to sniff & panic when his owner was near. Animals are very conscious & feel as we do
[Here's one after 8 years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRXRv3ZzAw)A bit slower, but well, a Rottweiler of 8-10 years is a really old fart.
Damn watched the video and the defendant was sold the dog for 40 bucks because some crackhead probably found his dog. Listen people if a sketchy person sells you a good looking dog for $40 call the police and also if people contact you saying you might have their lost dog please don't be like this lady.

Damn I love judge judy
If you're wondering why this woman had this man's dog, she bought it for 40 bucks from a guy on the street unknowing that it was a stolen dog.
Omg that is sooooo sweet

How did he find they had the dog
**JUSTICE...**is served.
is this shit real?  lol
Cutest case ever !
At least it wasn't a bird right
Is there a YouTube video of the full thing?
What episode is this?
Can anyone speak to if this is staged? I always question shows like this.
❤️❤️❤️
Eyyy you tell'em Judge judy
I love you mrs judy.
That scene from Air Bud playing out IRL.
Why am I crying
Buuurnnnn.
Geez, every dog that lady walks in with runs right to him! He must have a lot of white poodles!  😄
My dog is a highly desirable breed and coloring, and he's super shy and friendly, so I'm absolutely terrified of having him stolen. Like I will never ever leave him tied up outside a store. I also going to order this "FitBit for dogs" thing that includes GPS tracking, and is small enough that I can attach it to his collar and then slide a bandana over it to make it invisible, because the thought of him getting stolen scares the shit out of me.But at least I know if I ever had to prove he was my dog, I'd just have to walk into his line of sight. He approaches most people, even people he knows fairly well, pretty timidly with his tail between his legs. But when he sees me, at first it's like "is that really you?" followed by "HOLY SHIT IT IS YOU THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER." Like even if I leave the apartment for 15 minutes, that's his reaction when I come back.
Could not like be this more!
Cute: but it's Judge Judy. That shit's staged af.
One of the sweetest things I've ever seen on Reddit.
Why would someone do that ?
Love you Judge Judy!
I'm crying
Judge judy is amazing.
Shits herself.
So thats cool they get the dog back, but what about prosecuting the dog thieves?
"He does that to everybody" Except her
Wtf, did she steal his dog or something?
Doesn't Judge Judy make like $45 million a year or something for her show?  Do you ever wonder how the economic mathematics of that works out?
If I was in court and my brother walked in with his dog it would run and greet me the same way. When I come to visit it gets so excited it pees itself. If anyone else comes and visits it could care less. For some reason I am his dogs favorite person and it isn't close. If I'm over it will never leave my side. I might have to steal his dog
Great gif, or GREATEST GIF?
"court room"
and THIS is why Judge Judy earns $45 million per year and deserves every penny.
Damn; I missed this episode...
/r/MasterReturns/
Right in the feels
"Court room"
context? stolen dog?
F that lady.
I wonder if that dog peed on her leg and called it rain
That is not a court room, it is a stage in a television production studio.
JUDGE JUDY WITH THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGEMENT
My neighbor stole our cat. We went to mediation and she did not want to give him back. I'm not sure what to do
This clip is so good.
Season 19 Ep: 256
Awwww
That dog is like his child. So what you bought the dog off the street. It's NOT yours, they knew full well that he was the real owner. If she really loved the dog she would have given him back to his real dad.
Good work Judge Judy but they used to hang horse thiefs in the Old West. This ain't no different, thieves ought to have hanged.
Well that's what I call an open and shut case 😛
I'm not crying. *You're* crying.
when i want to see the depths of stupidity that is humanity (or some of it), i watch Judge Judy.
Dad? DAD? Daaaaddy!!! Da-da da-daaaaaaay!!! -- the dog
I remember that case. Someone stole the dog from the man's yard and sold it to the defendant for 50 bucks.
Best thing I have ever seen on Reddit. Ever. Thank you.
Judge Judy don't play no shit.
My biggest fear is someone seeing my dog and stealing him because he is so cute and corgis are not easy to get. He is 11 now and I hope he is less desirable to strangers but you can't tell how old he is.
DONT FUCK WITH JUDGE JUDY!
Serious questionIs judge judy a real tv show? Like are these real cases or just for tv?
Literally bringing the evidence to court.
Did anybody else start crying?
Awwww
It's funny because it's a TV show that's produced with a script like the rest of them!
"court room"
Judge Judy is King Solomon!!!! 🤔
He clearly had dog treats in his pocket
Court Dismissed. Bring in the Dancing Lobsters!
Only Judy can judge me.
Lol generally I hate Ol' Jude's brand of justice but this is awesome! Case closed!
Fake or not?  That was cool as fuck.
Can we get this with some sound? Why the hell would you submit this in gif form?

My dog loves humans. He's the type of dog that will jump and run to other humans. He's friends with everybody I mean everybody even drunk people vomiting in the street. I totally understand that lady. My dog does that to everyone as well.
Beautiful
This just goes to show how even the tiniest dogs have the biggest hearts, my pom used to react the same way after not seeing me for some days, this made me smile and crushed me at the same time. Always love your dogs with all your heart, because they love you with all their soul.
Man I would be in court for an entirely different reason if someone stole my dog...
Man who's cuttin all these damn onions
I love that she's still trying to justify it. What a piece of shit.
I have mad respect for Judge Judy. She could have easily been a flash in the pan celebrity from the 90s, ending up on an E! special about where she is now. And yet she has managed to stay relevant and more importantly, make some mad bank for like 20 years
Ohhhh I'm such a fucked up person for secretly thinking the dog is just a happy little Doug and would do this to anyone and that lady may have actually lost her dog lmao
😭😭😭
We need judge Judy to sort out all the racist In America 🙌🏻
Only Judy can judge me.
What's the dog equivalent of catnip?  Does he work at a tennis ball factory and just smells really good to dogs?

This made me cry
My dog was stolen out of my yard when I was little. My story didn't have a happy ending, but seeing that some people do get reunited with their dogs really does warm my heart.
judge judy ftw!
Judge Judy is so awesome.
I'm really glad they got their puppy back
fucking easier job in the world
Lesson:Stupid bitches makes you mad.Smart women make you laugh, tear joyfully, your life better.
REKT
That brought a tear to my eye
Awwww
I always thought this show was staged?
Is chipping required in USA, or was this before chipping?
It's funny because my mother in law "stole" someone's dog that looked just like this right out of their back yard forever ago. It was being left alone for days on a short chain, fed whatever scraps and hair was so unkempt. His name is zero and he's totally still alive. She's had him for 12 years now.
Don't fuck with Judge Judy.
I was kind of hoping for a wisdom-of-Solomon-cut-the-dog-in-two scenario.
Pick the dog up faster!!
Whenever I see Judge Judy I see Al Pacino. If Pacino was a woman he'd look like Judge Judy.
I always thought her show was fake? This seems too real.
It's not a real courtroom
Hi,  I'm new here
Please link, I need to hear Judge Judy deliver this sweet justice in full, uncut glory.
Holy shit I hope this happens to me, my ex took my dog away last week :(
I feel like my dog might run to my mother in this situation. (No, we do not live together; I suspect she secretly gives him junk food.)
Belongs in r/Judge_Judy_for_SCOTUS
That's the best thing I've seen all day
Judge Judy for president.
this made me cry.
First time I've seen her not be an asshole. That was a fast case also lol.
Is this a movie or is this a real court?
Right in them feels
I have the same sort of dog and she does that to everyone
is judge judy an actual courtroom or is it fictitious?
Do you mean 'stolen' dog?
In all fairness as a girl whose owned a lady beagle herself since puppyhood, my dog is a whore for any standard white guy with a beard. She loves them.
"court room"
As soon as the dog got closer even before that man said anything you can see the dog smelling his scent and starting to wriggle out of her arms getting excited. So cute
I think everyone needed this today.
Obviously staged
I teared up a little
Though if you watch the source, when she says he does that to everybody he's actually jumping excitedly back to her. So it might be he was attached to both of them which is sad too.
Meanwhile I went to say hi to my cat after he was living with my brother for 3 months, he wouldn't even go near me :(
The lady said that the dog "does that to everyone".  Well, not quite.  The dog ran right past her to see the man.
There was a couple college girls who tried to adopt a puppy from the humane society but he was spoken for. So they fucking went into the kennels and stole it. It was on camera so they got caught right away.... but still
"Lost"
The iq q
This is some Air Bud shit
I read about this. The situation sucks for both. She bought a dog, grew attached to it, and did not want to part with it. But it was clearly that mans dog.Personally if I was the guy, I would have talked to the lady let her know she could come visit when ever she wanted, or take him at her place from time to time.Who ever stole the dog and created this situation for these to is most definitely scum.
"Court room"
People do this to their own own helpless children for selfish reasons. As sickening as it is , it's not a surprise people do it to animals.
Is there a legit reason someone would steal a dog?
In the clip, the lady who bought the dog off the street tells the girl not to put the dog down. Honestly, not a big fan of her
Unfortunately my dog would do this for anyone she has spent a lot of time around. She'll stick with me when she calms down, but initial contact with someone she recognizes is very exciting. If it was done this way, I would be screwed if I had a crazy ex who wanted to steal my dog.
Check his pockets, probably has treats in them shits
Guile's theme goes with this...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGw8DWctAts
Lmfao "ya take the dog, its yours."
This made me happy, thank you
Is that a Bichon Frise?
Judge Judy loves dog, its her secret weakness.
Am I the only one with hidden onions in the room??? Somethings irritating my eyes. Just. Can’t. Stop. Tearing up.
Before walking became an issue for our dog (lame leg, bad hip), she would behave the same way whenever my mom was around. She still gets excited to see her, despite also going blind, too.
So romantic
This reminds me of a time not so long ago in a land not so far away. I was watching cartoons one sleepless night at 3am, when all of a sudden I hear a massive ruckus taking place on my yonder porch. With heart rate beating a heavy tattoo in my ears I hesitantly a peered onto said mentioned porch. When's all of a sudden a small fur ball cute as a button did appear, my freshly knock over garbage hanging out its cute teeth. Two score months pass and I had made the little ruffian my own. A small little Pittbull, who stole my heart along with my garbage. She peed on my floor and ate my food, making herself right at home in my domicile. She a bore no tags, a no name. So I kept her as my own. Posting flyers for the little whippersnapper around.Three score more months pass by and the little tike was growing quickly, when as suddenly as she appeared I hear a knocking. A pale lady came bearing the flier, her eyes filled with misty tears when she a saw my little fur ball. Then the little skank herself run up to the teary eyed damsel, forever leaving me with thoughts of what could have been. Bitch.
This is nice and all, and I'm sure this has been pointed out, but what if the dog lived with that guy for a while and knows him very well, but just hasn't seen him in a long time? I'm just not entirely sure that behaviour suggests he *owns* the dog, but the dog will be happy with him anyway.
"court room"
They stole this from Air Bud
This actually made me tear up. So adorable.
It's like the scene from Air Bud
Man I needed that today.
Fucking Judge Judy giving me the feels - it's like a combination of /r/Frisson and /r/WTF.
So, it's a custody battle over a dog?Wow.  Sorta reminds me of the king who had two women in his court arguing over how the baby belonged to.  The king gets fed up with the bickering in front of him, and tells them that, if they can't agree on who gets sole ownership, he'd cut the baby in half and give them each a piece.One woman nearly screams at the idea, and begs the other woman to just take the baby.The king gives the baby to the woman offering to give it away instead of having the baby killed.
No No he does that to everyone.
This is my happiest and most deserved upvote.
Fuck yeah
Pieces of shit like that who steal a dog and then lie about it ought to be charged with having stolen property. They are the lowest form of life.
u/WaterGuy12 would love this
Literally almost cried.
Lol that's funny
A
This is definitely real and not at all scripted.  Judge Judy, and daytime TV as a whole, is known for its authenticity.
Good job he didn't loose his cat.
Just in case you thought this show was real...
Hold up judge Judy is real? Lol I thought it was scripted lmao
Awww!!! That little dog was overwhelmed to see it's daddy. I'm glad it turned out well for the dog.
This is how the judicial system should work always
"Court room"
"Hey boy"

Stealing dogs should be punishable by death.
To prove the point...my dog would have humped me for good measure
Fuck yes. I love this
Man I would hate to have a dog like that. Just watching this makes me tear up, can't imagine having him and someday losing him too
could it be the best post/repost ever on /r/aww?
Judge Judy for supreme court
That extreme close up on judge judys face when she started nodding when the dog ran up to him had me in stitches
I fucking hate petty people
That judge kicks ass.
Can someone plz link this episode on YouTube
Punish those women , they are not good human beings
Poor woman, poor the man, poor the dog, fuck the fucking thief.
Context?
Awwww
are these things staged or real cases?
Glad the owner is reunited with his dog, they seem really happy to see eachother.
"Lost" and "stolen" are not the same.  That doggo was clearly stolen.
Is there a video of this anywhere?
So you've been watching Judge Judy clips on YouTube, huh?
source videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g
Yeah Judge Judy you tell em.
Something about big black dudes loving and owning small dogs warms my heart. That lady needs to go check out the local shelter and find her own creature of unconditional love.
Got to love that ruling.
This is so adorable...
"Thats what happens when you buy it for 50 bucks infront of the mall"
Same thing happened to a girl I dated in highschool. Her neighbors watched their dog, liked it, and literally took it
What episode is this?
I would have thought the dog would have started chasing the Byrd
If that was a cat. It will say "fuck you" to its owner as he runs towards the food.
That lady to the left in the audience when she first walks in really hated her nose
Where's the dog in this gif??
Ok stupid question, are these real court cases, or is judge Judy strictly entertainment?
The dog even acted like a child who finds it mother.
Ruff justice.
Isn't this stuff staged though?
Dog custody trials always make me emotional.
Question of genuine interest. Is judge Judy a legal judge?
"Court"
The owner did not immediately pick up his dog when he was jumping excitedly around him. Which owner wouldn't? Makes me a little suspicious about him being the real owner or not.
Have we learned nothing from that one spongebob episode
/r/eyebleach
AMAZING!!!!
Whelp, there goes me not crying today.
Thanks!!
Is this a show or something ?
Is this a scripted show, a reality show, or an actual court case?
Dogs are awesome
Why tf would that dude lie about the dog being his? Lol
You're crying
too good
*tv studio
You can tell the second he smells him and he probably hasnt smelt him in so long and hes so damn happy.
I had a bad day today and this really made me smile
This is why I respect judge Judy
This is why you microchip your dog!
That was super satisfying to see.
This warmed my cold dead heart
I fucking love judge Judy smh
"Court"
Seeing this makes me want to cry also
I bet you money there is a treat in his pocket
We don't deserve Judge Judy
"court"
but, it was his dog. Sorry.
My dog does that to everyone. I hope I never have to go to court.
Can someone let me know what episode this was so I can watch it?
this is as real as every other reality tv show out there.
No video?
Those puppies always say the truth dude
Maybe he is just a dog whisperer who knew saying "hey baby boy" would net him a free dog...
I don't think anyone will ever understand how much I needed to see this today.
-Put the dog down!-Really your honor? Right here in the middle of the court?
Judge Judy and executioner
Dogs are just great.
Don't care how staged it is, that's how my pupper reacts to me coming home, that shit is REAL.
Judge Judy's nod of approval, I need a gif of that.
That instantly made my day lmao
I've watched this 20 times and smile or tear up each time.
Lmao mans best friend
The dog clearly knows who dad is!Good dog!
What exactly was this case about?
nothing better in the entire world than dogs :)
I would be in tears at first sight if I saw my dog in that fashion after that many months of being forced apart.
Gotta hand it to Judge Judy
I love this
I loved it when another lady came in with a very similar looking dog right after!
Judge Judy owning chumps like usual.
>Courtroom-->Judge Judy
Man I'm way to drunk to watch this right now 😭😭😭 lol
Why did this bring a tear to my eye?
Hope the lady found a new dog that loved her too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g
This is some wise king solomon business right here
I was just looking at pics and videos of my dog cause I miss him so much. I won't see him till Thursday and haven't seen him since last Tuesday. I then click on this and started crying. Fuck I don't wanna go away without my boy again
Did they really need Judge Judy to point something so obvious out?
"Court room"
Lol that doggo is longgo
I wonder how the case even came about
My dog acts like this anytime someone enters my apartment. Everytime my brother in law visits by dog goes apeshit. Not sure how he'd act in a full court room though.
Why can't I view this?
Awww
This is amazing!
loving animal
It's not every day you get to see the birth of a new sub on the front page!
Love my dog, but her dumb butt would go up to everyone. Lol However, I am glad he got his dog back. :)
And now, for another quick mystery:Dog: "Where's my human?!"Guy: "Right here, buddy"Judge Judy: "Case closed."Wow, that one was *really* fast.
To be fair, when I go visit my parents, our dog freaks out and gets so excited to see me for like a few minutes, then retreats back to his real favorites--my mom or dad.
Can I upvote this twice please
Probably had a cookie in his pocket
That's the kind of boost I need before work :)
Isn't that staged? It looks staged.
I honestly don't know of anyone ever having their pet stolen...
GET FUKT LADY
*stolen dog
Lol "court room"
No wonder she is the highest paid Tv star.
Put the dog down? Wow Judie, harsh.
What was het punicement? Somebody who knows IT?
Simply Beautiful. I'm so glad that dogs will always be wonderful, loyal friends to us.
Awww they stuck to the script
I can't help but think of the 0.1% chance where it's actually there dog and they are acting strange that day
We do not deserve dogs! They are amazing
source : https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g
Wait I'm confused did the lady who had the dog like take the dog and she basically saying it's hers buts it not
i can hear this in her voice "its his dwog"
Wowie
my dad produced a dad comment when I showed him this. He said. Oh so the guys name is Everybody?
I'm not going to scroll and see if it's been posted but these shows are a scam.  The looser pays nothing.  The show pays all damages.  You might as well make up a story with your best friend then pretend to sue them then split the winnings.
Chances are both of these people are very much aware who the dog owner is. Even though there may have been a legal battle at some point, they were most likely payed to act as if there were still an actual dispute. Regardless of the outcomes on Judge Judy, both parties to a case emerge as winners. That's because the show pays for the arbitration award, along with the litigants' airfare and hotel expenses. For most litigants, that adds up to a free trip to Los Angeles.
My favorite part is Judge Judy seeing the dog going nuts for his owner and she's just like "yup. Dog is his"
Stalking your Reddit account and I wasn't prepared to see your asshole.
Oh my dog!
Has anybody mentioned Rick and Morty yet?
"In court room"Maybe should be"On TV set"
Source/Clip
Certain things you see just being a tear to your eye and this got me. A dogs love and loyalty to their owner is unbeatable
This would really piss me off if Judge Judy wasn't staged.
Will everyone stop peeling those onions?  I'm TRYING to watch the clip!
I wish I had Judge Judy when my ex wife stole my dog.
[D:  ...  :D](https://youtu.be/kMQE2vlcL-M)
God i love Judge Judy.
r/braceface
This is one smooth judge ...."That's all, take the dog home"*Drops mic*
This is the happiest thing I've seen all day.
Lol, I watched that same gif for ten minutes strait.
This breaks my heart. We just found a puppy this past weekend that was nearly starved to death. We nursed it back to health only for the owners to recognize it this morning. We gave it back of course, but not before they accused us of stealing it and threatening to call the police. Absolute vile scum.
This reminds me of the time my dog went missing, spent an hour or so looking for her, found her with an old woman. For obvious reasons she was sceptical as to whether it was our dog or not. So I said "bring her 'round to mine, soon as she sees my step dad, you'll know she's our"Lo and behold, the second she saw him she acted exactly like this. It's nice to know she's back with her loving owner.
My dog wouldn't do that. She is a total attention whore and will go to anyone 😂
Context please...
i am real lover of it.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
the girl said "no." before putting him down, she knew shed screwed up
I often wonder how much of this is staged. Or is this show at least semi legit?
Reminds me of the film/book Annie.  So cute
I always preferred Night Court.....Judy was never remotely convincing in a stage managed tv studio.
@brocollimonster :3
Mind Blowing
I love Judge Judy. Such a legend.
OMG
my landlord's dog responds to me like this when he hasn't seen me for a while
If that was my dog he would be wanting down asap and running to everyone in the room, nevermind me
You could see the dog recognize his smell first.
Can someone tell me what's the name of this episode?
Is it a teddy.......
It's judge judy - i always wondered, is it fake?
Does everybody think, that this is real? Isn't it a scripted show?
No, he just wanted the cookie in your pocket!
Take the dog home, bring in the dancing lobsters!
HE TOOK MA DERG!

Why steal a dog? Aren't there better things to take?
Reality tv or real?
Judge judy a woman with the wisdom of Solomon.
if it was a cat, it would've chosen the one who offers more food loli love catsthey're sooo...cats
gif got stuck.. i put the dog down =(
Try it with a cat this time. I would love to see that haha.
I love Judge Judy for being so succinct. "Take the dog home."
I have a maltese at home. When she sees someone she recognises after a long time, she behaves exactly this way. She sometimes cries a bit and barks as well, in excitement.I'm not sure if this was an accurate way to justify the ownership of the dog.If it was a wrong verdict, I feel really bad for those ladies.
Why does this look so fake.
Well that was expected, possibly
ITT People who don't seem to understand this is a fake scripted TV show.
Animals don't lie!
Damn it! I couldn't watch the video.Just a black screen.
No time for that
I can't believe how low people can get.. Seriously? stealing someone's pet?
you do realize those are staged?
Same way my doggie got excited the 2 times he got lost. First in the pound than at the humane society. First time some one had "claimed" him.....
Is this like an actual court or is it a reality show? (Judge jody)
You are...the father!!!
Is someone cutting onions? I think I might have something in my eye
that's one good doge.
He knows his owner full stop
what sort of maniac would take someones dog away from them

Great, I just got busted for watching Judge Judy at work... D'oh!
So love this!!
glad he has his dog back
court room..?? PLEASE...
Awww man this just made me go awww I totally love this website full of cute and funny content.
When the video looped, I thought oh shit another lady with another dog just like it?? This is getting heated!
I love the internet. This made my week.  Dogs are amazing creatures.
My cat would do this.  He's not completely soulless.
My dog just immediately runs to the first male she sees...
Common sense.  You gotta love Judy.
"Court room"
Laww court.
Lol. Id totally get my girlfriends dog in this scenario. It always goes apeshit when it sees me but couldnt give two shits about my gf
One of the few times that someone actually loses something on Judge Judy
Nice little moment. not often you see a case that sweet. The defendant got screwed when the 'baby boy' was brought into court. Still...aww indeed :)
I'm tearing up ..don't judge me! You don't know my life!
I don't own a dog, but when I do... you fuck with me you die
Justice served, much satisfaction.
Pet reunions always make me cry. I never cry, not even in funerals... but doggies reunited with their bestest friend gets me every time.
I don't know the back story on this, but I hope after what this man went through that he made sure to microchip his dog. It can really help to make sure a lost or stolen dog makes its way back home.
Okkm
My dog woundnt do that tho this isn't full proof
M
Peter Campbell : A thing like that!
This lost all credibility as soon as I realized it was Judge Judy.
The good ol' treats in the pocket.  Works everytime.
This is so wholesome. And moving. I'm crying. 😭
The fact that he probably met the woman and had to bring this to court is what pisses me off. If you want a dog, and have the means to take care of one, get a dog, dont take someone elses.
damn so mesmerizing
You can tell who is right and wrong by the meanness on the face of the horrible dog stealer versus the nice guy who rightfully owned the dog.*Bangs gavel*
NO DOGS ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM. judy: bring me the  dog
Love judge Judy!!!
I was hanging out in the car with our Bostons while my husband dashed into the grocery store one day.   Some people came up to me and complimeneted the dogs and then just straight out said "so how much you want for them?", as if I would just sell two of the three reasons I care about existing in order to provide for.  Am certain they would have stolen them had I not been there.
Looks like the dog was "Wait? Is that?" And one he goes "Hey, boy!" He recognized his voice.
That's EXACTLY how my dog would act... except he would be barking at anyone who looked at me or got near me lol
Wow already one of the top posts of all time , of course there's judge Judy in it.
Does someone know what episode this is from? I'd like to watch the whole case.
Dogs make the best judges.

Not so much lost....as stolen
Isn't all this shit scripted?

That's not a courtroom.
Late to the party, but I just love it when dogs get to testify in court.
Top post of all time on this sub in thirteen hours. 10/10
In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.   Hold on, she's losing sight in her good eye too.  The miracle of glaucoma or cataracts.
Anybody know the name of this show?
When I was a kid, we adopted a dog from a shelter, my sister and I we're out front playing with him when he did something like this, it was very unusual for him so it was really weird.  The family he ran up to just looked at him shocked and said "DogsName?!?" It was his previous owners, they had 3 kids but the third had an allergy to dogs so they had to give him up.  It was heartbreaking hearing him wimper when they left.

Loyal Dog
This made me so happy. Dogs are so loyal.
This is beautiful! 10/10, such a good pup
Although this is a fake set and everything, still hits home every time I watch it.
What kind of a terrible person tries to keep another persons pet and fights them in court over it?
What's the plot? Somebody finds a lost dog, owners track em down but the finders won't give it back?
why the gif looked like its from a tv show?
What souless douchebag would ever steal another person's dog?
I just cried - way to start my morning
I am not crying....
Where I use to live, ppl steals dogs and sadly, it happened to me with both of my dogs.The first was stolen when we was out one day and learned from the neighbor wife a seven months later, her husband came over to our house and cut the rope from the pole and tried to take him but Lil guy bite him and fought back. Dude got pissed off and rip off my dog collar and called animal control and said there was a stray dog attacking him and they took my poor dog away and we went to see where gave him away to see where we can get him back but sadly, they put him down.The neighbor moved(it's why she told us) after her husband went to jail for shooting a clerk at a mini store.Second dog was stolen after we give it away to a friend. She told us that she let him out on her yard to pee and run around when kids from her block came running to her door, saying a guy came out of a yellow car and jumped over fence and grabbed him with a bag and took off. We have no idea what happened him but I heard rumors there was a dog fighting ring in the city and I feared that what happened to him. He's a toy dog but I bet the asshole didn't care
Any idea what episode this is?
And that's why I'm a dog person
Oh you know, same ol' same ol' sup widd yah?
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen 😭😭😭
MAN tears.
Not always a fan of Judy, but she nailed this one!
That's one hyper pupper
Word to the wise. Never buy a random pet off of the street.
I would like to see the entire show. What could those women say?
Judge Judy gets paid $45 million dollars a year to yell at people who have absolutely nothing.
And dogs don't just use their sight to recognize someone, they use their sense smell too. That's a pretty positive ID.
Commenting for posterity.
Now I'm even more confused
Love this story!
Actually cried. Wtf man ಠ_ಠ
Man, a dog never lies! But cats, that a whole different story! Boom!
The people who kept this dog and owner apart are scum. Humiliation on TV is not nearly what they deserved.
just like the ending of Air Bud
Fuck yeah Judy.
How can you steal a mans best friend?
What's the sub? R/mademecry?
IM JOSE CONSECO!
TV has devolved into pure trash.
The fuck
This show is fake
this needs to go on r/poodles
This is one of the reasons I LOVE Judge Judy!
I've always wondered, is Judge Judy scripted or fake or something?
Does anybody know if any of the stuff on that show was actually real?
"Court room"
ayy homedog is back
Doggo
[removed]
The lady tried to steal a dog that is a cunty thing to do, get out of your ass for a sec and realize who I’m talking about
God that made me feel good! Thanks for posting
Fuck kinda court case is this... "Whose dog is it anyway?"
This is judge Judy?
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate
Judge Judy is so annoying.
>> court roomI see what you did there.
Lol why is this gif 174mb
Awww. it was heart-wrenching :'(
Who steals a dog??
Wasn't this the plot of a Disney channel movie?
I actually seen this episode on TV
a comment.
Heh
I must have missed the part where he ran to everybody in the court room
That close in is the best part.
I want to smoke the upvote button 1000 times on this.
Judge Judy is Solomon
"He does that to everybody" he literally just ran right past you
That lady is a fucking bitch. “He does that to everybody.”
my heart is GLOWING right now
Sauce ?
"I'm just gonna stand here now"
This reminds me a ton of the story of King Solomon trying to determine which woman was the real mother of the baby.
This made me tear up
Ho that's where the judge gif comes from
Just me thinking that he could have deliberately put some yummy dog treats in his pockets? I think I’ve seen that done in movie(s), not sure if it would actually work :P
I had my dog stolen by construction workers that were doing work where they had to pass through our yard and use our driveway. He was constantly running away and eventually ran from them and back to us.
This is literally the ending to "Air Bud".
You Americans dont understand that this is all staged?
fukkin rekt
So this is what Reddit has become? Judge Judy on front page.
I really love the little nod and squint she made to the owner of the dog, the universal facial expression of "I got you." What an awesome clip
Well how fucking scientific Judge Judy
The guy may have had a bone in his pants
My mom stole her neighbor's cat and had it neutered🤣
The dogs obviously racist.
 cameras & pets have 1 thing in common. They can't lie
[deleted]
Takes dog home and "he dose that to everyone". Keeps dog.
I want someone to look at me like this doggo looks at his owner
Love it. Doggo comes in and is understandablely confused, then sees his human and is like "hey, wtf you doing here? I thought you left" "Hey boy" "FUCK YOU REMEMBER ME?!?!!? What the fuck is going on? Do you know this person? She took me! SHE TOOK ME BRO!!!!! SHE TOOK ME!!!" "Put the dog down" "BRO ITS ME YOU REMEMBER ME DONT YOU FUCK ITS YOU!!! HOLY SHIT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU!!!! SHIT MAN IM SO HAPPY FUCK I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE" "Pick the dog up" "YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS" Luvey luvey luv luvs!! "He does that to everyone" **"WHY ARE YOU TALKING HOE??"**
The title is misleading, it should say "Dog recognizes owner in joke room".
"courthouse"
Bullet to the head if you steal any of my animals
You mean TV set.
"Court room"
To be fair, if I brought my dog in the room, he would've done the same thing, excited to meet new people
This is so much more interesting than normal dog shows
"I was a good dog! Look at me go!"
It looks like she even mimics the routine a bit as she's watching it.
Holy crap, I wonder if she recognizes herself? I wonder if she remembers? It is a Border Collie so I guess it's entirely possible.
Link to video of the run if anyone is interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJL183YIENM
"I'M ON TV! I'M ON TV! Mum!!! Look!!! I'M ON TV!"
Her excitement knows no Borders.
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen on reddit holy crap
Kirk is playing virtual reality dog.
My name is also Kirk.

Wow those nintendogs obstacle courses were on point.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
She’s doggone proud of herself. As she should be.
My border collie just ate a cat turd out of the litter box.
Who else heard “boing, boing, boing...” in their head while watching this?
"It's me! It's me! Look, I'm doing so good!"
"I did it, moooom!"
[removed]
You really confused me when I read that as "former Border Collie"
Source video? I want to hear the dog!
Rewatching the tape like all pro athletes do. Respect.
What moron buys gold for gallowboob?
Can't dogs like, not see the picture on a TV? I'm guessing she's reacting to the sounds
Here is the full version of Kirk watching Kirk with sound.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzqH6TzDY&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzqH6TzDY&feature=youtu.be)
Thanks for posting this. Made my morning. Such enthusiasm and unbridled joy. You go pupper.
How in sync she is at the start going from sitting to running is great. I picture her watching this daily for years to come like Uncle Rico.
GallowBoob strikes again, harvesting that karma...
Reliving the dream!
Congratulations lil Kirk you did so well!
"OH BOY THATS ME THATS ME THATS ME-"
THIS IS AMAZING
Gif is down. Mirror?
>Kirk>FemaleWtf
Staggers me that she can keep up with the editing and cuts the same way we can.
Kanye West watching a Kanye West video..
THAT IS SOOOOO CUTE!!!!!
Anyone have a link to a mirror of this? Looks like it was taken down.
I hope she got collieflowers as her prize.
This was cool, and then I saw it’s just another u/gallowboob repost lmao
Holy crap. At first glance, I thought this was a post directed towards me!
Boarder collie expert gallowboob
fast dogg
This is so freaking cute
huh! from the doggo's I've ever owned, they all seem to treat the TV as a bright, loud box and had little capacity to see shapes on the screen.
*"Go me, Go me Go me"*
This is me when I watch my own Snapchat stories over and over.
Reminds me of Nintendogs!
Do you think she realizes that is her?
Captain Kirk! :>D
 These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.
r/GifsThatEndTooSoon.
This is border-line adorable. Also always a great idea to study tape for next time
They say the dogs don't recognize themselves in the mirror (or on TV?) but having had a border collie that was smarter than some people I have met, I disagree.  My dog's been gone over 25 years and I still miss her every day.
Why name a girl Kirk?
This is awesome
"That's me! *bounce* *bounce* That's me!"
Border collies are so damn smart
Great job on the pups part!!! Maybe purina should put as much effort as this dog to try and improve their subpar product. Anything made by purina is pure dog shit...and that's BEFORE the digestion!!!
She’s amazing
That’s adorable, she looks so proud of herself! Very aww worthy
Border collies and aussies are damn near the same. That jumping is exactly what my dog does
I was pumped for her.
What an egotist
How do people train dogs to do this?
Gotta watch tape if you wanna improve.
whatever happened to u/GallowPlaceholder ?
Reliving her triumphs! So cute.
"GO ME, GO ME, GO ME"
this needs sound!
You can see her getting all amped up. Ready to run through the fucking wall if the handler told her to.
I bet that dog doesn't eat Purina.
That was fucking adorable.
I watched this on YouTube! She's fantastic!
Good dogo
This is amazing
Man the slalom part is impressive.
I think I just watched that on YouTube haha. and here I'm watching the Collie watch itself on the TV!
Thank you. Needed this!
Gods I was strong!
LOOK HOOMAN, THAT IS ME! I AM DOING THE THING!
“I’m on TV!! I’m on TV!!!”
Now can we do a video of the dog watching this video
Holy shit thats so cute
Now we need a video of the dog watching herself watching herself win.
Oh hell yes
Something makes me thinks she’s excited...
Yeah dude I know that feel that’s a good feel
“Go me, GO!”
She’s a beast!!!
Border collies are the best
Is she in the 2018 or no
Source please?
IT’S ME! IT’S ME! IT’S ME! IT’S ME!
I need someone to give me as much encouragement as this dog gives itself
Shout out to 2011 where this was all I did in Nintendogs to get more dogs.That time when I deleted my save and lost my labrador and couldn't stop crying for a week...
Is her being a female any significant or are we all about gender rights for animals now?
A pro at zoomies
I think this is my first GallowBoob encounter in the wild. Hello there!
This right here is the best.
Look even DOG athletes aren't humble lol.
This is so awesome!  How does she know the dog on screen is her?
This is the best video I've seen on here.GO KIRK...YOU FUCKING LEGEND!!!!
Good doggo
137k upvotes after 6 hours?Check
Aww she's such a good boy.
I know how she feels. I like to watch myself too. Hehehe
Doggo like, "That's me mom! That's me!" So adorable❤
Im pro-naming pets unorthodox names but Kirk?
Run, you beautiful devil, run!!
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/GallowBoob![Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
and it was not that many years back when animal science was saying dogs could see shapes and spaces on TV but they could never know what they were seeing. This here border collie knows he is watching kitty cat obsticle course on his HDTV! :)
Be your biggest fan
6 days -> top u/GallowBoob postSeems legit
Do you have a mirror?
Who names a dog Kirk.. much less a female.
This is wholesome as hell.
This is probably a stupid question but is it possible to breed out their short lives? Can we breed them to live longer than 10 years? They love us so much but they leave us so soon :(
God damn it not GallowBoob
Gallowboob back at it again
You’ve really got the recipe for karma down, u/gallowboob.
Fun fact: just about none of the dogs who compete in this competition eat any Purina foods, because they're absolute trash foods made by a trash company.
If only my nintendogs could do this
TIL; This dog is infinitely smarter than most people I know. Can she become my manager?
And they say dogs can't see themselves! Seems this pupper knew exactly what was going on.
This is the most wholesome and wonderful thing ever!!!
Dem mirror neurons
I read the title as "Kirk, a former Border Collie..." and was like, but...then what is she now?!@
Border collies are amazing
Bordie collies are so smart it's amazing.  Their ability to learn is so incredible.  Very sensitive animals as well.   They need a lot of exercise and attention or they can really cause a lot of trouble.
This is adorable
*"Look at me! I was fabulous!"*
Haaah!! I looks as if she’s trying to participate! Man I love dogs
Any experts know if she knows it’s a recording of herself?
Omg that’s great!!!
#JESUS CHRIST ITS JASON BOURNE#
"OH MY GOD THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME! THATS ME! LOOK AT ME GO! I WON CUZ IM THE BEST! YAY ME! "
“And then I jumped the thingy and then and THEN I went into the tunnel and I ran as fast I could and then I bombed it across the field..”
this is some r/eyebleach material right here
Me when I am playing a fighting game
So I've always wondered why some dogs watch TV and others dont. My dog growing up didnt give a shit about dogs on TV or even dog sounds on TV. But then this dog and others online respond directly to TV.
Awesome!
She's so excited!
This is awesome, please post the vid!
Flexing as always
The bouncing excitement!!!! What a precious floof.
Animals also have sportsmanship😮
"I'M DA BEST"
BCs are the only neurotic breed I will always love.
THE JUMPING UP AND DOWN!! GOOD DOG!!
She knows exactly what she’s watching. That’s awesome.
##i can talk big
mOM LOOK IM ON TV MOooOoMmm LOOK
I had no idea that the Purina Pro Challenge was a thing. Now I know what my wife and I are going to spend the next few hours watching. Thank you!
Nice.
“Go, me! Yay! GO! GO, ME!!”
THIS IS SO PURE AND WHOLESOME
Border Collies are the best.
That’s a very smart dog.
That was 7 years ago. This dogs living in the past.
Don't insult human intelligence, *Kirk!*
That pupper is so excited.
The internet may have been for porn, but now it's for this! And porn.
My dog does the same thing while watching me play Fortnite.  Less bouncing with excitement, though... more just tilting his head as I transform without warning into a pile of weapons (mostly gray pistols).
What a happiness :D
fast as fuck
CONCEITED!
Awwwwwwewweeeeeee this is so sweet.
It's like NIIC The Singing Dog's track Instinct!
2017 Purina Good Boi challengeMy dog would chew on some poles and lay down for a nap.
Now THATS a good girl
Oh my heart
Dog: "THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME!..."
"That's me! That's me!!"
Is there any physiological difference between male and female Border Collies, or dogs in general? At least differences that would give them an upper paw in competitions of strength, agility, or intelligence?
r/animaltippytaps
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJL183YIENM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJL183YIENM) competition video of winning run
Why it is called Border Collie?
Hahaha
Link with sound of dog going nuts?
this just made my fucking week
I wish I was that excited about my accomplishments!
“Look at that dog go!! Wow! Oh wait that’s me!!! Go me!!!”
Aren't dogs unable to see TVs like how humans do because they lack one colour receptor in their eyes...
Hilarious.    The heart of a champion!Love the pogo jumping.
border collies are so smart :]
This is awesome
This is the most meta thing I've seen so far today.
Awww she looks just like mine! Lol that's amazing.   Thank you for sharing!
“GO ME!”
Precious!
"GO ON ME! YAAAAY ME! WOOHOO!"
TIL: reviewing training films works for dogs too
I remember the first time i was on tv... My mom told me to get down because i was messing up the reception.
This about to break the front page
Why does it have no notes?
Legend has it she is still jumping till this day...
You can see the fast mental rerouting after that last pipe to the correct stage.
"Gods, I was strong then!"
Soo 😎
“Go me, go me, go me...”
Hyped! 😍
I couldn’t think of anything clever to say regarding cute doggo, so here’s my poor attempt at gold.
"That could be me some day!""Kirk, that was you. Yesterday."
Meh
This reminds me of bojack horseman
what a narcissist.
“Look at how fast I go!”
Fantastic video. Made my day watching Kirk. Thank u for sharing!!!! Wonderful 😊
Wow that’s funny / amazing
This is awesome.
She smoked it.
This is another level of awwww
Dogs like this amaze me
Imagine having this much self confidence/ pride in yourself.
I love border Collies so much
How is it possible that I didn't notice the dog jumping in front of the TV? I guess I was focusing on something else.
Does this qualify as an audio commentary?
Border collies should be classed as non-human persons.
Dogs are very intelligent creatures! No doubt she knows she did something good
r/likeus
That's one fast dog
You probably beat your dog.
IT ME IT ME IT ME
Its like Mr. Satan watching his past championship
She’s so freaking adorable 😊
This is adorable!
I have so many theory of the mind questions.
Yay! Go me!
I have a Border Collie who is lazy. I remember when I first got them everyone told me that they are super high energy and need to be put to work so I took him on long hikes. Thirty minutes into a hike he just would roll over and relax.Right now he is laying on my couch above pillows.When I go in the backyard to go in the pool, he stays inside because he likes the AC.He just likes playing with his plush toys- Mr. Bill and elephant..by playing around I mean he just shakes them up and down like he is breaking their neck. Granted he's a Border Collie/Austrian Shepherd/Terrier/Corgie mix :)
This literally melts my heart
Hey its me!
Gotta support yourself no matter what. Always have to have your own bark, as they say
I thought it was only us and dolphins that recognise themselves in mirrors etc. She's just watching TV 😋
She’s almost coaching herself! She’s even ghosting the routine. (Jumps when running, tippy taps when going through tunnels, does jukes through poles..)
So they just named this dog without knowing it's a girl, right?  Do they have a son named Jessica?
Next show her a video of herself reacting to watching herself on TV
She *knows*.
Kirk
KOFY, Stereo TV 20, San Francisco
Those competition are so fun to watch. Sadly they are really hard to find online. Does anyone here have a good source? I mostly watch them on youtube
As always, I am amazed at how high-definition has made it possible for dogs (and cats?) to actually watch television.
  #
I remember when I wanted my nintendo dogs to be like this but they couldn't even manage to walk through those tunnel things.
Dogs are one of best gifts to humans. I'll never live without
Wow… impressive metacognition.
Never forget!
“I don’t know who this bitch is, but she is killing it. I better go train.”
This is so pure.

WOW!
Am I the only one that misread her name as Kink?
This is so wholesome!
It’s like a social media influencer when they watch their own Instagram stories for the 80th time
Is there a source for this video? I really want to send this to some family members but they’d be confused with the Reddit format.
Interesting...
Why does it matter that she’s a female border collie? Lol
THATS ME! THATS ME! THATS ME!
To be the best you gotta study the tapes.
She’s adorable!!! Love it 😝♥️
Can dog comprehend TVs? Do they know what is that and if it's them and they're viewing a recording of themselves and not a actual scenario through a box.
I know some species of animals can pass that self recognition test, (elephants for example, I think?) do some individuals in species that don't ever make that leap?
So cute !
Omg this is so cute
That's meaning
"I'm awesome"
This dog is so egotistical. Who watches their own performance and gets that excited.
Quiet dignity is overrated!
This is the kind of wholesome quality I need in my life. Thank you r/aww
😍
Too bad that dogs don't recognize themselves.
Every time she jumps I hear her yell “go go go”
Hey everyone, come and see how good look!!
Now she knows how amazing she is.  But she already knew
She is just so precious! HUGS!
Nice!
How are Collie's so smart?Serious question. I have a rescue Pug, he's awesome, my good friend even, but I know he's a dork most of the time.
She thought it was another dog and she was cheering them on.
That's me...that's me...that's me.. Look! That's me...
lol
<3
Does the dog comprehend that she's watching herself?
She's watching film to get ready for the next match! Pro doggo! 😍
My dog doesn't even bother looking at the screen when I play something
So cute!!!!!
"hey thats me! Look it's me!"
It looks like she’s kind of acting out the course
This is the best thing ever
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!
I thought dogs couldn’t see TVs because their eyes don’t react fast enough? Clearly that’s not true though
“Get it. Get it. Get it”
😊😊
I once watched a border collie in a city park walk up to a water fountain, stand up, fiddle around and look at it for a minute, then turn on the water and start drinking.I had to look around to make sure I wasn't being pranked.
That’s one fast boi
u/GallowBoob strikes again!
This is so adorable. It looks like she's cheering herself on.
I really hope OP is now running around a course with Kirk. She was reeeeally ready for it. :)
i’m so proud of her

So stinking cute!

Here’s to seeing this on r/animaltextgifs later this week :)
How does one train a doggo like this?

She is fricking visualizing the routine!!!
Damn that doggo can move
I need the longer version.
on that day, border collies around the world became self aware
"That's me!! That's me!!! look look I'm on the tele!!"
Even dogs watch film to review their athletic performance.
Gallowboob. :(
FUCK YOU GALLOWBOOB
Dogs can be egotistical too.
Bit conceited if you ask me.
Border collie’s are such amazing dogs
This is filling my heart with joy!
The footwork crazy
this made my day :')
Is not Kirk a male name?
You go girl!
I wonder if dogs can recognize themselves on camera?
I love this!  That’s awesome.

So stinking cute!!
This is just the definition of precious! Too cute.
“That’s me!! That’s me!! ARE YOU SEEING THIS?? HEY! HEY! Hooman!! HEy!!! That’s me! I did that!”
"That's me, that's me, that's me, that's me".
I wish I was this excited about anything I have ever done
I was watching this like 2 hours ago because it was on TV
Ah the glory days
Ok Gallowboob what's your secret
I tried doing this with my cat.... nothing happens.
She’s got that footwork! Lol
Can someone link me a video link to this gif (with audio) pls?

That bitch is fast.
First post by GallowBoob that I upvote
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen.
When she was dodging through those poles, I was expecting the camera to turn down seeing her dodging left and right in front of the tv
I'm so proud and impressed by her holy shit
The goodest girl
That dog is a rocket!
Wonderful!
Haha! that dog is brilliant i'll be on this subreddit alot more
THAT IS SOOOOO CUTE!!!!!
Modern high resolution screens are going to turn our pets into the next generation of couch potatoes.
I never thought the goodest of dogs existed but there she is!
This is insanely cute - gave me a huge smile
THAT SPEED

Oh, that is so cute! Thanks.

How does u/gallowboob rake in karma like this?
Is this the fastest something has been upvoted so much ? Cuz it totally deserves it
Irrelevant question but why did you have to tell us the dog’s gender?
I love Border Collies!
I dont get how the hell people get their dogs to do this.
All top athletes review their game films.
“I did that! I did that! I did that!”

but (and excue ​my ignorence​) the dog doesn't actually know its watching itself ​right?
Go me go!

Oh my gosh! Who's a good girl?! And how's a good girl?!

Cool!!!!
Look at that fuzzy little bolt of lightning!!!
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.
You have probably added  years to this dog’s life! You have done a great thing here.
When I first meet Buddy the poor guy could barely walk/waddle without getting out of breathe. He hated the leash and refused to leave his owner’s side so I had to carry him down the street and force him to walk back. Now he loves his daily walks and can even run.  So proud of Buddy! Edit 1: Thank you for the reddit gold and all the kind words!!!!Y’all are too kind! Edit 2: The before and after is after 6 months of walking. He gets walked around the block every day. He was a rescue but we think he is a 10 yo chihuahua mix. Also I swear he is happy! He just looks grumpy!
Aww! Good job, both of you- Buddy for getting in shape and you for being a good human being! ❤
r/progresspics needs this
I think you did a wonderful thing and I'm certain you've enriched his life and his mental health and that both he and the old lady you help love you dearly for it. The photos make me laugh though because in the second one, his squint makes he look like he is glaring into your soul with resentment. It's like he's thinking *'I was happy before you. Fat and happy. I stayed indoors where it was warm and my lily white feet knew only the soft embrace of the finest Persian rugs. But then . . . you came. Now I am ripped daily from my happy home and with my ever shrinking body I feel the bite of autumn's cold teeth. My feet are dirtied, dirtied by the harsh tap tap tap on concrete and the decaying bodies of once green leaves. As green and full of the warm sun's promise as my past was. One day I'll make you'll see. One day.'*
In the first pic he looks timid but now he has that smug ass look on his face like "yea, I look good." Too cute!!! You are a nice person!
Is there a sub for doggo progress pics?
From the look on his face, Buddy doesn't look enthused about his new fitness regimen.
If you cut his nails, he will have a lot more of an easier time to be active and stay active. He will also feel a lot more comfortable in general.
That’s awesome! Your neighbor might also consider feeding Buddy less, which will help him stay at a healthy weight.
I love this so much. Thank you.
Shameless plug here but I am in Atlantic Canada and volunteer for an organization called Elderdog. They pair seniors who have dogs with volunteers who walk them and play with them. I walk 2, sometimes 3, gorgeous dogs for a senior. If you live in At.Can, or even if you don't, look into organisations near you who may also do this. It's so rewarding and keeps seniors with their dogs longer.
Buddy has made some great dogress!
🎶 My Buddy and me! 🎶
In the first picture he looks self conscious and in the second one he looks all smug like ay I know I look good beeee
T H I C C  B O Y E
You are good people.
You rock! You are literally adding years back to Buddy’s life!
This has so many layers of sweetness.
How long do you walk him for? Did you have to gradually increase distance?
This is too awesome! You’re a great person!
He looks like he’s sick of your shit
That is awesome of you to help both of them!
That was very kind of you and I'm sure they both appreciate it a lot. Nice work
Holy shit how far did you walk him??
Good human does goodboy a help! Yesss.
Fat animals make me sad.Good work on giving him exercise!
How long do you walk him for? So cute
That’s so awesome man, glad to see upstanding people doing nice stuff sometimes. :)
He looks like he hates you
You are a really good person, OP! Thank you for caring for Buddy and also helping out your neighbor when she needed it! I hope you get lots of puppy kisses from Buddy!
I would like to see more posts like this.
and now they have a friend when the other one dies^^^apply ^^^that ^^^which ^^^ever ^^^way ^^^you ^^^like
This is more awesome than some of the success stories on /r/loseit. And much cuter.
Good boi gettin’ gains.
Bless him and bless you.
Damn that dog is thicc
This is so touching and inspiring. Thinking about doing the same thing for my niece's Guinea pig.
Way to go! You’re making a big difference in both of their lives, thank you!
Where's the picture of the comically oversized, former collar?
He needs a pair of sunnies
:)
You are so pure
This is the most wholesome and good deed I've seen on here. Good job! And congrats little pup!
This is prime /r/HumansBeingBros content right here.
Holy crap in a hat. That was one round doggo. Good job
That's so awesome!  I'm proud of Buddy and you! <3
[deleted]
That’s super awesome and kind-hearted of you to do!! You rock!!! Congrats on getting healthy Buddy!
Wow what a contrast between the two photos!Thanks for being a kind human.
I can only imagine your weight loss is just as good!When we set a goal, it's not the finish line, but what happens on the way there that has the most impact in our lives.  Great job!!!
This is so sweet. Applause for your selflessness.
This world needs more people to act like this
* Pic 1: "Do I really have to move for this 'walk'?"* Pic 2: "Oh my god, Karen if I have to take one more step..."
Why he looked pissed about the weight loss
YEEEY THANK TOU MAN ALL DOGS SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU
You deserve your impending gold, OP.
Good for you man :) I walk my friend's dog too, wish I had space for a doggo
Good for you.  Excellent results!
Aaaaaawwwwwwww. Happy pupper
He also changed from a dog to an opossum
This is the cutest thing!
I’m really touched by this. Thank you ❤️ Shine on
“What have you done to meeee!!!?!!!” Eyes right there
Wholesome
You are an awesome person. Please have lots of kids.
Based Buddy
Great post but I am laughing at the face on the dog now that he is in better shape and going on walks. He does. It look thrilled!!
He looks like he fucking hates you
Now he has kind of a badass look on his face too.
He looks pissed in the right photo
You are an awesome human being!
What's cuter than doggo? Healthy doggo!
That must have been one hell of a walk!
Thanks for being good hooman to buddy and your neighbor. <3
💝🐕
You are a good person.
Yaaay!
awesome work! he looks great
He looks like he hates you
Awww thank you for enriching this pups life and helping a senior!! ❤️
poor thing looks so old, thank you for doing such a thing ❤️
Thank you! For being a good neighbor and doing what needed to be done. That pup is their BF. How's the 90 yr old doing. I love older people.

Burrito to Egg Roll
he resents you so hard for it too, that is some vicious stink-eye
Chonk to chad

Fat pets like that break my heart. That is abuse!
The sad thing is that this is a form abuse even though unintentional due to the elderly owner not being able to walk, but there needs to be volunteer services for those animals.  If the elderly owner can't take care of himself then how the hell are they going to take care of a dog or cat if they can't even get out of the front door.  The sad thing is if the animal is taken away, the elderly owner will most be heartbroken since the dog or cat is their only companionship.
I'm glad you did it but honestly, the owner is to blame regardless of her age. She could have had someone all these years walk her dog.
Before Pic: "Get the fuck away with that leash.  I'm not going.  I hate you."After Pic: "You're still a dick... but thanks for saving my life."
Go Buddy and OP!!
r/AbsoluteUnits
2nd pic.  Little buddy is up to something. He's shifty.
I fucking love you for this OP
Go buddy go!
A simple act that seem nothing but has and will impact many (me included). Good karma will come to you.
Now we just gotta get people to do this
Thank you so much for helping this dog out. You make a huge diffrerence on his quality of life.
Probably saved this dog’s life!
Can you walk me?
Left: Sad little balloon!Right: Begrudingly admitting that maybe this walking thing is good for him.
His facial expression is priceless. "Y u do dis. But thx."
Proof that working out doesn't boost a dog's mood
He don't seem too proud to be slim. Must be crashing from all that cross fit bull shit
Alternative Title: Old lady commits animal abuse.
Good Hooman
You are a wonderful human!
What’s with old people and naming their dogs buddy? My great grandma had a dog named buddy
Bro buddy fuckin hates your ass
Cute little nugget!
You are a good person.
How is that the same dog
Buddy now has a jawline and resting bitch face
Lol. Looks healthier... And pissed!  I speak from experience, I exercised once - it was awful.
Buddy does not look amused.
Lol he looks absolutely miserable
And I hope you have added light to the neighbor's life.  My 84-year-old grandmother lost her dog it hurt her real bad. She missed having something around to talk to.

Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(
Nice
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
Good job OP in helping the dog out. You probably saved its life.Having said that, it actually really annoys me when old people insist on continuing to own dogs, when they clearly aren't able to look after them properly. Failing to have a dog walked is failing as a dog owner. Also that little dog was morbidly obese, which again indicates that the 90 year old owner was completely failing in their duty.I appreciate that old people can get lonely, and want company in the form of a pet, but this situation was still unacceptable. My advice to such dog owners, is to either get help if they're struggling, or consider being owned by a cat. Either way, they need to take responsibility, or not own a pet at all. /rant
People really shouldn't get pets when they're so old. It's not fair on the pets when they die and they get neglected in certain ways like this ): I'm happy you've helped her out like this though ! So kind
This warms my heart.
could be a sign of dementia or even alzheimers. my grandmother came to live with me and she kept over feeding my dog because he would beg for food and she could not remember he had already eaten. thankfully my little guy likes to chase other dogs along the fence so he ran the extra food off.
Jesus that poor dog thank you for helping him
That's animal abuse. If you can't take care of your pet, give it away.
You are awesome, your neighbor is a dog abuser. Just feeding him less would also make him not morbidly obese. I get being super old sucks, but this is animal cruelty.
Looks like a dog that barks at everyone and everything
That's animal cruelty. If you can't care for an animal, find a new home for it, where it can be much happier. "Years" is more than enough time to hire a dog walker.
Can you walk me, please? Thanks.
You are beautiful soul!
This blatantly looks like a meme.
In awe at the size of this lad.
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.
Dat face says I kill u I kill so dead

This is the sweetest! You’re an awesome human.
Awesome.   I'm sure you guys bonded as well.
Wholesome
You’re an awesome person, doing this for both your neighbor and for Buddy.
You're a good neighbor.
looking like an absolute unit on the left
It looks like a fat carry image photoshopped with a dog's head.
**from fluffo to buffo**
whyd you do it
Good hooman.
This made my day!!
You’re a great person for doing this! Thank you for helping that mutt out and increasing its quality of life.
Omg ur the best!! What a happy lil chi!
I'm sure he is happy to be outside but his better years are behind him inside of the house.
God bless you
Bet he is loving it too! Good for you, that's very kind of you.
You have given Buddy so many more years!! Hopefully he will live at least as long as your neighbor... by the time people get that old they end up losing people, pets etc all the time. Hopefully this is one less loss they will have to experience!!
Steph didn’t strike out this time. Steph hit a home run.
You gave them both a gift. The dog gets weight loss, and the owner gets to keep her dog longer.
You are so awesome helping out your senior neighbor and Buddy!
Thank you for being a good person ❤️
I started walking my 2 older chihuahuas with my new lab and they are looking really fit too! We're all getting in better shape. But I wish I'd taken a before and after of all of us first!
Loyal dog
You're the best kind of neighbor, one who cares.
He's got a whole new leash on life!
Absolute unit
He still thicc tho! 👌🏻
You're a good human. Thank you.
Absolute unit
You are the best hoooman in the world!
this is so pure. the content I need in my cynical existence
God bless you my dude
Sounds like a good deal!The dog gets walked and becomes healthier, and you get a dog to go outside with and start conversations.
Love the expression on the after picture. Before: I'm fat, but I'm fine.After: I fuckin' hate you Bob.
I used to walk my exes dog daily who is a corgi. Recently saw said dog and just about cried on how much weight she gained. Good on you OP for giving this pup some exercise!
r/progresspics
The only thing bigger than the poor puppy at the beginning is your heart ❤️ , well done you.
SO PROUD OF YOU AND BUDDY <3 <3 <3
Awww good on you. He looks so much better 😀
He looks high as hell in the second photo..
Youre a great person
The dog kind of looks like it resents you for it.
He went from potato to hot dog! If you keep it up he will reach noodle tier!
I wish I could be that good of an human being. Nice job op ❤️
r/humansbeingbros r/mademesmile
Well done,  OP. Fucking well done.
Love
Probably the best before/after comparison I ever saw
This is awesome
I’m certain he’s happy but that look on the second panel is like he’s judging you. “I used to have a nice life lounging around....”
That's so nice of you. He looks happier too.
That's very sweet of you, you are a kind person! Buddy looks great!
Major Karma points for you my friend.
You are a hero :)
You probably gave both of them more years together!
That is amazing! Good job, Buddy.
Awwwww!!!!
Looking good Buddy.
Everyone needs someone and it's so very cool to see that you were there for someone who needed it.
You absolutely beautiful human being.
What an incredibly kind thing for you to do for both the neighbor and the dog! ❤️
Great job!!
I might need you to start taking me for walks.
AWW! Give pls give him a cuddle for me 😍
Thank you for taking great care of this good boy!
Who a good human
You are a hero!
That's so kind of you!!
I've done that. Lots of elderly people in this neighborhood so I've walked their dogs.One pair of dogs I walked for three years. Really sad when they moved away. And now no one walks those dogs.
Delivered pizza for a living. Can confirm a lot of old people have an overweight pupper to greet you at the door.
He looks more miserable..
All good things considered, the after image looks like hes seriously gotten sick of your shit.
Sweet of you to help out.
Yeah, he looks thrilled.
Poor old lady and doggo. His mommy doesn't have the strength to walk him
Well done! You have a generous heart, to do this for Buddy and your neighbor.
You know she added you to her will ......your getting the dog <3
He looks pissed about it. “God damn, picking me up and taking me from my house can’t believe this shi- I’m out OF BREATH MELANIE OK”
Congrats to you and the dog. Looks like you both have had quite the transformations lately!
Buddy looks like a real chick magnet :)
well done! Other people may see it and turn a blind eye to it but you chose not to ignore it. My dad was 86 years old and he had neighbors who always looked out for him and it really give me peace of mind that they did I didn't live very far away and neither did my sister's so we were there often but we knew when we couldn't make it like an inclement weather that he could count on them to help him maybe shovel his driveway or you know just things like that for him and it made all the difference in the world
Can you take me for walks too, i need to lose weight 😂😂😂
Good lad. He's looking in great shape. Can't believe just how round he was before.
You ROCK!
He’s not your buddy, pal.
\>that expression in the second picture  You know he knows he's better and healthier, but he doesnt' like it and want you to know it
#TransfomarionTuesdayGood job!
I hope to have before and after photos like these
Exactly what I was expecting to see owned by a 90 year old lady.
Everyone should create an alt account to upvote this twice
No doubt both Buddy and his mama are happy to have you as a neighbor. He looks so much better!
Skinny boi
It might not seem like much but this favor has more impact than you might realize...You are keeping an elderly person’s companion healthy, happy and alive. It’s proven that elderly people can live longer and are happier when they have a beloved pet. She is probably so relieved that he gets exercise and I bet she enjoys seeing you too. It’s always great to take initiative and do a kind deed but you have taken this a step further.  You saw a simple way that you could help and committed to it! By doing so you’ve improved someone else’s (lady and dog’s) quality of life!
The second photo looks like Buddy's slowly realizing something about you. Like he was thinking about how much easier his life's been lately - being able to walk better, run again, and even jump onto the couch. And he thinks "Wait a minute, did this human teach me how to do these things again? Before I met her I'm sure I couldn't move so fast. It was you, wasn't it? My legs are better because of you, you sly dog."
What breed is that? It looks like a house elf.
since when did dogs master angling pictures?
The dog has the I rather be fat face
You're doing a great thing.
Love it! You're a good hooman
Hes makin nore progress than me. Good job lil buddy
That is so fucking nice of you. That's what's living is all about Helping those ones who can't do it. This makes me happy good job buddy!!!
Aww I hope you tell your neighbor that the internet loves her and her doggo!
He looks very polite in the one to the left.
I see two tails on the first photo. What happened to that one?
100k in 5 hours?! Holy shit.
Gj, but in some other states the police would have taken care of the issue by taking the dog from her.
i love you. you are a hero to me.
You're telling me getting out and moving made that dog lose weight?  I figured it needed a miracle product like fit tea or herbal life...
From thicc to slicc.
😭😭 poor doggie
This is so pure!
You’re a good person
Ok..time to start taking myself for walks and lose some of these extra lbs.Thanks for the inspiration Buddy!
This is lovely - you are a good human being! The idea of carrying Buddy partway and making him walk back is a great idea! Well done both!
We adopted a dog named Buddy when his human had to enter an assisted living facility.  He too was overweight and clumsy, but he's a new man these days.  Fit and agile and just the sweetest little guy.  He loves his new pack.
He looks very unamused at his progress
Hey man, can you walk me? I got 15 pounds I would like to lose.
Maybe added years to OP's life too.  Win, win.  Great Job!
Yeah he totally looks thrilled about it.
Such a wonderful thing you’ve done, both for the pup  and your neighbor.  I’ve done Meals on Wheels for years and there are so many elderly who are isolated. Sometimes the people who  are delivering meals might be the only people they see all week.  There so much kindness in what you’re doing.  Thanks for being a part of this world.
Buddy does not look amused.
From CHONK to HONK
Jeez all that weight after 1 walk? You're a miracle worker
Walking the dog and enriching his life is fantastic. Doing this for your neighbor, makes you an amazing human being! Way to be an awesome neighbor that I would be happy to live next to. Kudos!
Now this is worthy of 100 Up votes! 🙏🙏🙏
You are a great person! Xoxo
Right on OP! Super nice for your to do for the dog and your neighbor.
May I be next?
I would love this arrangement.  I get a dog to walk but I don't have to be home by a certain time to let him/her out to pee :-)
That's absolutely adorable
I wonder if he saved his skinny jeans
Dude, nice.  I can definitely see those jaw gains and the lats are doing well too.  What body fat percentage is your dog?  Also, how much does he bench?  I'm trying to achieve that same ripped physique.  Can you also provide a diet plan?  Thank you so much.
Buddy doesn't looked too thrilled!
Thanks for helping out. I had to take a dog from a senior who could no longer care for their dog. She weighed 26 lbs. She lost 6.lbs and fits in with my other three dogs. She is now loving and happy. It makes me happy whenever I look at her. You’ll benefit from your efforts.
Can you walk me?
Buddy looks like he’s seen some shit
This is so amazing!Congrats!/r/HumansBeingBros
Aw, he looks fantastic! You’re a good person for doing this. My Nan is 76 and my brother walks her dog three times a week. The vets are pleased with her weight loss and the movement helps her tired old bones, plus she gets out of the house for half an hour to smell all the smells. I’m so glad there are good people out there to help animals.
Are these nails supposed to be cut?
Thank you for loving animals 🐢❤️
You’re a good person. I salute you
You rock!
This is beautiful. Well done you and well done Buddy! Such a gorgeous little face!
Do you also walk the bunnies in your avi?  I know someone w a rabbit named Kevin and I’m still not over it.  Like, I think ab Kevin the rabbit at least 4x  a week
Buddy looks tired of your shit. Or maybe he's just tired.
Such a precious nugget. So kind of you to help your neighbor and Buddy <3
I’m shocked the bot didn’t jump in to say “THIS LOOKS LIKE A PROGRESSION PIC”
Wow all in one walk
Awwwww, good for you...Proud of you!
Yay!
Buddy doesn't look too happy about it
Felicidades!.
Cute
Neighbours have a golden. She's old and adorable and I've never seen her be walked in the year we've lived in this house. I want to so badly to offer to walk her! They've got kids at an appropriate age to walk her too. She's always running across the street to the field and wants to play. It breaks my heart.
How nice!
Well done.
Hi Buddy. You are sooo handsome. Congrats on your weight loss. I just fell in love with a guy named Buddy.
Great job, dudette
Love this x
That 2nd photo of though... "bitch took my food from me".
This makes me so happy! That’s so kind of you.
Good hooman
And mental health.
Is that a cat's tail in the first pic?Are you not walking the cat?
150k Upvotes in 13 hours, wow.
You are doing god's job, son
He did look happier when fat tho. Or maybe you walked him too early on the morning.
I used to have a Chihuahua that really loved it when we would take her out for walks but hated actually walking because she would get tired because she was incredibly fat, and she wouldn't lose weight. She passed away because some stomach problems caused by her love for food that was meant for a way bigger dog we had and depression by being separated 😅
This has got to be the most wonderful short story I've read today. Thank you for this, OP. Buddy, in his second pic, looks like he doesn't want to participate in everything you put him through, but I'm sure he's happy. Such a cute dog! p.s. Have his owner cut his nails.
Don't use this word lightly, but true Hero.
Awww look at the little sausage
Buddy looked like a giant tick w/ four legs but now looks so much healthier.
Good hooman and pupper
Kudos....I think you did a really kind act that was giving both to your neighbor and the little doggie. I wish my neighbors were so nice!
He doesn't look so happy about it ...
I wish someone made me go for walks lol
That dog doesn't look happy about the diet :D
Thank you for stepping up!! <3
Thank you for doing a kind deed today ❤️
🎶I’m too sexy for this leash!🎶
My dog loves human scraps and gets into the cats food all the time, I think the only reason she's a skinny bitch is because I walk her excessively, but where as that works for her it has not worked for me, lol dog metabolisms are next level.
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.&#x200B;&#x200B;
I read it like “she hasn’t walked the dog in 90 years” 😂😂
/r/dogresspics if you want even more looted karma
You are a supreme human being!
#THIS MAKES ME SO FUCKING HAPPY
You are the bestest good grrl person ever!!
Hey can you help me next?
I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but this is one of the reasons old people shouldn't have pets that they can't fully take care off themselves
Are you sure it wasn't just a big ugly domesticated rat?
What an asshole if you can’t walk your poor dog have someone do it for you that’s not fair for buddy :(
r/progresspics
From R O U N D  B O I to L E A N  B O I.
Thats one fat sumbitch
That is why old people should not have young dogs, they should have like a parrot or a cat
so you're saying that a little activity goes a long way? That can't be. Weight loss is more than eating less and moving more! That dog has outstanding genes! Or maybe the dog is doing keto and intermittent fasting. Do you add apple cider vinegar into the dog's water to melt the fat off? Is the dog following an organic, clean diet? How long it took you to detox the dog? /s
He's not fat. Just big boned
I know that it’s terrible for their health but fat animals are cute af
Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(
On the left: happy and chubby On the right: "it's 95° out Steph where are my dammed biscuits?!"
Thank you! From all the dog lovers in the world, especially the dog lovers that need extra help to keep our pups healthy.
/r/dogresspics
Wow, awesome. This is great. Taking care of elders and animals. Good for you, OP. My faith in humanity has increased in ratings.
That dog looks 90 years old
This works for humans too....get off your ass and move more if your overweight
Holy fuck that dog looks like a snake after a huge mealI have one similar to it but she refused to walk on the leash so she just collects mass, pretty soon we're gonna start to orbit her :(
Heckn good looking
I hate to write it, but...she really should think of allowing you to adopt her dog.  She can't help her dog be healthy anymore, it's time to give him to someone that can.
You shouldn't own a fucking dog if you refuse to walk it, really is sad when people abuse their pets like this, being old isn't an excuse either, you can get a mobility scooter and have him walk along side...
You saved life of this dog. Lool at him and his over weight. You give him more years for live. Im so proud on you. Thanks for saving dog. Who have this dog is 100% no lifer or he does not have heart for animals. Dog is so polite. He does not seen nature many years.
Are you positive his name isn't [Ferdinand](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tomandjerry/images/c/cf/Tom_and_Jerry_The_Movie_-_Ferdinand_holding_Jerry.png/revision/latest?cb=20150414015354)?
You go girl
He looks peeved at you
Nice, especially nice.
Your a good boy/girl, strikoutsteph.
That’s the best thing for a dog. A walk, daily, if not two or three times.
Awk them ears!
Apparently it helped you lose weight too
Posts like this make me proud to be human!
Just out of curiosity, what breed is that dog? It’s just so adorable 😍😍
r/progresspics
TBH he looks more proud in the first picture lol
M
Where did Buddy go number 1 and 2 at before?  Just wherever in the house?
What breed is this? Its cute but also kinda oddlooking.
Buddy in the second photo kind of looks like Ethan from H3H3
OP did something good. Give gold guys.
Awwwwww go you and buddy! It is so nice to see someone do something for someone that is completely selfless
Awwwww. You added years to that baby’s life. Kudos to you and that hard working Buddy! 💖
You’re a good person.  Buddy is a lucky dude!
A very sweet and nice
Now that’s a glowup!
This is a great way to show the elderly we care. Great idea and blessings upon you for your kindness.
WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THIS?! 😱
Great job! You probably added a few years to this dog's life span. Also, is this Austin, bc that dog looks super familiar to me?
Thank you for being a great human!
Aww so glad for Buddy! He probably feels a lot better!
Buddy is a good boy.
You can post the before pic on r/absoluteunits

Great work !
As well you should be. Good for you for being such a good neighbor.
Damn i told myself i'd have a transformation picture like this dog by the end of the summer smhh might be too late
Aww buddy looks great and so much happier! Thank you for sharing this. This is the kind of stuff we need more of!
We're proud of you! Buddy
Also - I like how in photo 1 - Buddy’s tail is in front of him but also TRAILS OFF BEHIND HIM. Honestly - there is some sci-fi shit going on with this dog. Side note - Good work OP. He looks awesome.
Well done!
Why is he giving you the stink eye?
Come walk me my trainer sucks
Look at that boy. Just look at that boy. He is my buddy too.
You are seriously the best kind of person. Keep doing that you’re doing.

Whats the time difference between the two pictures OP?
Awesome!
It still looks equally as upset with you as before.  Where do you think it got that face from?
this first picture looks like he's worried you're going to take him on a walk. the second pic looks like his fears were confirmed.
This is the real shit. Thanks OP ❤
I love buddy!!!!
That’s awesome. Nice job.

He looks happy, like he knows he looks good. Should also post on progress subreddit

Is the owner Russian or Ukrainian?
He has yoda ears
You're a wonderful person, in my book. Thanks for spreading some kindness in this cruel world.
I have this same problem. Will you come walk me?
Thats what happens when you visit grandma.

Such an awesome person you are to help that sweet little pupper and their hooman!!
Your dogs must be pumped about his existence. "Look, there goes Buddy on a walk with OUR hooman."
This is hysterical. There is a woman that just moved on my block who also had a horribly obese dog named buddy, also owned by her mom who couldn't walk him. I get to watch his weight loss each walk. I should have thought of a before/after photo, because man is that one MASSIVE dog.
Is it just me or is he giving us the look at my new sexy body look on the right pic?
I'd crosspost this on /r/loseit ;)
So nice of you!!!!
This is a transformation story I can get behind lol way to go Buddy !!!
That's awesome of you!
Adorable
Go Buddy Go! 👏
 I read that as 90yo dog at first. But that’s awesome, I’m sure he’s much more comfortable with some of that weight off him. Such a cute pup!
Good job buddy!
This guy walks
Great positive influence in the world!!
Damn, how far did you walk? ;)
So sweet
r/progresspics
OP your an awesome dude!
Dog's best friend. Nicely done.
You are an amazing person OP!
Thank you for adding years to his life, and saving him from knee and back problems ❤️❤️ also a nice little visit for your neighbor every day. You’re a good soul ❤️❤️
He doesn't seem very proud though.
Before he was an absolute unit. Now hes just a lil chub.
This is the best post I have seen on Reddit this week, thank you OP for being a brilliant human being
No one else noticing the dog giving him the stink eye? He's like "why did you make me do this, I'm now gonna freeze to death cus i have no hibernation flubber"
Buddy is a Relative Unit now.
Face gainz!OP, you are a good soul. May the Universe bless you.
r/AbsoluteUnits
Good on you!
Dog's are awesome. Life is simple for them, and caring for them reminds me of the simplicities in life we take for granted.
 long nails!
Also I'm sure the neighbor appreciates having some one stop by so that it something happens some one can at least call for help.
You're so awesome! You're helping both doggo & human ( both you & the dog owner)😁
He’s looks like he hates you for it. Good job helping him out!
Needs more spray tan in second pic
Can you take me out for a walk from time to time?
Buddy aged.
Awww, little guy was plump as a pickle
Brøthêr may ī havæ the lööps
He looked happier while he was fat
haha he looks pissed you got him off his ass. I wonder if a pampered fat dog really cares if they’re fat, not like they’re getting laid.
How old is he?
Thank you so much for this, you have extended Buddy's life and made it a happier one too.
you are a Super Hero!!! yay!
She reminds me of my little Micah Sue. I got her from my mil and she was SO fat! She lost a bunch of weight,but she remained chunky until she passed. She was the friendliest dog ever and I miss her sweetness so much
You look great Buddy
U rock
The dog looks sick wtf Did you do to it?
Must've been a long walk!
This should be under “humansbeingbros” subreddit as well.
r/progresspics is quaking!
Someone please do this to me
His eyes just shine with gratitude lol
Do you know how much weight he lost? He looks so great! You are a wonderful human for doing this.
I like how you serve the community. Thank you.
Op thank you for being a good human.
Can you take me out for a walk?
r/absoluteunits
My 40yo able-bodied neighbor with an even more able-bodied teenage son hasn’t mowed their lawn in years, come mow their grass!
OP, you are Awesome.
Coincidentally, i also have a small dog named Buddy, but he loves walking; It's our other female small dog that is lazy and fatter
You are amazing for doing that.  It makes such a difference in their lives.One thing though, if he is gaining weight without being walked, he is eating too many calories.  Advise the owner to check with their vet on how many calories he needs at a resting rate.  From there the vet can advise on how much food when walking.  Also no treating outside those calories.
Is your neighbor dog actually buddy? I'm just asking cause back when I was a kid my first dog I named buddy as well 🤣Miss that good lazy boy
Snoop Dogg, is that you?
Go buddy!
I need more people like you in my life. People who care about others.
Consider that dog yours.
Wow! He looks great! Awesome job!
Amazing! I tried crossposting this to r/progresspics for a little bit of fun (crediting you and this post of course), but their stipulations made it difficult (title must be in format "F or M/age/height/200lbs > 140lbs = 60lbs Weight loss progress." Anyway, if you can figure all that out it might be some easy karma!
Poor dog
Buddy’s face doesn’t look like he enjoyed the weight loss
😇😇😇
Wow dude, that's really considering of you. Buddy's looking great!
Aww what a goooooood booooooy he loves u sm now!!!
Great job Buddy and To You for your dedication and selflessness!!! We need good stories like these:-)^_^
That's a hot dog
That dog just wants to smoke a blunt and watch Clifford
Looks like an old dog can learn a few new tricks ! If by a kind helping hand (:
Daaaaaamn
He's got that old man grumpy face lol"I'm doing this for her not for you..l
Good boye does a thiccoms
Fitboye
You should post this to r/progresspics I have a male mini dachshund that went through a weight transition and his photos got a lot of karma (alt account). He went from 23 to 12 pounds, needless to say, our fur babies are way happier and healthier!
Good boys!!!
He looks slightly suspicious of you.
why does no one asked where he went to the toilet all those years?
You are good human. A very good human.
Absolute Unit
I love there are people like you!!! ❤❤Good human!!!!
You are a good neighbor/person!!!
Good for you OP. That dog would thank you if it could talk.
Good human.
He looks so mad. Maybe he was happy with who he was? You ruined him.
You’re good people
He looks the same
When my old roommate and I moved into together, I started walking his elderly dog, which I don’t think had happened in years.  This dog went through a crazy transformation.  He wasn’t fat to begin with, but he did build some impressive muscle.  It was the happiest I’d ever seen him.  Even when he was inside he was more active— he didn’t just sit around anymore.  Cocoa died 3 months after I moved out.
Nice bro.
You are a good person.
I love that you carried him out.  I knew people who had a dog who wouldn't want to walk out but would walk home, so they used a baby stroller to get him to the walk point. He sat so nicely in it and it was canopied so you wouldn't know a dog was in there instead of a baby until you got close. Surprise!
Herbert?
He even looks like he's smiling again. At least as much as a feisty chihuahua would. :)Well done, OP.
>!You are an angel.!<

Omg so precious
Good for you OP!

Buddy looks high AF in the second pic
That was one hell of a walk!
He looks proud too, good job

That’s lovely! Well done 👍
That is so sweet
He looks resentful
G O O D F A T B O Y
Thank you for being such a good person!   It's lovely to see and it makes me feel happy!   ❤️
You’re a badass OP
GG You have your place in heaven because of that Work :D My friend
This SO made my day!!!!
Anyone else notice how resentful he looks after the transformation? lol
You’re a saint.Thanks for doing this.
That is a look of hatred if I have ever seen one 😂
On the right he looks like "enough walking already jfc"
You are a good man.
/r/progresspics
You’re an amazing human being.
God bless you
I LOVE YOU, BUDDY! ❤️
How long did this transformation take? Did the owner change his diet at all?
That dog looks so pissed off
Reminds me of my aunt's fat ass jack Russell
r/Redditorsbeingbros
Dude looked like a chinchilla.
Where... where would he poop before?
Good job
Thank you for your service!💗💗👏👏
he looks so much younger, even with the grey hairgj
Amazing!
Lol I don't think he's grateful
Man, this is just really fucking awesome.
He looks way healthier but not happier
CUT HIS NAILS THO
That is so awesome you did that for your neighbor's dog! He really needed the exercise! Buddy looks great!
Aww 💕 so wholesome
He looks pissed that you walked it
[Oh you](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/390/ohyou.jpg)
Oh so sweet
From bowling ball to geriatric doggy, great job you two!

Amazing!!! I bet he loves it.
Ferda, buddy
I love this post. Mate your an absolute legend!!
Ya done good.
You're a good dude, dude.
I've got a fat raccoon you're welcome to walk if you want 😀
Oh my good you're a freaking angel
My heart.
Heart = warmed Youre great.
r/absoluteunits
The little guy must love you for it!!!  And I'm sure your neighbor loves your visits as well!
Aww sweet little buddy!
Thank you!!!!!! We need more of you in the world!! When I was a home hospice caregiver all of my clients pets were horribly out of shape because they weren’t capable of walking them :(. So amazing of you to step up, keep being the best!!!!
You are a good person. ❤️🐶
You rock OP.
OP you’re a good person.
Lip
I'm sure Buddy is greatful for you kindness. You're a nice hooman.
Jesus. I’m surprised the dog let itself get that fat. If I haven’t walked my dog, he will just sprint around the yard chasing flies until he gets out all of his wiggles
Oh I guess Buddy loves his new body :)
I believe this is what you call a certified good boy
Thank you being a wonderful person.
I have a two year old rescue who is terrified of the leash-erupts into shakes when I even take it out.  Have tried just about everything-and she’s getting fat because I can’t figure out how to walk her.  We went to a trainer who suggested giving her treats while wearing the leash, putting her leash near her food, etc but she still hates it.  Any advice would be appreciated!
Good person you are.
You are an angel!
Looks like he could use a Mani Pedi too! Could be wrong though I don't own a dog 😋
Modern day hero.
Nice!
r/absoluteunits
Thank you!
why do I feel bad when I see fat dogs and cats.
First photo: fat and happy; Second: lean and mean
My Daughter and son in law got a Australian Shepherd puppy. They both work, so I go over Monday through Friday and train and walk her@ 3  /  1/2 yr old pup. Can do these things : sit, stay, heel, shake both paws, lay down, roll over, crawl, come when called and she will lay down off to my side while I get her food and I place her food bowl down and she sits until I say go eat. Train them young, they’re like sponges.Great job on the weight loss on that older dog.Keeping an older dog fit is extremely important! What you did will make the dog healthy, but also getting more time with his best friend.I’m over doing my message, but that’s what dog lovers do!!

Awe he looks so cute and gentle! And it's really good you're helping your neighbor walk her dog what a good improvement!
You are amazing!
This is a wonderful thing, makes me really happy to read this! For how long have you walked Buddy?
I’m so proud!
We need more people like you OP, thank you for this kindness
He's kinda smirking in the second pic
Everyone looks fatter when they sit down thoo lol
Dobby is free elf now.
Fucking yay! BUDDYZ!
Good for you!  The world needs more people like you!
Buddy now has a look of confidence/subtle arrogance rather than concern in his face.Good on you...
Not all heroes wear capes.
Weight loss and a dog...welcome to the top
What a transformation! 👍🏼
There's a special place in heaven for you.
Awesome :)
That's nice. Everyone needs to exercise and see new things. It's good for his physical and mental health.
You should take her to be put down........the 90y/o not the dog
You're an awesome human!
(Sigh) what a guy/girl!
Not going for walks is a problem, but the dog's weight problem is on his diet. He probably eats too much or people give him junk food.

Giving Melania WAY too much credit there...
How long did it take from 1st pic to the 2nd? Year or months or weeks? Have no idea how it is for a dog :)
Dog loses weight.
really nice of you
You are a good person.
Can't people just do something nice and never tell anyone about it? I dare any of you.
He is not impressed tho. 'Weirdo humans always with their weird ideas'.
Is there another dog or cat in the first pic? I see a tail...
Proud of you a s human!
Got to love pet owners who can’t be responsible for them.
I love how the dogs of old people look like old people. The second pic is such a perfect hide-the-pain old person smile.
I'm gonna cry.
You’re an angel.
Aww cute little guy
Glo up
You made my day!
His expression though in the one where he's on the leash says he hates you
You don’t necessarily have to walk a dog to keep its weight in check.  It’s all about proper amount of food to feed.  Either way, good on you for making him healthier.
How long between pictures? And that's an amazing thing you did 😀
I've never seen something so wholesome.
An absolute unit
He looked happier before
Wholesome
The world needs more people like you.
You are a good person , that's for sure!
Buddy appreciates this more than you know! Thanks on his behalf... Your a good person
Thank you for doing this. You’re a true angel!!
 H guy I'll 8N
TIL:  I should walk myself.
You are a really nice person to do something nice like that. God Bless
You are an earth angel. God bless.
So how fat is your neighbor?
I know he's healthier but in the second pic he has the "I'm already sick of this shit" face
Yes!
You just added years to his life, nice job.
Well keep the good work and soon he'll be at his healthy BMI 😀
I live in an older neighbourhood, I wonder if there's money in this...
absoluteunit.jpg
Should probably post this on r/progresspictures
Awww hims is a little lump, but I’m glad he lost weight!
Yesssss 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
I hope your neighbour's doing ok, seeing as she hasn't took her dog for a walk in a while.
Nice
That's so kind of you :) Heartwarming to see how much healthier he is, he looks like a very sweet dog ♡
That dog looks like it went through a tour in Vietnam in the second picture.
nice job bro
Lose up to 30 pounds WITHOUT dieting - you’ll NEVER believe what she looks like now
this is the cutest ever<3
Buddy went from Meme to Lean.
He doesn't look any happier
Where is the progress flair
Why does he look like he’s about to cry.
You have a big heart
Good on you OP! Keep being an excellent person.
Dude you are a good human!
God bless you, the old lady, and her dog.
A good caption goes a long way.
This makes me very happy.  Best thing ive seen on the internet today. thanks!
Lol, I love the dogs look after the weight loss. It's that, "I see what you tricked me in to" look.
If he isn't an absolute unit anymore, does that make him a /r/relativeunit?
lol the dog is looking at you like imma kill you in your sleep
Wow!!! Great job. 👍🏼
what an absolute unit!
A buddy named Buddy. Well put
Good for you! He looks bitter about it though haha
Great job op
Great work ! 1000 karma-points
That lad is an absolute unit
Awesome job on saving the dog (and owner) from a premature pup death. The dog is very cute super fat. Something about overweight animals charms the pants off me. They can't(shouldn't be) overweight, but when they are it's sadorable.
His fur even got a tan! Haha! Nice job!!!
After he should be able to walk u..😁
Now you inherit a dog
This is from the bottom of my heart guys. I really don't get how so many people are moved (me included) by this dog probably gaining a few years, but eat pigs and other virtually similar beings and 3 meals a day
The dog might out live the owner now
OMG IM SO PROUD OF BUDDY
Good for Buddy!!!
ProgressPics
Faith in humanity restored
He probably feels like a new man!
God bless you
You have done something amazing my friend God Bless you
he looks like he's having a meltdown in the second picture, unfortunately.
Thank you for looking out for your elderly neighbor. I’m sure it means so much to her.
Those are happyboy eyes, kudos op
what a fuckin' cutie!
Wow what a good person you are. I hope good things come your way.
Either fake or a girl needing attention for a good deed
He needs a pair of sunnies
Aww..little buddy is doing great! So cute..love this.
MOOD!
I can’t tell you how happy this makes me. I always feel sorry for dogs being loved to death.
In awe at the size of this lad...
Buddy looks like an arsehole
Pic on the right looks like he wants to die
So awesome that you did this!!! It’s not often enough that people in my generation(‘86) do things like this. It seems like most younger people cannot be bothered to help or even interact with the people around them. Great job helping him out!
That is a lot of karma
Share it in /progresspics
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this but you not only helped him out physically but mentally as well. Dog's need to be walked. There is no activity that can replace that. Just letting them in the back yard is not the same mentally as walking is. Granted Buddy is old and doesn't need much anymore but for younger dogs this can be detrimental to their development.In Buddy's case, this small bit of exercise probably made him feel more "dog" that he has in a while and I bet he is more active around the house and not just sitting there like a sausage.Good on you. Now just get those nails clipped!
Want to post this to /r/prawwgresspics too? That sub could use some love.
You are a wonderful person! How did you approach the subject?
You are amazing!!
You are doing a wonderful thing for both the neighbor, and the dog. She has someone checking in on her regularly, and the dog gets some fresh air and sunshine. Plus, Buddy probably feels much better than he did before.
My dog was named buddy
What if the dog liked being able to roll around?
I have the same carpet
Big unit to healthy unit
She probably fed him once every second day
whoag
One simple act of kindness and you gave that dog its life back and brought happiness to a senior citizen. One simple act of kindness can change so much.
That was one thicc dog
your doing gods work
Awwwww
is this loss
Very good job! Movement is so Important for him
Such a cute weight loss story, so nice of you to help out! Although, I have to admit I'm kind of jealous of Buddy, I want someone to successfully convince me to exercise!
r/fitness and r/brogress
This is truly a long game for karma, and it paid off...for you and the doge.
that thing looks young
It looks like you’ve posted a progress pic this r/aww
Fit boye
I don't know you, but I am sure proud of you ❣
This dog
Lol he looks kinda mad in the second pic but much healthier. I bet the woman and her pup really appreciate it.
Good for you and for Buddy!
He looks depressed now
I'd give you gold if I could my friend !
Jesus christ, the poor thing...
This is incredible. That dog's quality of life just shot up thanks to you.
What breed is he?
I wish I could marry a girl like you OP
It’s hard being 90
It looks like a super cool dog!
You're a great human! This fills me with joy. (:
#ketolife lol
You’ve done good. Society Thanks you.
This is the most wholesome post I’ve ever seen on reddit. I love old dogs!
How old is he?
Where did he go to use the bathroom before that?
This is awesome. Good on you.
I lol'ed then I felt bad then i loled again.
My mom needs to do the same thing
That musta been a LOT of poop!
Buddy looks absolutely disgusted with you
That's so sad! I'm glad you are doing the good deed! So awesome!
This is amazing, heck yeah op you probably gave him a few more years of life and  it probably makes his owner so happy.
He's one skinny boi now
You are fucking awesome 👌
Haha such a fat cute doggy
Thank you so much for doing this, you are wonderful person.  How much did he weigh when you started and how much does he weigh now?  Give the good boy some green beans (amazing "treat" for weight loss, canned pumpkin too) from me!
So wonderful!!  What a great person you are!! ❤️
I'm sorry if someone already asked, but how long did this take?
Awesome
This is so sweet, the world needs more of you OP!
Buddy has Yoda ears
Is it just me or does the after picture make the dog look like he is really pissed?
Can you stop by and walk me too... I am in big need!!
Such a nice thing to do
Kind of off topic, but how do I convince my mom to buy real dog food for our dog? I'm getting worried because I know breaded chicken patties can NOT be good for him.
He looks tired
Lol what a fat bastard. I actually like the old pic more
That’s awesome
I love you for this.
What a good boy
That second pic is the look of satisfaction, if I ever.
It looks like there is another dog in the first picture, what happened to that one?
I see the tail of another dog! What about that one!?
My 85 year old grandparents had a dog named Buddy that died from complications of diabetes. I remember when I was younger I was doing yard work for them as a part time job and my grandmother would make me lunch. One day I went in to see a sandwich and she was cooking bacon. I was pumped and was like "oh I love bacon on my sandwiches." To which she responded "Oh... I can make more, this bacon is for Buddy." The poor dog was basically a round table near the end.
That dog hates you.
aww such a good heart
thank you for taking the time :)
What a good pupper
Wow! That is so awesome!! 🙂
Buddy looks like he is sick of your bullshit.JK: you are a good neighbor
What a great transformation!! Goes to show that it starts with a simple walk
Dog: ( he-help me.)
Thank you for being a good human
How long was this transformation?
that’s awesome. my grandma lived alone in her latter years and was unable to walk her dog buddy. fortunately there was a young neighbor fella who would do it for her. they actually became friends and would watch baseball games together.
Put this on r/loseit!
You've done this fellow a good service!
You are so cute!
Wow, you’re a saint. Unfortunately some old folks end up “accidentally” neglecting their pets. Thanks for paying attention and stepping up for the little guy. That made my day.
Thank you very much for doing this,we need more people like you...proud of body,he is so cute!!
You are an incredible person. Do you have your own Buddy? If not, get ready!

Excellent human being! This dog loves you so much for it.
What kinda dog??????
Ironically, he looked happier in the picture of when he was fat haha
What is the furry thing on the left though?
You’re awesome
so proud of your support!!!! good samaritan points filling your goblet of good!!!
Crosspost this to r/progresspics
This is everything! Thank you for doing this!
Dang I thought the pic on the left was pikachu
It looks like he despises you though.
Can you take me next?
jesus poor guy. dogs need walks. not like human need dogs exist for walks, this dog wouldve been depressed as fuck.
I used to know a dog named buddy, he too was pretty obese and old; the owner himself could barely walk most of the time, and the dog sadly died to some form of cancer afterwards ;(It hurt seeing a creature in so much pain.
That’s sweet thank you for helping Buddy and your neighbor
Love that the before photo is like “oh god don’t look at me”
Thank you!
It’s 4:33pm PST and this is the best thing I’ve seen all day.
Oh my word my heart!! Thank you for doing this!!!
This is a wonderful idea and good for everyone!
I gotta ask, how did you get him in there?
Spaghetti looks like a very civil serpent.
[removed]
I wanna see that in action
Although he's cold blooded, he probably finds that it feels very safe and maybe the fuzziness feels good too.  He might find it a fun little hiding sleeve, or he might actually find it comfortable.  I think he's adorable!  Merry Christmas!
Spaghetti is a perfectly appropriate name for a danger noodle.
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
Snekologist here. This is actually very bad for the snek. It instills an unrealistic fashion sense potentially causing fabulousness. The snek will demand more and more finely tailored garments until it enters a  state of being utterly and completely fabulous. By this time it's too late. The owner has gone bankrupt by now and the snek wears only Armani. The snek will Constantly demand that you get Armani on the phone.
Can he slither with it on? It looks like he would slide out.
My cornsnake's name is Ziti!
Snuggly snek
Holy Crap!I didn't expect this post to blow up like it did. My sister just learned how to crochet about a month ago and she made me this for Spaghetti. Best gift ever!On behalf of Spaghetti, Thank you so much! And thanks again for the gold! Completely unexpected.Thank you! This made my Christmas!
Aw, Spaghetti is a cute name for a snake!
Spaghettis lookin a little al dente
I like that you named your cat spaghetti
WARM LONG BOYE
 Coziest. Danger noodle. Ever.
Aww! I made my little corny a few hats before. His name is Ekans. :)
My name is relevant.
*Theres a snake in my sweater already**His name's Spaghetti*
Ok... I hate snakes and that's the cutest damn thing I've ever seen. Bonus cute points for naming a snake Spaghetti.
My noodles name is Spaghetti too! She's a girl though, and she doesn't have a sweater
So cute, too bad sweaters don’t work on snakes ;) 🐍
I hate snakes but this is so cute I can’t believe it.
Science question: Do sweaters keep sneks warm? Since they’re cold blooded, do they generate enough heat (or any, but they must generate some heat I think...) to be warmed by a sweater?
Lookssss like he apresssssssiatessss the nissssse insssssulation.
Spaghetti’s stomach muscles might not be able to get traction with his new sweater. So he may be in full “Well, I guess this is my life now,” mode haha.
If snakes had hair, this is how I imagine it would look like
Dude, she just made the arm part.
i think /r/snakes would appreciate this
Would a sweater work for cold blooded animals? Would it be any warmer?
my nem is snekn wen it’s cold christmas will comeso ive been toldI luv my mumshe get me gifts da fam does tooour spirits lifts my blood is coldmy heart is notI gets a giftI luvs a lot is made of yarn I crawl inside christmas is nice this I decide
The best time to wear a snake sweater... is all the time!
Normally snakes scare the shit out of me but it's so hard to be afraid of a lil guy named spaghetti with big sparkling eyes wearing a sweater his aunt made himIt's the end of the world. I love this little guy. Give spaghetti a kiss on the head for me.
How did you get it on him?
Idk how you got that on him, I feel like if I tried to put a sweater on my corn snake she wouldn’t be too happy about it lol.
Who needs spag bol when you have the spag boi?
🚫👞🐍
I want my name to be spaghetti
Omg
Can he still slither?
What kind of death noodle is that?
Literally a danger noodle with the right name.
You have a meme snek
But where are the arm holes?!
Read that as "Made a sweater from spaghetti" Surprised but not disappointed
I think Lowly Worm had a sweater like that.
background on snake?
I loathe snakes. But I ❤️seeing this snek in its sweater.
Was it a total surprise? Did she contact you ahead of time and ask how long Sketti is? Or did she come over with a tape measure and you ask "what are you doing with mah snek?" And she said, "oh nothing..."I have a pretty bad fear of snakes. I'm working on it though. Your sweet baby is awfully cute in that sweater.
Aww. Not aww, but a snake shat on me once while I was holding it. Sprayed bile-looking stuff and bits of bones all over me. Perhaps the sweater can double as a diaper?
There’s a children’s book (it’s very old and maybe out of print) called Crictor. It’s about a boa constrictor whose owner knits him a sweater to wear just like this! It was one of my favorite books as a little girl and my daughter now loves it too :) Such a cute snake and sweater
Good Snek.
Idk what’s better...a snake named Spaghetti or a sweater made for a snake ❤️
Nah not at all lol. It's more of a tube for him to just park in, it doesn't really effect him all that much, he slithers right out of it when he's bored
Many of my family members were slaughtered by this beast, do not trust snek!
If snakes are cold blooded. Is the sweater actually providing any utility for spaghetti? Isn’t the whole point of sweaters to trap body heat radiated form a persons own body?
Hey everyone!I wanted to thank you so much for sending Spaghetti some love for Christmas, I can't believe how much this thing blew up. I ended up doing an interview with The Dodo this morning. Completely blew my mind. Thanks again, it's really been a fun ride.Here is a link to the interview if anyone wanted some backstory on Spaghetti and his sweater!https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/pet-corn-snake-gets-christmas-sweater
*You named the snake Spaghetti*  *You named him after spaghetti*  Aww
I don't even like snakes but this is adorable.
What type of snek is this?
How does the snake move without sliding right out of the sweater?
Danger noodle has a danger sock now.
I don’t know what I love more; the fact that the snake is wearing a sweater or the fact that his name is Spaghetti.
Long ass rice
Turtlesnek
He looks happy.
That is the best name for a snake I ever did hear.
Are snakes able to recognize people?
I just thought about if there is any poisonous snake similar to yours and comes in front of you, how would you know which one is yours?
I wanted a bunny rabbit, I was gonna name it Nathan... that's Latin for 'warm' by the way... Nathan Scott Phillips..
Came here expecting Eminem lyrics. Was moderately dissapointed
You get an upvote just for naming your snake “Spaghetti”
Seems like your corn snek evolved into a 'carpet' snek :)
It’s pronounced Ssssssspaghetti, right?
What kind of snake is spaghetti?
That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Your sister is awesome!
Are pet snakes affectionate or are they just like "You're cool" to their owners?
I hate snakes.Can I hug it?
The real question though... is it a scarf a sweater or a onesie?

whoathe video of this is #9 trending on youtube right now.i don't think i've seen an actual interesting minute-long video from a real-life person on the trending section in like 5 years. it's always filled with late night tv show host garbage, 25 minute vlogs by 30 year olds that are marketed to children, and an occasional rap video.Come with me and be awed by this.
So not a turtleneck?
He just crawls out of it on his own. It's not stuck to him (no arms to hold it on!)
Cute and eleguant
Does it... Is a turtleneck sweater?
Spaghetti is literally the best name for a snake ever. I don’t like snakes but a snake named spaghetti makes me wish I had a snake and named it spaghetti.
" I enjoy this, human"
I guess he likes to slytherin...i will see myself out.

Upvote for the name spaghetti really!
Why is he so damn straight? I thought snakes, like, slithered...
I am sad that I can't see anymore pics of that cutie (yet, I am split between cuteness and "eeww snakes", more pics would help the cute side in me to win)

For some reason I read this as my sister made a sweater out of spaghetti
Now Spaghetti needs a light layer of cheese.
A sweater won't do anything for a cold blooded animal. The only reason clothes make you warm is because you produce heat and the clothing traps that heat.
His tail is sweaty, scales weak, charms are heavy.There's vomit on his sweater already, his name is spaghetti.
Kevin Durant looks cute in this
Aren't snakes coldblooded?
I'm drunk rn so I'll be that one guy. Snakes don't really 'love' anything. They're next to mindless and only care about food, a place to hide and temperature regulation. They're pretty much neutral to everything else. My rosy boa acts like I'm nothing more than an object it's way.
theres snek in his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti
What a noodle
spaghetti = danger noodle
*On today’s episode of Does Reddit Like Snakes...*Who knows what the answer will be tomorrow
Spaghetti looks more like a cannelloni now
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.
awww i luv sneks <3

There's sweater on his spaghetti already.

Good boy, Spaghetti!
This reminded me of [Lowly Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowly_Worm) from the books of my childhood.  Though for some reason I though Lowly Worm was a snake as a kid I guess.

Can Spaghetti move whilst wearing the adorable sweater? haha
Legit thought you meant for spaghetti noodles. Awesome snake with an even cooler name.
Psssssssghet-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-ti is the sound he would make if he was a Pokémon.
Do snakes actually show affection?
Spaghetti is a great name. Almost as good as my friend's python named Trouser.
Baby it’s cold outsssside
This is exactly what I picture as what happens when someone yells "Ridikkulus" at a snake-shaped boggart
Imagine the phone call between OP and their sister.Sister: *Hey how long is your pet snake?*OP: *uuuhhhh, 28 inches, why?*Sister: *No reason*
Sorry to be 'that guy', but snakes are cold-blooded and thus do not produce their own body heat. Sweaters are made to insulate and keep body heat from escaping through the air. Since snakes do not do this in the first place, the sweater is probably a hopeless cause for reptilian comfort. Actually, the guy would probably be much happier under a warm lamp.But it's the thought that counts, right?
"I knew I could pull off a *turtle*neck."
I’m going to annoy everyone with this knowledge thank you.
"Oh... wow a sweater. Terrific. Just... What a gift. Thank you. This will keep me warm, you know, because of all that *warm blood* in my fucking body."
Rest in Spaghetti, never forgetti.
I need science! For a Warm blooded animal it would help keep body heat in. Does the sweater do anything for the snake, who doesn't generate body heat?
He's mom's spaghetti. <3
Might be cause I am drunk but I picture you're snake screaming in a vegeta tone," women where is my fuzzy snake suit".
His palms are sweaty
I’m terrified of snakes, but even I have to say this is totally adorable lol spaghetti. that is a really cute name for a snake.
That is the most perfect name for a snake.
Danger noodle
Am I the only one who thought of a sweater for eating spaghetti?
I Isssss happy and warmsssss
Looks more like a № 13 linguine to me...
DOES HE HAS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT?
Does your sister have any children? I would like to think some kid out there gets to say “mom’s spaghetti” when talking about the snake.
My mom crochets draft snakes to block the cold coming inside. I'm gonna have to step extra high over that draft snake next time I visit, because I'll remember this picture. I hate snakes, but congratulations on a comfortable-seeming snake who I assume is very nice.
https://imgur.com/a/G4VyW
A bit too inconspicuous. What if someone step on snek?
What a cute little sweater
Can spaghetti move in that sweater?
Oh my God so cute!!!!
On the surface he looks calm and sweaty
I showed my husband the photo after reading the captions to him and his first question is "who is Spaghetti?" And then his second question "who does Spaghetti belong to?" He had no other reaction.  Priorities.
Best. Thing. Ever. Right out of The Far Side.
his name should be spaghetto.
Yo I'm high as fuck am I seeing this shit right now?
r/titlegore
It's so cute!
I am terrified of snakes and will now look forward to the many nightmares I am about to endure! Thank you!
serious question: how do sweaters affect snakes? like, does it keep them warm? or will it cause them to overheat in any way?
Hey what are you knitting there? A sweater for my snake. What does it look like?But seriously would you consider making a video of Spaghetti putting on the sweater?And posting it of course!
Finally... a scaly friend makes it to the front page on this subreddit :~)
Reminds me of a double reed on a bassoon or oboe.
I don't like serpents, but Spags here looks like a good boy.
Ugh! Again with people posting snakes that are kind of adorable. I have a phobia, stop confusing me!
As someone who hates snakes, I can't believe how absolutely adorable this is.
What is that? A turtleneck?
It looks so cute !!!
When your snake rocking a knit like that it ain't a "Spaghetti" it's a "**Swag**hetti"
Fuzzy danger noodle!
Came for the sweater of spaghetti.  Left disappointed.
Spaghetti. Thats fucking awesome
Vacuum your floors once in a while holy moly
Possibly the best name ever for a snake
It's a tube top!
Could she add more rows to make it longer, to cover his tail end? This is adorable 🐍
I’d like to see the video of her putting him in that.
r/sneks gave me a whole new perspective on snakesI use to see them as just creepy, but that sub showed me that they can have the personality of a puppy!
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!
This is why I come to reddit
I love the name
A cute snake with a cute name and a cute sweater? Can I visit your family please? :D
don't thread on me!
I like the sssssssssssssweater.
Danger noodle
That's probably the best name for a snake I've ever heard
Spaghetti needs to be an internet sensation!!!!!
I would do anything for you, Spaghetti
How will you know when he wants to come out and fed up of it?
Omg his name is Spaghetti. I love that❤️❤️
More like a boa constricted amirite?
Time to vacuum
hate to break it to you, but unless that sweater has active heating, then the only benefit that snake will see is not losing any heat to the flooring and looking cute AF.
For a second I thought "who the fuck names their snake Spaghetti?", then I looked at his face. Spaghetti looks comfy.
I like that his name is Spaghetti
This may be the only time a snake has been adorable. But instinct is telling me it’s a trap.
Your name, is The Enforcer.I want my name to be Spaghetti.
Hate to be that guy, but sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals. Sweaters just keep your body heat in, they dont produce heat themselves
[deleted]
What kind of dog *is* that?
The most adorable danger noodle/snek I've ever seen. The sweater/knit tube makes it even cuter.
I think he's fine with winnie the pooh'n it.
Nagini thanks you
Reminds me of a Richard Scarry book.
Are insulating garments helpful for keeping cold-blooded animals warm? Just wondering. Not trying to diminish your sister's thoughtful gift.
no step on snek!
I can’t decide what’s better. The fact that his name is Spaghetti or the fact that he has a sweater?
I really wish people would stop putting sweaters and shit on their ectotherms. I mean its cute for a photo op or whatever but don't let it hand out like that, you're going to kill it.

You named your cat spaghetti?
I'd be surprised if you haven't seen this already, but I thought of you immediately when I saw this u/Androze
Mom's Spaghetti.
Here I am, 10,000 comments down, but I wanted you to know that your sweatered snek was mentioned in another post about the size of Amazon shipping boxes. I hope you read this in time because it is not too far down from this post in r/All. Spaghetti now has Internet fame. It doesn't get any better than that for a snek. Edit. Poster is u/Protanope.
How are sneks as pets? I assume this is a very chill and friendly type? Sneks arent domesticated like dogs and cats, so just wondering
r/sneks will love your comfy noodle
What kind if dog is this?
Nyeh heh heh! I approve!
Basically Liz Climo in real life
Who in the right mind calls their snake spaghetti?
Aren‘t clothes useless for cold-blooded animals?
That's not spaghetti that's a snake
Snake in the sweater already, sisters spaghetti
It is very nice and I know that reptiles love heat,  but I am not sure how effective a sweater is on a cold blooded animal that does not produce a large amount of heat.
That's a personal protection scarf.
So pure.*so pure...*
Venom on his sweater already, moms spaghetti.

Looks more like a Spaghetto to me.
Mmmh … a sweater or a sock?
This makes me want to get a pet snek!
she loves it
Gold is for losers!

For a snake, doesn't a sweater just become a onesie?
Definitely moms spaghetti... “Don’t forget your sweater it’s cold outside.”
well she should have made a vacuum, broom, and DUSTPAN
Does a sweater work for a cold blooded critter?
I'm loving the name spaghetti. For the first time ever it kinda makes a snake cute.
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.
Can he crawl with it on?
2nd place of all time in 1 day... jeebus.
Funny name!
What a great fucking name for a snake.
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!
That looks constricting...
How adorable!I've read some comments calling him  "Danger Noodle".Cool name for a band, eh??"Squirmy Sid and the Danger Noodles"Love him!
My dad and I caught a king snake when we were out in the sticks, he let me hold it and slowly my grip behind it's head loosened enough so it could turn around and bite me.  My dad in turn said "well I guess we'll find out if it's actually a king snake or if it's a corral snake won't we" and laughed. Looking back I'm still not sure if he was kidding.
RemindMe! 4 months
if a danger noodle is in a sweater, that's called a snuggle noodle
Happy constricting!
snakes are cold blooded....
How can you tell? Genuinely curious as I don't own a snake.
I feel attached to spaghett...
"I want my name to be Spaghetti." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEIOGlIy3BA
It is ironic that this will not raise his body temperature at all.
To poop on.
Missed opportunity to nickname him "Long John"
OMG that’s sooo adorable!!!
Not sure how that works considering reptiles are cold blooded, but still pretty neat!
r/deepfakes
1 in infinity this has ever happened and documented God is laughing
is it poisonous and does it bite? How does its bite feel like?

This didn't earn u/Rancor_Emperor a top post trophy? Bollocks I say... BOLLOCKS!Fix this, u/spez.
Wouldn't a sweater be pointless since snakes are cold blooded?
Ssssssssssnuggles
Quick question, how do you get it on him?
[removed]
I have to show this to my husband! We have 4 snakes he he!
Turtleneck?! Interesting choice.
Spaghett!
Fuck snakes!
Just wanna say that insulation on cold blooded animals is very unhealthy for them as it interferes with their body’s ability to absorb heat or cool off.
He's a sleepo beepo
Can someone make me a few of these? I have a 5ft corn snake, 2 3.5ft ball pythons, a 1ft hognose, and a 6ft boa constrictor. I'm in the UK and will happily pay. Also interested in a selection of snake and gecko sized hats.
Never knew snakes can be pets !!! Moment of enlightenment. Are these comparable to Dogs and Cats? Still cannot get my head around. So confused right now. Sorry if I offended you in anyway. From where I come from we have been taught to be scared of them !!!
Putting a sweater on a creature that needs to absorb heat from its environment seems counter productive.
There’s vomit on his sweater already, name’s spaghetti.
You guys realize hes cold blooded so its barely gonna warm him right :P
But snakes don't produce their own body heat, so wouldn't this not work?
Think about the animals in these kind of posts, you’re having a giggle about an animal’s discomfort.

This is so weird but so adorable somehow. He's a charmer srsly.
Moms spaghetti
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day
But Spaghetto can’t move while wearing it without just sliding out, right?
Do you have a hamster named meatball too?
Aren’t snakes cold blooded? Wouldn’t this fail to make him warm?
He loves it until he wants to move around
What happens if he tries to move? Does the sweater move with him or does he just slither out of it? It's gotta be the latter right - too much friction between the sweater and the carpet?
This is pure love
Ssssssssssspeghetti
There's a snake inside the sweater already , named spaghetti
Now Spaghetti has macaroni sweater
I love that name
Everything about this is great! :)
What kind of snek is Spaghetti?
Can he slither around still in it or does he just slither right out of it?

Have you trademarked this?
It's cute just those kinds of blankets don't help keep a cold-blooded animal warm.
How is he gonna crawl now
Spaghetto*
So sweet...
My dogs name is also Spaghetti
How would a sweater keep a cold blooded animal warm?
Would this even make him warmer? Since he’s cold blooded isn’t his body temp the same as the ambient temp? So this wouldn’t make any difference.
Thsts awesome! For some reason I don't mind a snake in a sweater.
Is it your mom's?    ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^so ^^^^sorry.
does clothing really help a cold-blooded animal? Honest question. I am sure they generate some heat, of course, but it enough for the sweater to be effective?
I also could not resist naming one of my spaghettis “Spaghetti”. ;)
Quick question: is he able to move around and keep it on or is he only able to sit still? Cute lil noodle by the way :)
I didn't know that I needed to see a snake in a sweater.... But I'm so glad that I got to see Spaghetti in a sweater.
I don’t know what’s better - your snake’s sweater or his name
Wrap that rascal.
Ok that is hilarious.
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day!! Tell Spaghetti I love him ❤️
Maybe an obvious question ... But how does one get  sweater on said snake?
Worst. Fleshlight. Ever!!!
your nope rope is dope.
ohhhh that’s so cuteeeee
Is that what they call tube snake boogie?
No no no no no...Spaghetti makes me pee a little.

How can you tell?
I have that same carpet.
I bet a reptile feel very happy living as a pet...
Now there’s no excuse if you step on snek
I am now aware that snake sweaters are a thing. This is a truly wonderful Christmas. Thank you OP.

I misread the title as "My sister made a sweater out of spaghetti", *Oh this aughta be good* I thought - AWW ITS A LITTLE SNEK
This makes me regret not getting my ten year old daughter the snake she asked for.
MOM'S spaghetti.
Does she use heat lamps in its enclosue if she thinks the house is too cold for it?
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!
Theres vomit on the sweater already. Moms Spaghetti

There is a book called Crictor about a lady knitting a sweater for a snake, just like this. My mom made my snake one too a few years ago, because of this book!
Read of spaghetti at first.How THAT would look like I wonder...
Adorable!!
Good name!
Do snakes get itchy?
if people start putting knitting on pet cockroaches id probably feel equally weirded out
I know what I'm making for my cornsnek this year.

Not so much snek sweater. More like snek overalls.
I'm no biologist, but since an ectothermic animal (e.g a reptile) relies on absorbing heat from its environment to survive, wouldn't that mean insulation like a sweater would actually be much more of a hindrance to them?
How would you possibly get him in there without pissing him off?
Hahah!!! This is great!!

How did you get that smol boye into it?? Is it snug?
Is he named Spaghetti after this mother, Mom Spaghetti?
Seeing that makes my palms sweaty.
Only one question. Does he belong to your mom?
I think he wants to molt the fuck out of that.
would this make it harder for spaghetti to move? super cute though :)

I always think I want a snake, but then I remember the costs and maintenance to keep our stringiest reptilian overlords pleased, and I don't think I could do it.
Being a cold blooded creature, a sweater doesn’t exactly make sense... not trapping any body heat.
That's so cute.
I'm sorry but this just makes me think of aqua teen hunger force.Cool snek btw
Never heard of Spaghetti, who celebrates that?
Looks like a "Sir-pent"
That's just the waaaave
I was hoping for new spaghetti sauce technology woven into a sweater. Mildly disappointed.
I first read this as "My sister made a sweater from spaghetti..."
This is amazing
There’s a snake in my sweater!
Ssssssspaghettissssss sssssweater sssssseemsssssss sssssweetly sssssssnug
Warm Noodle❤️
What type of snake?
What brand of snek is that, if I may ask?
Looks like a mean ass joint brother, tell me you hit that shit after this pic
He looks warm and adorable!
I respect spaghetti.
Probably a dumb question, but can he move while wearing that? I think it'd be so hilarious seeing a snake with a sweater on just slithering around.
Looks just like my door snake
Noodley Tube dude
snek
Would a sweater actually keep him warm though? Reptiles don't generate body heat to be kept in. I suppose if the sweater itself is warm, the proximity would also keep him warm.
wam snek
Uhh... I don't want to stress you out but there's a snake in your spaghetti :(
very cute
Always use protection on your Spaghetti.
Spaghetti is a great name!
HAHAHAHA! This is hilarious!
i want my name to be spaghettispaghetti NOOOO
Okay. This is gad damn cute. Great name choice, too. Your sister is awesome.
iv seen it all
tube ception!!
I don’t like sneks :(
Very cute :) $0.50 u/tippr
[I want my name to be Spaghetti.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEIOGlIy3BA)
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for Spaghetti.
That ain't spaghetti
That heading was really confusing until I clicked on the thumb nail
Gotta stay warm :)
Spaghetti sweaty
I never thought in my life that I’d ever upvote something with a snek on account of my phobia but darned if this isn’t precious. And the name Spaghetti is fantastic.
Is that your mom's snake?...
Reptiles are cold blooded.
Pretty sure sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals.Just saying... it kinda has the opposite effect right?
That is so cute. Never thought that such things can actually happen.
Snakes make my knees week, and my arms are heavy.
Spaghetti mentioned on Reddit and almost 2000 comments later barely a lyric from Lose Yourself. That must be one adorable snake!
I am always curious how people deal with large snake pets. What do you feed it every day? How do you deal with its poop? Unlike dogs and cats, they do not poop outside or in a specific place, right?
Awesome!
At what point does a snake decide you are not a meal?
NOPE
Other than being cute, would this actually do anything? Technically being cold blooded wouldn't this have a cooling effect rather than warming?
I wanna be called Spaghetti
So this is what spaghetti looks like huh...
Make sure not to get vomit on the sweater and does spaghetti belong to your mom? ;)
Lowly worm IRL.
Ectotherm turns endotherm!
Mom’s spaghetti? Vomit’s in his sweater already.
He finally realised his pipe dream.
I thought this was r/Crochet
But where does he place his legs?
What kind of snake is he?  I've wanted to get a snake for my son, is this a good snake for amateurs like us?
I'm sure it seems obvious but please do not put it on him for extended periods. That could cause some serious thermoregulation issues.
Spaghett**i** is plural though, the proper name for him would be Spaghett**o**
This is a cruel representation of the life of a cold blooded individual just trying to get some snizz
That’s just silly
I just want to know what type of snake this is? Corn snake?
Thisss issss nicessss - snek probably
I believe spaghetti isn’t a singular, so it should be “My sister made a sweater for Spaghetto”
Thats not spaghetti, thats a snake.
Jackets keep us warm by helping us trap in our own heat. I wonder if this sweater helps a cold blooded snake keep warm. Anyone know?
I love it but... You know how a doctor tests the sensitivity of skin with one of two sharp points? Can a snake feel two points if both hit the same scale? Fuzzy may mean nothing to them. And since they don't make their own heat insulation may have little meaning.
so really very cute >,.<
Genuine question here( I don't know anything about snakes) - is this close contact with wool bad for Spagetti's skin?Cool foto OP, really an awww momentWaiting on your sister to knit a sweater for your pet Rancor too, OP!
I thought snakes didn't sweat.
Honestly the best thing about this post is that you named your snake “spaghetti”
Since reptiles are cold-blooded (they don't produce a steady body heat), does a sweater work to keep them warm?
You made my wife squee. Good job!
Wao looks so comfortable
/u/LazarusRise Thoughts?
This is the cutest picture of a snake, I've ever seen.
Cute sweater, still a nope rope.
What species of snake is this?
That's one cozy nope rope
Nope x×××××××××10 fuck that, glad u r warm dude...Fuck th!
So..is spaghetti a fan of purple rain?
He looks stiff as.. well a tube, can he move?
I never thought snakes could be adorable, but this is actually adorable! I love him!
The way it looks makes me wonder what would happen to a smol snek in a chinese finger trap.
She totally deserves it !!
I've never thought of snakes as adorable before. Cool, maybe, but this is a first for me. Awwwwwww :)Also, that name is a hilarious choice. 1000 points to whoever thought that up.
Love the sweater, but upvote goes for calling him/her "Spagetti"
That name is so cute
Sorry you mean noodle
I’m pretty sure snakes are cold-blooded
Snake
Footsie
That is amazing!
Danger noodle.
Haha, he's wearing a sweater but he can't sweat
I wonder how often he slithers through the port of that subwoofer back there and takes naps.
Excellent. Next year you need to sew him a little Santa hat.
Happy snake. =)
Very nice
What kind of snake is it ?
Is it your mom’s pet?
r/sneak is leaking
Ding dong, delivery is here - OP
Schlange
I'm a grown ass man sitting in bed helplessly giggling at the fact that you named your snake spaghetti
My boyfriend and I were just discussing getting a snake and naming it 'Sketti.' I love your little nope noodle and his name. Also he looks super cozy <3
Please Eminem, do a song with these alternative lyrics.
Thats cute
I'm Spaghetti the snake and I start with the letter ***sssssssssss***
S N U G G L E L O N G B O Y E
I’ve always wondered, do pet snakes feel/show love? Or do they just kinda chill there and not care about anything?
Hey uh... You have cat's don't you? 🤔
Is he trained to not bite you?
Is it for real?
How’d you get him in there?
He crawls inside of it and just sits there. after awhile he works his way out. Its more of a cozy sleeping bag if you want to look at it that way. Its the principal!
You think?? With a snake, can one ever be sure.
wow.. just awesome
Now snek is warm blooded :)
Probably already said but snakes are cold blooded, so would this do anything?
Wow😍 cutieeee
What an adorable danger noodle
Must get cold feet
It suits him down to the ground.
I love how the cat is just playing it off, like “alright whiskers, just act normal and pretend like you didn’t just pass through a glass table...”
That is hilarious.  But I am impressed, despite not expecting to fall that far, the cat handled the landing like a champ.
Your cat had a lot of confidence in that invisible table.
"I don't understand... Normally I levitate here. HAVE MY POWERS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME?!?"
I used to have the same desk. Actually frequency in which it needed cleaning is why I got a new one hahaEdit: Apparently most of Reddit also owns/has owned this desk at one time or another.
TIL cats use the scientific method.
That is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen
Lol after the jump the cat was like “wtf is going on lemme check if the table just vanished” then **tapping intensified** and “DAMMIT I KNEW IT”
She's like "WTF DID YOU DO JERRY?! IT WAS JUST HERE!"
The cat version of the classic [dog who thinks the glass door is closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2hmwn7/dog_stays_outside_because_he_thinks_the_terrace/).
"What happened to the magical force  field that used to be here?"
Fuck yes, this gif was worth 187 MB on a 2M connection
At the end he's touching it like "what the fuck is this witchcraft?"
180mb gif? Really?
We did this once to our glass table but instead of jumping on the table, he ran full force into the glass that was leaning up against the wall.  The "Thunk" he made was incredible.
Logitech Z5500?
Still graceful AF
It almost looks like she had a sense of humor about it. This is really cute.Edit: She, not he.
I was incredibly confused by this at first...I have almost an identical desk, with an almost identical sub in the corner, with the same weight under the right side, with similar carpet under, and used to have that same keyboard.  If it wasn't for the wall color (which I really, really like by the way) and the cat (also adorable--I have two, but thankfully they aren't doppelgangers as well) I would have thought that I was looking at my own downstairs.
I have this desk!!! The glass is so scratched and ugly after 3 years. I windex and windex and all I can think of are all the scratches. My cats fear it
I wish I had a cat.I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.:(
I'd love to know what they're thinking...
It really amuses me to think that many animals must think they're levitating when they lay on glass. To them, the world is full of invisible walls that can disappear and reappear at any time.
"ah, yes. Everything is ok.  I meant to do this." *rubs*
Swear to god everyone in the world has this desk
He's probably going crazy and contemplating his entire life thus far
/r/catpranks
Cats are strange and amazing creatures. One of mine is obsessed with the fish tank so much so I count the fish every morning make sure she didn't get one lol. Several times a day she will do a paw check just to make sure the glass is still there, because hey, who knows? Water might be holding itself in place this time.
This should be on r/nonononoyes
I did not expect it to jump up! That was awesome.
I have the same desk.
Me trying to score
I wish I recovered like that
your cat made my day bearable, thank u
/r/youseeingthisshit
What you don't realize is the cat knew that the glass was gone.  The cat was simply testing you to see if you understood its perception of reality.  Cats are always right.  Just realize, now, that when you put the glass top back on, the cat will jump *through* the glass.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?
Hey what’s going on here?
She can be silly sometimes.
I’d score that dive a perfect 10.
I know y'all rich fuckers with 100MB/s, but could we have gifs that do not weigh 187MB pls?
Cat handled that jump like a fucking champion. That's a magical creature right there.
188 MB for a 20 second gif? Fucker!
Yo, I have that same desk. I love that desk. I did very similar thing cleaning it when I went to set down a smoothie , and it went right through.

Lol thank you for sharing this OP. Got a good chuckle from it.
This just made my day, saved forever ♡
I have that keyboard. Logitech g15?
Can someone add cat calculations to this?
I want to see the cat's reaction when the glass top is put back on.
We have the same desk.  And keyboard.. and speakers. What the hell, are you me?
16.83  There's your trouble, homan person, the part that goes here is missing.
cat goes straight to smelling as if that's going to identify the problem lol
I feel like you can see a part of the cat's brain going HANG ON SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT before the jump but not managing to convince the rest of it to stop.
It's kinda frustrating that I'll never be able to convey to that cat what's happening and it'll never know
This cat is the Richard Feynman of cats, using her paw to create a model of the natural world for future reference (the no table where there is clear was a table not now theory of tables) and predictions. Of course scent marking the "phenomenon" with the side of her face and whiskers in case formal model fails at some point in the future.
At least it was a 10/10 jump.
You know how when you're going down the stairs and you think there's one less step than there is and for a split second you think "this is how I die"? Times that by a hundred and I bet that's what that cat just went through.
I once spilled drinking water over my bed I had to take the mattress outside for drying.Came back to find my cat staring at an empty bed frame with devastating look, like it’s the end of the world for her.
"What sourcery is this???"

I needed this laugh.
More important is the update when you put glass back on. Will he or wont he have the same level of confidence?
Dude! I have the same desk and my cat also almost looks like yours!!!
This has made my day. Thank you.
Haha this reminded me of my dog but much less graceful. My dog just kinda flopped over and it took him 4 tries before he realized something was wrong.
/r/BetterEveryLoop
Just watched this on a continuous loop, he jumps so perfectly into the table.
Lol...that is too funny. Poor baby..
Oh my. I just about peed my pants from laughing so hysterically. But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed with guilt for laughing at the poor helpless and confused feline! The wife and I always talk about our West Highland Terrier being a creature of habit. Well, I think the same applies here. Thanks for the video. I pray the cat recovers soon.
“I can’t touch the table! I went right though it! Am I a ghost?!”
Another Z-5500 in the wild! Best audio purchase of my life until I finally upgraded to a large system.
**BOOING!** -- *Oh. what...*
At least it was a graceful leap
''My whole life was a lie.''- Cat
That's a good lookin desk ya got there. Looks just like the one I bought not too long ago lol
No no no, you see... I totally did this on purpose!
I have the same desk works well, lmao your cat, classic.
I'm going to go home and try this on my kitten, thank you for brightening up a long day.
Does anyone know what breed this is? My older cat passed away had this exact fur pattern and everything. Would love to look up pics of the breed.
Marvelous.  Did not stop its curiosity.  Delightful cat.
I have the same desk, but not the same cat.
Will someone that knows how to edit video please show us what it would look like if the cat passed through the magical desk plane and came out on the other end as something else?
"Oh no, I'm a ghost!"
Cat acts all casual... “I’m just doing hurdles”.
Seriously love watching animals figure stuff out.
Nice party/circus trick
Kudos to you for keeping your desk so clean that the cat couldn't tell the glass was gone.
Hahaha
Bless it.😂😂😂
“Removed the glass huh? Fuck it I’ll just fuck up this suction cup!”
I have that same desk! Put a LED strip around the upper black frame and it looks pretty cool.
Heh... I have that desk. I absolutely hate it.
Damn. I guess we vastly overestimate their intelligence. Lovely.
lol..... he acts all casual like he planned it that way............
I have this desk! It sucks!
I have that same desk, and carpet... and wall color with white trimming. My brain glitched for a second
Hey I have the same desk. Time to fuck with my cat!
I like how he played it off..lol
this made me legit LOL
Note to op: When cleaning top of desk, turn desk into ring of fire for cat to jump in
To show solidarity with the cat, place coffee cup on the invisible table🤔🙂
such a fucking idiot
Hey, what happened to the force field that's usually here?
Nailed that jump though
Stuck the Landing thoi !
Ah, is that a z5500 sub I spot there?I have two sets. Probably gonna sell one. Bought it from a guy used for $140 lol. Practically a steal if you ask me. I was running two subs using a cable I got from eBay. You learn to appreciate just how powerful that sub is after running two in unison and being overwhelmed lol.
#Cat logic:*maybe if I paw at, or rub my body on it, it'll go back to normal*
I have the same desk!!Edit: did your desk come with a cat? Mine didn't =(
Wow this looks exactly like my cat of 16 years who passed away last March. Miss ya Flip...
I wish I recovered like that

I hope everyone reading this has a great day. (:
I love how his paws were prepared for landing but nothing was there 😂
I miss my cats :-(
All things considered that landing was graceful as fuck.
179 mb gif??!
Your cat probably thinks it has super powers now and will try to run through a wall.
Can you imagine the thoughts going through that cat's mind, thinking it would land on a table but instead "Oh shit! What! Where's the-"
At least your cat is still curious, some cats won't do anything but sleep.
This is awesome - I love watching children and animals as they try to make sense of their world! Gives one a new perspective on the workings of the brain. 😊

This cat is intelligentlly stupid.
WOOSH
r/animalsbeingderps ?
I have that same exact desk lol, some of the suction cups have lost their suction over the years though
I am guessing your cat is the reason you are cleaning it in the first place? Paw prints EVERYWHERE.
Swish!
I have that exact same desk it’s pretty awesome!
I have the same desk. You have either prevented or caused many hours of cat confusion.
I just like how the cat checks it again with it's paw like "whaaa it was juuust here, I could've sworn..."
i would have been shook too
I had that exact same desk as my first desk, the first delivery had the short and the triangle pieces broken, the second attempt the triangle piece was see through and not black and it took like, 3 weeks for the final delivery with the black corner. Then I got disgustingly drunk one day and broke it :(
I have the exact same desk. Now all I need is the exact same cat.
gfycat in the title confused me for a moment.
Human your invisible forcefield is broken
I have that same exact desk it was like 50$ at walmart 10 years ago. I lost the suction cup thingies though.
I think it's a requirement that everyone once in their life has to own this desk.  I had the silver one.  I think it was ~$100 on Amazon.
I have that same desk.
Hey, that didn't work...  let me try it one more time...
Used to have that same desk. It’s always weird to me that other people have the same furniture as me in their houses.
That is so great.  "Wtf, Kevin?!!!"
I have that exact same desk!
'telle hooman, what magic is this?'
I have the same desk!
My cat did the same thing with our coffee table.  It's a wooden frame with glass panel insets.  We removed the glass for cleaning and Marco jumped onto it like he normally does and ended up doing a front flip through it, poor guy.
Now I want to take the glass out of my coffee table.
Boing! “Wait. How’d I get back down here?”
r/catpranks material
Basically cats just trust that the glass is there, probably some black magic to them.

haha what a fuckin idiot
 Cats are known for their champion landings.
Mmmmmmm... still got your Logitech Z-5500. Love that sound system.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?
Haha I used to have the identical desk! Sold it when I had to move to another place. I needed to clean those glasses almost once every four or five days, otherwise it becomes unbearably dirty.You have a cute cat!
"Maybe if I hit it with my paw it will come back"
Science plays a part here. I'm not sure how, but I am certain it does.
Youre a wizard harry
That was a great jump.
You monster
That's is SO funny
Is this the matrix they are always talking about
Your cat looks exactly like my cat, Twix.
I'd like to see the reaction after you put the glass back on
Cat.exe has stopped
He is confused kkkk
Are... Are you me? I have a desk, speakers, keyboard, and a tabby that all look very identical to yours.
oh nooo :(
Hey I had that desk!
Dude we have the same desk! The beat deska come from the Amazon!
I’d like to see him try that when you put it back on...
The form on that feline. Absolute unit
Hey I have that exact desk!
How many jumps onto the "desk" did it take for your cat to figure this out?
I'm in a library, i cant laughing out loud like this....
Meanwhile, a human expects one last 4 inch step that isn't there and dislocates hip.
I have the same desk! I ripped off the shelf thing and left one arm on for my headphones to hang off of lol
Was is it glass?

I have almost the same desk, and the same Logitech Z5500 subwoofer beneath it.  I hope I can get my cat to perform this stunt as well, that was fantastic.
I love this haha
Cat taps the desk and says what is this sorcery??
My long lost Desk sibiling!
Had the same desk in my old apt
That cats going to piss on something tonight I guarantee it
I have that same desk lol
I have an almost identical desk. Bought from IKEA 28 years ago.
Yep.. Right here... This is basically why I Reddit - I could watch this on a continuous loop for hours.  Cats are the best
I must have watched this over a dozen times, every time just as impressed.
Must have jumped to far and missed the table, let me confirm if the glass top is still there.
“Careful, human. All is not as it seems.”
I used to have this same desk. I got it from Jysk. I actually kind of hated it so I sold it.
 I have that same desk! Shelves built in on the right side? Great for gaming

r/StoppedWorking
something's awry in the Kingdom
Instead of a desk, my dad had a fish tank that his cat liked to jump on. One day, he took off the cover to clean it. His cat jumped in the tank.
I think all of you are missing what this cat is doing... He's clearly an opportunist, using the bar to perfect his his high jump.
I see we have the same desk! Does it also drive you fucking Bananas when you try and get close and hit your chair wheels on the center legs?
I have that same desk, I think it was a target original
Cat just confirming suspicions.
Yo I have the same desk, 10/10 would recommend
It’s crazy how a cat can judge the height of something, and then launch itself to a perfect landing. Not too high, not too short. But just right to ensure a soft landing.
This post is going places.
https://goo.gl/images/tRPuhT
10/10, graceful landing
Whats going to be funnier is when he accepts the glass is not there and slams right into it when you put it back
I ~~could~~ would watch this forever

"yeah I totally meant to do that."
Does this qualify for r/animalsbeingderps? Absolutely hilarious!
I have this exact desk, now I feel like I need to clean it.
Yeah, I've never cleaned the glass.
LMAOWhen he jumped through the desk I completely lost it
i have that same desk.
You have pretty feet for a *dude*
I hate that desk, I have the same one, just without the glass now. Was stripping a wire and the wire strippers slipped, hitting the edge of the glass, shattering it in a billion pieces. Glass. Everywhere. Took an entire day to clean it all and I still find pieces of glass under things to this day.
Ha ha ha ha my husband has the same desk. I’ll have to try it with my kitty Chef.

It's truly amazing how both intelligent, and how stupid this behavior is.

You must have had a really clean desk for your cat to fall for this. (I don’t dust as often as I should)
I had this exact desk though mine grey...solid corner desks
r/hangers
No the kitty understands. He is just taking this opportunity to practice high jump
I find amazing that kitteh is using his whiskers pointed outward to make sure he doesn't boop the glass with his nose.
Had the same desk. Black glass looks soooooo nice. But a dust gatherer.
Damn this looks like my exact setup when I was a kid, had the same desk and same sub (in the same spot) and keyboard and everything.Same kind of cat too! WTF

r/StoppedWorking maybe?
So years ago I had a chinchilla called Perry. He was fucking adorable, he was like my best fuzzy little friend. He liked to sit either with or on us.He got so used to jumping on the foot stool we had that one night when my mum moved it he kept jumping up and trying to land on it even when it clearly wasn’t there, and he was so confused and determined that if he just jumped one more time he’d land on it as always. It’s one of the funniest and most adorable things I’ve ever seen an animal do, and this reminds me of that. Animals rock
OMG, at 0:17, that's the first time I've ever seen a cat actively use its whiskers to feel for something it can't see before confirming with a paw.
“where’s the invisible platform”
Alley-oop!.. Wait wait whoa whoa whoa...oh okay
“Heh, I totally knew there wasn’t anything there. I just did it for fun just cus. Hey this is a nice subwoofer what is it?

Reminds me of the first time my cat jumped up on the toilet seat only to find out that the lid wasn't down.
[https://youtu.be/yYfiAkGT4N4](https://youtu.be/yYfiAkGT4N4)
I used to have the exact same desk.
187MB gif? Ooooof
Can you imagine being able to casually jump up to 3 times your height
Random question but what's supporting that quarter circle piece? Looked connected on one side and not the other with no leg support. Yup I'm bored.
Same desk :D
Somethins fucky boys
I love it, that could've gone so poorly but it didn't
I had that desk. You don’t remove the glass for cleaning. Removing entire fingernails is less painful than the assembly of that desk.
Is it because he’s dum or he can’t see glass ?
LMAO awesome!
Classic corner glass desk, got one myself.  My cat just decides to knock all my shit off it lol.
This is the first post to make me genuinely laugh for a long time !
Is that a g105 keyboard?
You obviously did not consult the proper authority before starting your cleaning job.
Stoopid cat
 Ay nice, I have a black glass and a solid version of that desk set up; super affordable and useful!
I’m assuming it is a glass top?
That looked like a terrifying moment
I once took a large poster off my wall due to construction outside shaking the walls so bad I thought it was going to vibrate the frame off the wall...my cat freaked out when she realized it wasn't there any longer, cats are weird.
Have the same desk and I hate it. Can’t stretch your legs out properly because of the bar under there
2 pointer or 3?
I used to have that desk and loved it! Keeping it clean was the worst, and made me mange my cables way more because if how visible everything was.
Grats on the thousands of karma that Auri just generated! :)

She did a trick!! Perfect form!
Amazing how it can fuck up so badly and still make it look good. Every other animal would face-plant in this situation...but it just lands graciously and shrugs it off.
I have the desk, Amazon?
/u/anti-gif-bot
I must have watched this at least fifteen times now. Lovely cat!
Hey, I have the same desk. My cat loves laying on the glass in the Summer.
I LOLed.
Ugh cats are so cute
pointer-events: none;
How many times did he do it?  Also, is that the Linda desk?
If only I had that much grace when going for an extra step that isn't there.
I love this cat 😻

".......Je ne comprend pas!"
You broke your cat. Lol.
I actually have that same desk (got it used 2 years ago), and never realized that circular part was meant to turn it into a corner desk. It all makes sense now!!!
I have the same desk how neat
Stupid dog
I have the exact same desk! I have to try with my cat now...
I have the same desk, nice.
Awww poor meowYou’re a magician according to her
200MB for 20 seconds? Is this a joke, OP?
I don't understand why most animals have trouble seeing glass. Is there some kind of abstraction required that most animals are not capable off? Glass isn't really invisible. So something has to be fucking with animal brains to have them act silly.
Dude I have that same desk!!
I have that desk lol
I guess birds aren't the only ones who don't understand glass. lol
I have that desk. And a cat. Hmm.
My parents used to have a glass topped coffee table that I loved to climb on. Well, as I was getting bigger, my mom was worried I would break the glass and get all cut up. So they took the glass off. I then proceeded to climb up, business as usual, and fall straight off the edge like a lemming. My dad can't tell the story without dying laughing. That cat is my spirit animal.
I have that same desk. I have had it for 7+ years and it is still going strong.
I have same desk, different cat
Foot
I had the same desk got it off of amazon
reminds me of my cat.
How many times did he try to jump on the table?
“Hooman, what have you here?”
Hhhhhhhaaaaaa
I love when his feets line up perfectly with where the table is supposed to be
Either that or he understood it perfectly
No bueno, Don. No bueno. What's next? Shrooms and David Lynch films? You, blackmagicfuckery bafoon.
My dogs do something simlar with our beds.We use the metal foundations instead of box springs. So when we have mattresses off to clean & just the slip pad on metal frame. The dogs jump on it thinking its solid, then learn its not lmao
This made me smile.Thanks for sharing I needed this (just one of those Monday's GRRR)
this is amazing, it made me giggle out loud, and is utterly adorable. Thanks, OP.
Awwww
r/CatTaps r/AnimalsBeingDerps
But the thing. Its my thing, why wrong?!
I have the same desk!
lol that cat's never gonna trust that table again even after you put the glass back on. It will probably screw his mind if you put him on it like "what kind of sorcery is this hooman?!"
Lol when he tries to find glass with his paw
That feline must have thought it would make quite the landing.
Pause it when the cat reaches the invisible glass and you realise how accurate their jumps are, all four paws are on the "glass" flat.
You know what I don’t understand? Why we still have these giant, long, slow, GIF’s. It’s like sending a fax in 2018.
I think my cat and your cat are twins
 I have that exact same desk. Way to go NFM!
Hey we have the same desk!
For a second I thought this was my old room,  same carpet, wall color, desk and even same keyboard lol
I have the same desk.
I have that same desk
:(
This is the equivalent to dogs wont enter glass door with the glass removed
Cutest
Never have I noticed how accurately a cat plans its jumps until now
WE HAVE THE SAME DESK OP, WE'RE PRACTICALLY BROTHERS
Ayee I have that exact same desk
How many tries did she make before you started filming?
I have exactly the same desk. I also have a cat. I'm going to try this.
What type of cat are they?
I used to have this exact desk with a Z5500 in the same spot. Neat.
i have that desk. love it :)
My desk is totally different.
r/catpranks
Lmao, stupid cat
I always wondered what that face rubbing means, sometimes my cat randomly does it when I call her name.
Cat.exe has stopped working
I've Just watched this about 20times
I have this exact desk! Does the top of yours fall off too if you bump it the wrong way?
cat be like = my Reality is broken Kill Me
I’m pretty sure I just ordered that exact desk. You like it?
Mym
This is amazing😄 I hope someone can overlay the calculations going on in the cute kitties head like with the math equations and such. I'd do it but I don't even know where to start lol
How can an animal be so stupid and yet so smart at the same time.
Hey, I have that desk! Hey! I have cats... I wonder how they'll react
Same desk buddies!!
Upvoting because I have that exact same Edison Walker desk and G15 Logitech Keyboard.
“Hey! Where’s the thing I used to stand on?”
SAIL!
I have the same desk
I had the exact same desk :o
We have the same desk! I wish my wall was as pretty as yours though!
Did you get that desk from Target? I have one exactly like that and I love it
*You're messing with my mind, human. Keep this up and I'll mess with your shoes.*
"What's going on here Kevin? Did you disable the table force field?"
I have the same desk but in black glass.cats do the same thing.
My brother has this exact same desk.
LOOK AT HIS FRISKY WHISKERS
I love how the cat checks the table with its paw in the end, like: "..the fuck? ....seems solid..."
Our cats are twins. It's like watching a video of my cat
10/10 outstanding high jump
Just magic!
Poor kitty keeps going to the human and looks up like, "Would someone PLEASE explain this to me? I'm getting not a little freaked out!" Or, "OK, whose been screwing with my stuff?" For those who aren't cat fans, (I can't believe there would be such a person) cats think EVERYTHING is is theirs. All they have to do is rub the sides of their faces on an object- or human- and BOOM it's theirs!
How I slide into them DM’s
This  cat have chance in next olympiques ;)
OMG THIS LOOKS LITERALLY JUST LIKE MY CAT 🙀 she even has the same thing going on with her hind legs where one is white and the other has a streak of color to it.
r/sneakybackgroundfeet
I have a feeling this was not the cat's first jump.
He stuck the landing really well.
I used to have the same desk. IKEA? I can't remember.
She's so dumb😂😂😂
This is one of the best video’s i’ve ever seen!
Oops!
.
That's my exact desk!'
Metaphor for those of us who jump to conclusions.
Have same desk.  Cat confirm.
Please compress the file more
Do you reckon that felt like when you take an extra step at the top of a set of stairs?
My grandpa used to say ‘smart like a combine’
He'd be good friends with that dog that didn't understand a glass top table (when the owner dropped a snack on it and the dog went looking for it on the floor and was generally bamboozled)?
My Internet isn't very good :(I'll never be watching a 185 MB gif. I'll use my imagination though.
r/sneakybackgroundfeet
Bamboozled!
If only we could teach cats to skateboard. Look at that perfect foot placement, as if he was setting up to land a kickflip...
LOL😂😂😂
Is that a maribo desk?
I have that same desk!
I had to do a double take because this cat is the identical twin of my cat. I even looked over to see if he was in his bed.
This gif is single handedly clogging the internet.
/r/catpranks
Cats are surprisingly smart, they don't quite understand whats going on but they acknowledge when things happen and something is different. I fill up bottles with water and my cat knows water comes out the tap so he goes looking for it and down the sink but doesn't quite understand what it is im doing.
I had that same desk from staples!
lmao 100k upvotes in 4hrs
I have that same exact desk
That’s just too funny.
That’s amazing
So much for object permanence
They got her a gift, too! Aww!
Awww! I just want to hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Too cute.
She is too adorable!!!
She seems nice
The best birthday surprises are the ones you don't expect. Once I remember punching in at work and the machine playing happy birthday. It was just a machine but it somehow meant a lot to me in that moment.
I miss my Grandma.
Be kind to people. Love them. They are hurting and they need it.
After all those “Oh gawd, mum no” birthday cake surprises, I’m glad to see one that’s more me.My childhood was awful, I never actually got to celebrate my birthday, closest was one time where they wanted to take pics for family members, so they decked the table with food and made me sit prettily. No birthday party, even today at 28.If someone would surprise me with a birthday party or even a cake, I honestly think I would cry.EDIT:Wrote this right before going to bed, and waking up to this was, well, I cried in the bathroom. From kind messages to offers for proper mothering, it’s all amazing, and somewhat overwhelming. I’m not exactly used to anyone paying me any mind, and now I’m crying again.I will reply to everyone who messaged me, but for the moment I’ll say this:Because I live in The Netherlands, and nowhere near many of you, I won’t be able to take you up on your offer for a party or being my DJ. In this case however, the thought most definitely counts. Thank you very much.
Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN
This made me so emotional.
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.
She still has the childlike wonder.
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.
That’s all it takes. Minimal effort. It takes minimal effort to be kind and nice to people. Remember that next time you’re out and about.
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!
Selfish question: the woman in this video reminds me so much of my ex-girlfriends mother. We’ve been broken up for nearly 2 years— but I’ve never forgotten the love and support her mother gave me. Absolutely wonderful woman— but no desire to get back together with her daughter. Would it be a weird move to send my ex-girlfriend’s mother a letter, just thanking her for everything she did for me? I feel guilty I never properly expressed my gratitude at the time— but don’t want her to be weirded out by some random card from her daughters old boyfriend.
This lady looks like she would bake the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.
And you just know they wouldn’t have bothered if she wasn’t someone that they really liked. Someone that really deserved a sweet surprise.
Waitresses never kiss me on the cheek.
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.
Props to the waitress, what a genuinely warm hug and peck on the cheek, bless her heart too. Back when my dad was still living, and in an assisted living facility, I would see him and his elderly floor mates very often.Nothing made them light up more than a young person spending time with them, the younger the better.And if you brought a baby, we’ll forget about it, plan on spending the whole day because you will see the sheer joy that a baby will bring to this generation that raised a lot of us.If you’re a teenager reading OP’s post with a smile. Say hello to someone this darling woman’s age, help them with their groceries, or pay for their coffee. More often than not, you won’t be disappointed. Your heart will swell like the Grinch’s when he clapped eyes on little CindyLoo Who.Here’s hoping this woman has many more birthdays and each are filled with this much joy, if not more.
Can all things on the internet be things like this please
Looks like they dropped a heavy gift bag on her too.
When we get older, we don't put as much value on our birthdays. It's easy to just let them pass by with minimal fuss when we're adults. But something like this, this little reminder that it is an important day, especially to just a casual acquaintance, is incredibly nice and meaningful.
Oh my god she seems like an absolute sweetheart, she's the sorta customer I miss from working customer service.
This is so precious, and her husband is wearing a checkered shirt too!She seems a really, really lovely person. :)
That makes me cry. That's more than I got on my birthday. It's nice to be noticed and feel wanted.
I want to just give her a squeeze! Her face is just pure joy and appreciation.
This looks irish
The amount of feels I’m having right now...
I am a cold, bitter, broken old man and even I liked this one.
I LOVE THIS!!!!
These are the types of people that make working at a restaurant totally worth it! Happy birthday to this sweet soul who is obviously so deeply cared for!
She’s perfect for the old guy from UP
Just got off the phone with my mom wishing her a happy birthday. After seeing this I would have given a lot to do this same thing for my mom
Can we talk about how they match?
What a beautiful moment!
This brings tears to my eyes. My grandmother and I had a diner we would get breakfast at almost everyday. Once she became weaker we went less and less. Everyone at the restaurant knew us by name and had our order in before we even sat down, we truly felt like family. She would write personal cards and get gifts for every staff member on their birthdays and holidays. Everyone loved her and would come out of the kitchen to give hugs and kisses. She passed away a year ago. This brings me so many good memories about her thank you.
You’re going to make me cry.
Wow really nice!  Small gesture but it goes so far!
Man I wish there was a subreddit for happy old people
I work in a hospital ER and the other day and one of our patients came in on his 97th birthday. He had no nobody with him.The catering service sent up a little chocolate cake and all the nurses came into his room and sung him happy birthday. He was so happy he was crying.
/r/eyebleach
AwwwHappy birthday!
u/commonvanilla Do you know this woman? She looks very much like my mother and has very similar mannerisms.
Oh my god she’s so cute! 10/10, would hug
I need a hug like that rn.
The way she looked at them after she gave her a hug and put her face in her hands was so endearing. Props to that staff!
I fucking love how appreciative people are. This is some good shit, fuck yea it’s good to see this
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady’s day.
Awwwww the rest of the world, listen up. Be this. Please. I hate not having this everywhere. We would all live in heaven just for a little bit if we could do this
Brb melting
I bet she makes amazing cookies
Sure, the granny is adorable. But she looks like a Grade-A certified Badass with her collar popped like that. Like she could go full John Wick on you if your not careful
OP here after a sound night’s sleep (no school, no sleep deprivation tonight). I can’t believe what a beautiful response this has gotten. This video I brightened my entire weekend after a stressful week and I’m overjoyed to see so many people liking it too. Reading through all the nice comments directed to this video and to the other commenters...it’s such a change from normal reddit.For some who have asked, no it isn’t me. This is a video I found off Instagram that was too beautiful not to share.
What gentle soul! A ball of positive energy, an most of all, a destroyer of cakes and baked goods
Can I hug her?
so precious
People like this made waiting tables almost worth it.
Tickled pink!
Meanwhile in other threads little spoiled shits are like "ugh! I can't believe someone would do that to me!"
i miss my nana
I need a hug from this sweet lady.
 I react this way every time I’m given cake, even if I’m buying it for myself
She looks like such a genuine person.
she deserves so much more than free cake ♡
Delightful!!
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen
So cute! So much happy! I love it. She’s so appreciative.
I haven't recieved a birthday gift since I was like 14 years old. I'd probably react that way to free birthday cake too!
 Haven’t had cake in my bday in over 10 years. I’m a 35 year old man, I think I would even get a little teary eyed.
This seriously brought a tear to my eye. So sweet.
I don't know this lady but I love her so much.
awwe. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years as a server/busser. This elderly couple always came in at 1pm. God I loved them. One day the wife didn’t come. She had passed away. :( my boss let me take the day off. Sometimes when you’re working at restaurants you really look forward to seeing your regulars.
That made her year. This is awesome. This comment will get buried but I don’t care. This video is amazing.
Give her everything!
So precious!
I’d love to run a little cafe just so I can make these kinds of friendships
I literally feel unworthy of watching her pureness she is downright an angel
I love her already..
her reaction is priceless <3
I audibly whispered aww.. my friend heard, was interested, and ultimately awwgreed
Omg she’s the cutest. I want to be friends with her. PS. I’m a 26 year old guy.
I wish I grow old like her many decades after and people around are still as kind
Old people are cuter than babies, don't @ me
I want to give that woman a hug
Awww Happy Birthday!! We all love you and you’re adorable!!
Sweet, reminds me of my angel mother. My mother deserves her life story to be published in the Library of Congress archives. And all of love I can give her.  Love you mom!
SHE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED
What a joy to be loved.
That is a woman that does not get appreciated enough in her daily life.
This makes me want to hug my mom.
This place looks like a nice place to eat
You can just tell she is a humble person!
What a lovely gesture and reaction!!
I’ve noticed how older women are so much more appreciative of the little things...
And now I'm crying.
Fuck all the niceties, I hope they have some freaky birthday sex.
This is so sweet
Waitress was going in for the lips for a second there
Well shit i cried within the 8 seconds
This is what life's all about.
Man I gotta call my grandma
Sweet!
What a nice lady
So sweet
This is great to see! Maybe one of the first times I’ve see someone truly appreciate this gesture.
Sooooo cuuute!
That is so nice! Great job!
Cherish every moment.
:)
Lovin' the best of humanity!
This made her day I bet!!!! RAK!!!
I would give her all the presents and cake!
Oh why is there never a mirror bot when I need it?
She reminds me of a scene in The Office where Tobey’s little girl asks Phyllis if she’s mother goose!! That scene was adorable!
This is exactly what I needed while studying for 4 exams :D
I need to remind myself at 52 that it’s ok to have joy like this on my birthday. I need to give MYSELF joy too! My son is 14 today and the joy on his face from the gift of black and white skull sheets, a longboard and some goofy tchotchkes is unmeasurable.
Coming from someone who works in retail:EVERYONE should be that excited to be given free stuff. The world needs more people like her. <3
Small towns really are the best about this. My grandparents have been going to the same Italian restaurant every Friday night for 20+ years and the owner still has their special table & recognizes me from when I was a toddler
I don’t know why this sweet lady is making me tear up but here I am. I hope she had a good birthday. <3
Omg she reminds me of my mom!!! My moms health isn’t well, so this is a reminder I need to give her lots of love.Eep, I may cry now.
Ohmygoodness! I bet that hug was so soft and smellnice!
I send you a Happiest Birthday from me a total stranger.   I have stolen several relatives from other people,  you are the latest.  I have  no relatives left , stealing them is my way of getting new ones & only the best.  You are a lovely lady.  Eat your cake & others for years to come.  You are now my "Auntie!"   See you next year.
They got her a gift too?!! Jesus Christ how sweet are those waitresses?
True graciousness. What a sweetheart!!
Looks like the lady who constantly complains but the restaurant has a good heart so they gave her a gift
I miss my mom.
That is the sweetest thing iv ever seen. So genuine
These regulars.  This is why I absolutely love my job.
That looks like a very sweet little lady. Reminds me how much I miss my grandma.
Just beautiful 💕💕💕
She is the cutest!
She reminds me of the sweet old lady with syphilis on House!
I wanna hug that grandma ;-;
I would give any of my big spending regulars to be able to wait on these two... I’m sure they are a god damned pleasure!
I don't even know her and I love her. Damn you reddit!
This is so precious! My heart can't take it!
The genuine joy on her face, oh my goodness 😍
can she tell me it’s all goin to be okay
Gosh, this gave me a cheery.  I miss my mum \*Wibble
It costs you so little to be kind. Be kind to someone today!
She might be the cutest thing I have ever seen. What are puppies?
Had something similar happen to my husband on his birthday earlier this year. Diner we're semi-regulars at (him even more than me) gave him a cake with ice cream as a surprise when they found out it was his birthday. It wasn't even my birthday, but just seeing someone be so kind to someone they only know through brief encounters at their job absolutely warmed my heart. It's nice to realize there are people out there you don't even realize that care.
So jealous...would love to have an opportunity to make someone feel that way 🤗
26 year old dude, I can’t! 😭
Damn this is the sweetest thing I have ever seen.
As you get older, birthdays are a reminder that time is passing. Not all birthdays are happy days. The look on this lady's face is wonderful. She is truly overcome by the kindness expressed by the staff working in the place she is eating. I feel her emotion and understand it. It is a mix of happiness, surprise, gladness and perhaps some pain. I wish her much happiness.
I wish I had the ability to feel happy like that about something.
I wonder how many people suddenly got an urge to call/see there grandma. I already know mine would ask if I'd eaten anything yet the second I show up.
this is too wholesome.
Oh my. My heart.
I know that for many people, they absolutely dread social interaction... but for some of us, the interaction with bartenders/servers is the only social interaction we get.
They made her feel so special! That’s some human goodness.
That'll be $10
As a server every restaurant has these precious few who we all care about and are willing to chip in money for birthday gifts. They give reactions like this and then leave a handwritten thank you card. Those regulars make our day despite tip. They are civil to us and treat us like family. Bless that woman and the impact she has had on her servers. She deserves the best.
I want to give her a hug and talk to her all Sunday afternoon
I want to travel to wherever she is and give her the biggest hug. She looks so touched, bless her.
Old people are awesome.
You can tell she's genuinely happy. Things like this is why I haven't given up on humanity.
Awww, people being lovely to one another
You just know she's going to smell like biscuits when you hug her.
Omg I love her
I’m sad and miss my Grandma now. I hope this lady is doing good. Not that she’s definitely a Grandma. But reminded me of her.
r/mademesmile
Like my mom, literally, exactly same reaction. <3
Oh man. This hit me in the soft place. I work in ths hospitality industry, and I've tried to make it a point to stress relationships like this. The problem is the further up you go, the farther you get from it. I miss times like this.
This is the highest upvoted post I have ever seen. And I like that.
I love my mom. I don't tell her it enough... I need to go tell my mom I love her before its too late.Wow I'm getting teary eyed.
She deserves so many kisses!
The highest upvotes I've seen ever on a post and it's so adorable
OMG she looks like Muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog! So cute!
there's a really terrible storm where Im at right now which scares the hell out of me and honestly this cheered me right up. Thanks a ton
She looks 80 but acts like an 8 year old girl (in the most positive way possible).
Look at the bitch all jelly in the background... just munching away looking like someone else's happiness is spoiling her appetite. I just got off an eleven hour shift and that lady might be a saint but at this point anything but a smile looks like they want the manager.
The lady in the very back has the poker face of Wendy Byrde
They are matching! It gets cuter!!!
The best feels makes my heart warm :)
She's so cute.. I wish her good health and a long, happy life.
She‘s the CUTEST! Like a little child who is so happy and carefree. Cuuute.
Makes me want to call my mom
I love how the fellow diners didn’t frantically pull out their cell phones.
I love this so much.
Now this is quality customer service - showing appreciation towards the good ones.
I visited my local coffee shop alone and told them it was my birthday.The lady behind the counter said 'next please'.I'll never forget it xx
It’s those damn circular glasses, they’re just too cute.
Made me smile. Ear to ear.
It was after this that ex leader & commander of Berlins notorious Hitler youth Gertrud hemmel was descovered. She was responsible for the persecution of Jews, LGBT and people of African descent. all thanks to this video
I think the lady in the back lit the candle with her gaze.
Love to see these things.
The lady in the background? No one..?
Good people.
The older you get, the less amount of acknowledgment you get on your birthday. That needs to change.
This feels like it’s in Britain... anyone else feel this? :)
What a nice lady
I thought puppies were the cutest thing in the world. I was mistaken.
That's awesome
I’ve watched one hundred times.
I want to hug her so bad :,)
best thing ive seen all day :)
I had the exact same reaction just watching it. How sweet 😊
I just got goosebumps, so much amazing!
Please reverse it.
As a server, this made me tear up.
She's so damn wholesome I wanna give her a hugg
She is a little cinnamon roll♡
This video gave me goosebumps for some reason. This lady is beyond adorable
Oh my god that was adorable.
this warms my heart
Haha, that’s cute
I love this stuff. If youre organizing a party pls invite me.
She's so hecking cute!!!
This. Is. So. Cute.
That was heartwarming :,)
Why are my eyes getting sweaty?
Made me cry
Who's cutting the onions.
Classic grandma
I needed to see this tonight
Kinda reminds me of my Mom. Rip mom
All the feels
Love the customers reaction, but awesome reaction by the waitress too. Look at the smile on her face being able to give this woman her cake. Pure happiness.
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady’s day.
Awh! I think my heart smiled, this is so pure! Its adorable how excited she was
I cried. She’s too cute, I can’t
AWWWWW
Omg this warms my heart
I love stuff like this
Just seeing her reaction teared my eyes up dang
That smile!
This is me whenever someone says anything nice about me
That is officially the cutest couple Ive ever seen. They’re wearing the same shirts! #relationshipgoals
Aw, shucks. Well that's just the sweetest darn thing ever.
I want to bake her all the cakes.
Sometimes humans do nice things and remind me not to hate them all. 😊
Why is Reddit making me cry again
She looks like a little kid. Too damn cute.
Shes so cute omg
Beautiful gesture!
True r/aww
For the business, as a customer nice to know you care.For the customer, it's nice to know a business notices you.
This is the type of lady I want to become. Surely she's a very loving person to have made so many friends in life, and she's so appreciative
She looks like a 10/10 grandma. Also for a split second you see her husband who looks like the cutest sweetest old man!
Is this in Ireland?
Damn, she reminds me of my grandma. I miss her.
You restore my faith in humanity! Thank you!
She's so sweeeeet! I wanna hug her!
You never know if this was one of the only birthdays someone acknowledged for her.
No old couple is complete without matching shirts.
Omg my heart!!
Granny's pilled out
Such a heartwarming gesture!
Wow I didn’t expect to start crying
That's goddam adorable
Why can't more of us find the joy in life like this?!
Bless her

Happy birthday to her!

Uhm, so, why am I tearing up like this on a Friday night?
Just cried a little
I hope I can make someone this happy one day
This is so cute
the title is so itchy. free cake? and this why she is happy? she's happy because they care about her birthday.
That's really sweet.
That lady has to have a dog named Courage.
Uhh. Pretty sure that lady behind her wants her dead. Wtf.
Making people happy feels better than just about anything... Truth
Right in the feels
For whatever reason I sadly think her kids are assholes. They could be dead, but it just really seems like she "expects" this, just not from these people. Really great video honestly, and makes me want to call my Bestemor.
This is so hecking cute
Sometimes, the smallest gestures are gigantic to those without family or friends. Thanks for sharing this.
She is genuine, she is great!Also, this is me everyday of the week working free fake birthday deserts at chain restaurants.
Aww, my heart.
This is the cutest!
I want to cry
Hey is that my aunt’s friend. She is 69 this year
This is wonderful!
This made my heart warm!
Every single thing about this screams England
Can life be more of this please? Kthxbye. 🙃
This is so sweet!One of the only things I miss about being a server were my regulars. A good regular could really improve my mood during a bad shift.
You can see the little girl she used to be with that expression and arm movement. So adorable!
I’m ugly crying over this
The little things really do matter
That is so sweet!
I love this! She’s so cute!!!!
I don't know how, and I've never said this before in my life, but "heartwarming" is a gross understatement.
Dawwwww I love her!!
This ain’t it chief *sniffles* this ain’t it
What an incredibly beautiful moment
The world is filled with good people
The older woman is adorable, but what is up with the woman in the back staring at the wait staff like she's deciding which one to eat first?
She’s so cute (:
Beautiful.
So sweet!!
My greatest regret as an adult is not taking the time to get to know my grandfather when he was so adamant on informing me of the Mayan civilization. Please love and appreciate those around you, having a loving family is so special.
This is so sweet that I need a couple extra hearts to even fathom the cuteness without exploding.
the act was more critical than the 'free'
Damn. I lost my grandma about 4 years ago. I’m strange about mourning death. I don’t necessarily get sad and if I do it doesn’t last long. Granted my grandma and I were not super close but seeing this almost brought tears to my eyes. She looked strikingly similar to this woman and acted in that same mannerism.
My heart is melting. This is so sweet!
Kneaders?
Can i have her as my grandma?
Scamming people into getting yourself a cake by faking birthday . Trick is sure as old as this grandma.
But does she remember is the 21st of September.
I hated getting sung to at a restaurant, I hated the spotlight. But later on I loved pranking my dates with a fake birthday surprise at restaurants. I guess it was pretty juvenile in retrospect.
Proper, surprise.
Could be wrong, but is this Bob Evans?
The sweetest!
Awwwwww there is still some goodness left in this world!!!! I love it. Every part of it. She is so beautiful! Gargh .... XD
I always loved surprising customers with free pancakes and icing for their birthday. Recently I had a little boy who had his birthday and when I came out with his birthday pancakes, both him and his dad were so happy! It made my night just seeing their smiling faces!
My heart 😢😢😢
Shout out to the server too, the joy on her face at being able to do something like this makes me smile too :)
r/mademesmile
Welp, time to call grandma and tell her I love her.
Awwwww she is sooooo cute omg
this is so insanely adorable
I love that I went into the controversial section of the comments and I found no negative comments about this sweet little lady. I would upvote twice if I could.
r/humansbeingbros
Damn. I want a hug
Grandma poppin that collar!
She looks like what Queen Elizabeth would have looked like if she grew up middle class in South Carolina
That's so sweet!
I love old people. Yes, even the mean ones.I'm 32 and I had a client at my work named Henry. He was in his late 80s. He was always incredibly firm, abrupt and short when you would talk to him. One time, after knowing him for like 12 years and seeing him multiple times a year (I was his accountant) and never getting more than a few words from him and a glare, I mentioned that I was brewing beer at home. He immediately changed, everything from his posture to the sound of his voice, even his eyes. We talked about beer for maybe 30 minutes. It was fun and it was like talking to a completely different man. He told me about all his favorite beers, what meals he would have with each one, everything. He passed a few months after that conversation. I feel like there was so much more that I could've learned about him had I only had the time or maybe said the right few words to get him to open up a few years earlier.
This should get 100000000x up votes and hopefully remind us all that it’s the little things that matter most
This is why you treat everyone you encounter with respect.
There are people like this, and people who expect free cake on their birthday
I’m not crying you’re crying
I cried!
Humans being bros/friends :3
They look British
My heart!!!
Meanwhile death stare from woman near the window.
She seems absolutely gorgeous. I'm so glad the employees care enough about her to do something for her.
The people at the table behind her are not impressed.
This put a smile on my face, what a nice surprise
Aw! Love it!
I'm not crying, you'r crying.
aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww
her energy levels are far from regular!
Awwwwwwwww
Instant love!
Some people simply deserve the world
r/humansbeingbros
Gifs that end too soon...       ??
I’m not crying your crying
It's the little things people. This is what it's all about
Husband was turning around to see where his cake was
Goddamnit. It’s just so real and precious. We need SO MUCH MORE of this in today’s world. I literally can’t even.
Aww the best and the cutest reaction ever. I so wish I could give her that surprise to get that smile on her face.
She doesn't look like the kind of person who wants her face splashed all over the internet. But hey, you get that karma.
GOD BLESS REGULARS 😭💜
Hit me right in the feels
Reminds me of my mom
Too sweet. True happiness. Made me smile.
This is so precious and sweet that it hurts me.
Please does somebody have a source to the vid please
first time going to the popular section and AWWWW
Happy bday ma’am!
Why did I just start crying?
Oh my gosh 😍 bless her heart! Happy birthday!
I can’t stop watching this.
was having a shitty day, this made it better. Sweet old lady!
This is so adorable! And she looks genuinely surprised and happy
That’s really sweet.
I love this post and thread. So wholesome.
This is nice to see.
This literally warmed my heart, a big o happy birthday to her!!
Damn it, that's real nice.
Super cute
Came to post she was adorable but I see someone else already said that. I love her. I could watch this forever!
I'm older than the Reddit crowd but please give your mom, dad and grandparents a call.  If you had that friends that passed give their parents a call.  It means the world to them.
Sooo sweeet
That is SO. PRECIOUS.
warming
This is why a service/hospitality is a real job. There’s few things as rewarding as making someone’s day like this. Tip your servers, people! -service industry professional
I miss my grandma
I'm gonna fucking die that's so adorable. I wish her 100 more happy birthdays.
That lady is nicer than I’ll ever be. What an innocent human.
You all make me belive that life is worth continuing on for...
How sweet and sad at the same time. She's obviously not used to being showed such special attention. She is very precious. Happy Birthday!!!
Gorgeous
She definitely gives good hugs and smells like cookies.
I almost cried this is too sweet.
Oh no now I’m going to cry, that’s too precious.
I want to take care of her!!! Now!!!! :(Hope she has a family that loves her and treats her well!! ;___;
 Aww I want to give her a hug, she is so sweet!
She is so cute. :)
i'm gonna cry
There still is good in this world and people who deserve it—thank you!
Amazing how just by looking at her body language we can know exactly how happy she is
Love.
Mah heart. Mah souuuullll. This legitimately makes me cry though
I need a subreddit for videos like this where you see the inner kid. This video, there was that video a while back where an older woman was given a new stove, dad gets a puppy...all those videos where it makes no difference whether the person is 5 or 85, the reactions are the same.
Aww this video makes me smile. :)
Wow she seems pretty happy, you can expect at least a 5% percent tip this time!
MY HEART OMG
A little cake and love can go long way
Very cute. She has this kinda Howls moving castle Witch of the waste look about her.
That is so nice
If she was an aunt of mine I'd visit her everyday
This is way too sweet :) I hope she had a wonderful birthday!
I cannot hear anything— Is it just me?
Kinda makes me feel sad, like that's the first time in a while that someone has done something nice for her. Glad it made her happy. Ought to happen more.
this brightened my day. thanks for sharing.
I've worked in restaurants for years, and its moments like these, and customers like her, that make it bearable. Too often the restaurant industry shows the worst in mankind, but there are always those people out there that are simply wonderful.
The only person who doesn't hate restaurant staff singing happy birthday
I want her to hug me.
This makes me miss my mom. She hasn't passed away but has moved out of state.
This makes me happy
You can tell the waitress really loves her, too, and the little Yiayia goes in for a hug right away, gahhh I love this so much I can’t deal with it.
I’m not crying, you’re crying!
Sticking cameras in their faces negates these acts
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.
I paused it at the perfect time. https://imgur.com/oHV6cN9
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.
Awe so sweet
This reminds me of me mum.
Fella's just looking back to see if he gets a piece too.
That is the exact same face my mother is excited to the point of overwhelmed about something
This is so wholesome!
we as younger people always take/took it for granted. well, at least i did. she probably hasn't had anyone make a big deal about her birthday in years. you can tell by her reaction. what a sweetheart.
Wish someone did this for me on my cake day :(
I love people like this.
So there is some faith in humanity
How couldn’t this make anyone happy
Please leave us a big tip.I’m just trolling. This is fucking adorable!
I like her
I love this.
Awwwww! Just a real person in a real moment of her own real life! So sweet!
So sweet
I can't up vote this enough. She's too cuuuuuute.
Ok done. Now let’s hit the next joint for free cake!
Why am I crying?
I literally shed a tear so stinkin cute
The free cake was worth it.
Sometimes getting a present isn't about how much big and expensive it is, but the gesture
Bless her angel heart!
She’s my favorite person of the day.Her husband takes second place for his clear confusion.
Is this in England?
This has gone so wholesome... thanks all, sometimes I feel silly cause I got so much feels.  Nice to know I'm not alone.
This restored some of my faith in humanity
God that's so wholesome I could die.
Oh my gosh old people are my favorite
Love her!
That woman at the very back seems like she's grimacing.
This is the most heartwarming thing I’ve seen all year; I must hug that woman.
I wish everyone I bought dessert to reacted like this... but then again not because I would probably cry!
That's pretty sweet.
My heart just melted!
Welp I cried.
I want a hug!!
Little shit like this sticks with people
It’s amazing how such little things can often mean so much to others.
not me.....I see that comming I'm out the back door
r/adorableoldpeople
Where’s my cake?
Does anyone have a source by chance?
I just want to put her in my pocket.
Good God this makes me so damn happy.
That is just the sweetest old lady!
Hehe the little apology at the end is too cute
Aww, everyone is so happy!
I gotta say when my day just ends up being the usual malaise of depression and sadness, I can always come here for a little "pick-me-up"! The smile on her face and the overall love in this video just makes the world seem brighter. To anyone out there feeling a little down: I love you and I hope things get better!
That's what makes us humans after all
"Teeheehee, its not even my birthday"
ITS.......SO......WHOLESOME
Bad ass
Little acts of kindness is what we are missing?  (Without a narcissistic, monetary reason, judgmental,  self-centered reason.)
Sweet grandma 💜💜💜💜
This is the cutest grandma I have ever seen
Aw! This warmed my heart. So sweet.
She's not my grandma, but...Happy Birthday! I love you grandma
 I can see the little girl  come out of her.
I’m crying
This is precious 😍
😭😭
Pure innocence warms your heart
Omfg I love her so much
The people in the back are [not impressed](https://imgur.com/gallery/s2oTmb0)
How sweet!!
Do greay
THATS SO CUTE
She appreciates the “Happy Birthday” more than the cake.
Old people like the simple things. My grandma just likes to leave the house.
Yeah, but to be fair, she knows these people. This isn't the situation the posts have been talking about. 20 servers stampeding to your table and singing some shitty birthday song knockoff is a different situation.
I could probably watch this forever...
She reminds me of my mom. My mom would have the same reaction.
I hope she had a good birthday
Grandmas kiss everyone.  I love it.
This reminds me of my Nana... She was a regular everywhere. Thanks for posting.
Nothing gets me more than a good customer service story.
Sometimes it’s just nice to be thought of and feel appreciated
Much better than a group of idiots coming out to sing happy birthday.   Cringe to the max
Oh my god, both her AND her (?)husband are so freakin' cute and make me wish I could adopt them as grandparents.
#MY FEELERS
I'm not crying. You're crying!
I got free ice cream on my birthday today.
The most wholesome fucking thing I’ve ever seen
Ccutteee
Happy cake day! 🍰
She seems sweet but I do believe it's just an ability to act out your emotions effectively. I don't always express my body language effectively or appropriately and therefore I believe I can be misunderstood.
As a long time server, regulars are what make our jobs worthwhile. She reminds me of a few of my own.
I am sobbing profusely
Definitely a british reaction
I love her and I hope her birthday was magical
my heart is melting. damn you grandma for being so adorable!
The world needs much more of this on social media!
Anyone else want to give that lady a nice 1-2min hug... she seems like such a sweet woman.
Aw, I wish her all the best
Awe, you can tell she’s an extremely nice woman. She looks so grateful that they are giving her cake and a gift. Good on you restaurant workers, the little things can mean so much to people and it shows right here.
This so cute I’m kinda crying and I have a beard we normally don’t do that
I've never cried at a Reddit post, but fuck this just did it.
She is adorable 😍
This makes my heart happy
I’m 39  a yo man,now on a train.I’m having tears watching this.
She is darling. What a pure human bean
Omg so cute!
It's not her birthday, she just wanted a free coffee 38 years ago and it's too late to back out now
Cake.
I love this, she fully embraced it. Whereas if this happened to me in a restaurant, I would be cringing with embarrassment.I need to lighten up!
What the world needs now... is love sweet love
Love your neighbors. Just like this Very cool We can all do this for someone
This is so pure.
Sometimes it takes so little to make someone happy.
I love this.
This is me when I get free anything
This feels like the response of someone who doesn't receive this sort of affection much anymore. Here's to hoping I am wrong.
Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday.
God I feel like such an asshole avoiding elderly people, the ones I encounter at my work place are usually horrible so it makes it difficult. Her reaction makes her seem like an angel compared to them. BRAVO TO THAT RESTAURANT YALL GOT ME CHOKED UP AND SHIT
This is the sort of thing that can cause me, a grown man, to break down. People don't realize how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone. You can see it in this woman's eyes what this meant to her. I'll never know this woman, but her joy is infectious. This is purely wholesome. Thank you, OP.
If it went on any longer it would have landed on r/mademecry
Awww so adorable
This made me smile!
She deserves it. How sweet!
Cake Day!!
That’s so sweet!!! Look at that lady mean mugging in the background. 😂 She’s like I want some damn cake too.
Please hug me.
Have no idea when this was taken but it’s my birthday today. I’m so happy to “share” this day with such a cute lady! I hope she felt just as loved and blessed as I felt today.
I know this comment will get buried but this gif made me so happy. Her genuine joy and gratefulness reminds me of my late grandma. I forgot how much I missed her but this short clip was able reminded me of the all the good times we had
She was really touched & surprised. It was genuine. It was appreciated
I want to hug this sweet lady!
God Bless Them
Heartwarming indeed.
Oh God, I'm too drunk for this :')
that looks like someone who has been having hard times and just needed to feel appreciated. thank you young ladies!
This is the cutest video I’ve ever seen in my life thus far :) she is so happy!
I'm sitting here eating fried hot dogs with Charley and I come across this video.  Good stuff for me ...
Everyone deserves kindness and love
AWWWW
Oh my god I want to give her a free cake every day
This made me cry. I used up waitress and we had some elderly regulars that definitely came in to loved and treated like family. We’d chat with them, hug them, and take pictures with them. When you get shit on by customers and are feeling down you really look forward to your regulars that help you remember you are good at your job and you make a difference to people (and they make a difference to you too.)
It's so beautiful & sweet. I'm sitting here teary eyed!
Im hard if hearing and lip read. Pretty sure she says “dont cry” as she wipes away her tears. 😭
This made my day
Aww ❤️ In the service industry, there are certain people who come along and make it worth it. She must be so genuinely kind for them to do that for her.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Holy crap this is the best thing I’ve seen all week.
She is so cute!
Oh I hope I can make someone that happy one day.
Do people just get adorable as they get older? Is it something like how we perceive babys as cute?
As someone who works in the service/retail industry... I fucking LOVE customers like this lady. That smile alone... I will bend over backwards for super sweet and just nice customers. It makes my whole day when someone comes in who doesn't really know me but treats me like an actual person. I have some great conversations with customers like this. If you want to avoid the pesky salesperson... ask them how their day is going. And then maybe you'll come in to some cake yourself one day
That lady is just adorable. She must be so kind and loving.
Oh my word. This made me cry. She looks exactly like my friend's Mom who just died unexpectedly. Her mannerisms were identical to this sweet lady. She always made sure we ate. We ate lots of cookies and cake. She'll be missed.
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!
You're not crying, I'm crying.
These are the moments that make service industry bearable
Why does she feel intensely?
I can't tell if she is touched by the gesture or if she just gets obsessively excited over seeing cake (like I do)
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYINGI NEED TO PUNCH A BABY
I don’t know her but I LOVE her.
My heart just melted...small thing but made her day!
Actually said “aww” out loud at this
Fuck that is lovely.
She looks just like my grandmother. Anytime someone did something kind, she would always hold her hands to her face just like that. Love ya Grandmasota!
Am I... Am I the only one crying? cute old people are so good at making me cry.
She is the cutest.
She's so cute,  I want to give her a hug
You guys should be proud of your lovely establishment
I loved some of my regulars at my last job. They made it worth it sometimes.
Why we are here.
Some days I wish I could be half as happy as this woman
Oh my god, that's so heartwarming. Made my day.
How could you not cry imagine if this was your grandmother
My heart is going to explode due to wholesomeness
This reminds me that everybody deserves love
She’s adorable. We all agree. I’m going to shout out to her befuddled gentleman just going with the flow. Good man there.
I love this! :)
I miss my grandmas :')
Jesus
Awwww
Duuuude! I'm fuckin crying
If you still have a grandma, call her, call her as much as you can. Grandmas love that shit. Don't miss out on that bond if you have the option.
I love her.    #: ]
She's so cute, that reaction is so adorable.
She is so adorable 😘
Yes I cried. But I also noticed that that cake looks not too appetizing lmao
OSOPRECIOUS
Makes you think. A birthday to me is nothing to be excited about. A birthday to someone else is something special.
Humans are interesting, aren't they!!! She is so cute 😀
This is what makes my soul smile.  Thanks reddit.
So cute 😊😊😊😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
As a 29y/o man, this woman is everything I want to be.
THAT, is what America is supposed to be    .
Wholesome moments are nice
r/MadeMeSmile
This made me aww out loud
Man I can't take this right now, over here bout to make me cry fuck
That's the nicest thing I've seen this morning on the internet, other than a 🐕 video.
I lover her!!!!
I miss my mum
This is what makes the world go around. Love.
Omg that is too sweet.
That so cute, a cake and a gift. But I would also add that her husband looks like Warren Buffett.
Not just cake though, also a gift.
[deleted]
This is exaclty who I want to become when I grow up 😊
So cute
Good to be nice to people. Dont really need to film it though.
She looks like she gives the warmest, most welcoming hugs.
Loved this post!!
She is so stinking cute!
This lady reminds me of my grandmother, just pure love. Call your grandparents and tell them you love them.
Her little tremble and the hands clenched under her face.  She is adorable.
She is so precious.
Holy fuck that made me smile
I want to give her a hug. I hope she had a fantastic day.
She’s precious!!!! Look at her reaction 😭💕❤️ agh ma heart
So many serve safe violations, but the joy just over takes it!!
Damn. This is the snuggliest thing. Love it.
I’m not crying my eyes are just sweaty
This hits home more than I can say. I work at a restaurant between jobs currently. Ive realized even more so the smallest things can make a difference in someone’s day. I now try to do little things for people to make them feel good. There’s no better feeling!
Sooooo cute
Beautiful
As a server that just got off a terrible shift this really made my night!
Just wonderful. Tell her 67,000 people reacted to it
Thanks Reddit
I buried my great grandma today and this really reminded me of some great memories, thank you internet stranger.
Plot twist, Hallmark commercial
This sort of love that's pure and straight out of the heart without expecting anything in return is very rare
I love some of our regulars that come to the casino where I work.
Hell I didn't smile I cried :')
Melted my heart. You can see she was sincerely touched.
I am a hormone casserole right now and this got me sobbing. These kinds of interactions give me faith in humanity <3
So precious
She looks like a grandma in a children’s book. So cute.
YOU BASTARDS JUST ALMOST BAD ME CRY! My eyes all tested up and shit!!!!!!! 😭
God she is so adorable I'm going to melt.
This is SO EFFING heartwarming, watched it a million times already! Old people are the future of this world! and that's the tea, sis.
Aw how sweet!
I watched this at least 20 times straight
I'm crying.
Wow I love her so much.
Aww this is so cute
Man!  If that’s what a regular customer gets, I wanna see what a special customer gets.
My father in laws birthday is 21st of next month what to give him!
It's always wonderful to see a kind hearted staff in a restaurant.
Good bless her soul!🤗
I've never seen this many upvotes on a post yet.. And that lady is adorable
Got her! r/unexpected
To all the people that has birthday today, I wish you happy birthday.
That’s awesome
Humble people makes the act of giving so much fun.  Lovely.
Awww wholesome
Instantly lifted my mood!
I recently quit my job because they refused to do anything like this for both long time customers and employees. I dig it.
That smile just warms your heart
So sweet
Jesus eff. Stop. That was beautiful.
heart touched
I love her so much she's so adorable ugh 😣❤️😭
Why am I CRYING
Adorable 💜
I want that joy!
This reminds me of the diner my papa used to frequent on a daily basis! The ladies that worked there just loved him dearly. They even let him bring in and keep his very own coffee cup in the diner. After he passed, they closed the diner to attend his funeral. They would do special things for his birthday(s), too. So sweet, just like this post. This lady is so overjoyed, she has tears! I love people that look out for the elderly. This lady is so sweet!
This is so wholesome and I love it!
So sweet!
This is amazing!
What a sweet moment (‘:
This is why you take care of the good people, not the jerks looking for free stuff.
wow. This was kinda touching. I'm still not crying though....sniffle.
This is really a peaceful moment ❤️👏
God damn, she reacted like a Disney character would. She's far older than me, yet far more innocent. I wish I was that sheltered my whole life.
Ok just fuck me up fam
this makes me miss my grandma...
Spread happiness😍😍😍
W H O L E S O M E
This melts my heart, shes so cute
Guessing this is Britain. Anyone know where?
Oh Jesus... that just warms the heart.
Love
Heart. Melted.
Love it!! That was as genuine as it comes
Nice
Adorable!
That's not a cake. That's merely a biscuit.
Kindness and appreciation. So simple yet so increasingly rare.
Haha, I’m imagining the people in the background as cute little toddlers oohing and aahing over it. Everyone here is so cute!
That’s so pleasant! 😊
Holy fuck 79k upvotes good job boys. Also this was very sweet
That's lovely,.
That reminded me of my mom
I was looking at it and got chills.  Thank God this isn’t r/Wellthatsucks
I absolutely love this
Life is sad
I love this
Oh, look, I'm weeping
Fuck this is too cute, is there anti-eye-bleach?
She looks like the lady I drove home to her senior living place.
Ultra AWWWWW!
I'm literally the old guy sitting behind her who carries along eating.
She is so sweet!!
Cute
I wish I could upvote something twice
This is so sweet. When the staff at a cafe does something like this, that's how you know she's a special customer and nice person. These people serve hundreds of people a week, if not more.
Holy adorable
Truly amazing.
That’s so sweet
I love her :))
True regulars are the best.  Even the stingy ones that you can hold a conversation with; you end up learning a lot and end up caring for them.  I honestly miss my serving life because of people like the lady and gentleman in the gif.
Who knows?
So adorable!
Awwww. I'd love to see the full video of this! So utterly adorable.
What?! No cake smash!?
Anyone picking up on that glare from the lady down at the end?
A regular waitress’s reaction too!Cuteness overload.
You can see the glamour on her face.
I love her
Old people are the wisest, most wholesome, and most adorable people I know
 I needed this today. Thank you.
The more i watch this the harder I cry
That's really sweet
Wholesome post thanks for sharing
awww she looks so grateful :’)
I love her reaction.
It's really so nice to see how happy she is. Gotta say I'm pretty jel...
It is not about the cake being free
Jesus Christ. I’ve never seen such genuine raw happiness and appreciation in my life. Amazing.
So cute 😊
This is great
See the happiness on her face, it's really really awesome. The art of happiness is to serve all. To be truly happy, we must think not only of how we can help ourselves, but how we can help others.
so precious
She looks so excited😄
This is the cutest thing I have seen on this subreddit <3
Old people are so cute.
I needed to see this right now
She's a princess that day!
She looks like she teaches botany at hogwarts ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The smallest thing can really have the biggest impact.
I love this so fucking much
The way she puts her hands together and smiles <3 I want to hug her so badly
Aww I wish there were more people like her
r/MadeMeSmile
Can I hug her?
It was my birthday (September 21st) I hope you we share the same birthday so I know someone had a good day!
The old man looks like Warren Buffett
Awww such a grateful Grammy. 🤗
The sweetness and lack of entitlement.  So lovely ♥️
I can only hope for this greatness.   I'm smiling honestly.
I love reddit!
She’s so cute!
What a sweet fucking lady 😭😭😭
I want her as my mom #2
I bet bet she gives fantastic squeeze hugs. I really want to pinch the hell out her cheeks. So stinking cute.
Sometimes I see thangs that make me wanna cry. This is one of them. Too sweet.
damn I wish my grandma looked this happy, shes normally in a static state of mean mugging but even when shes ecstatic she looks no where near as happy as her. I can't blame her with all the conditions she goes through with her body now though.
I wanted to cuddle her and protect her at all costs.
This is amazing. It gives me all the feels.
😭😭😭😭
She makes me miss my Mama so bad.
The little girl inside her is healthy and fine 😊
Little tear.  It’s just so nice seeing ppl being kind to each other.  We are attracted and exposed to so much toxicity online, but I still see more good than bad in my day to day interactions.  And this is lovely.
This is too adorable.
This makes me sad for some reason
It’s a small wor... reddit.

We all saw the behind the scenes video bro... let the doggo eat :)

Pretty sure that's cannibalism.
How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy?
Found him on @dash.dog
It’s a dog eats dog world out there.
Go Mariners!
Safeco!!
Go M’s
Being a Mariners' fan this season sure is ruff.
Hot dawg he did it!
Did he get to eat it afterwards? He nailed being adorable, he deserves compensation!
Your good boy dresses better than I do
Safeco Field
Well hot dog

can dogs eat mustard?
There's a grate-type barrier behind the dog on the frontpage GIF and there isn't on this one. Looks like the same dog, bandana, and hat but might be a different game.
LITERALLY THE PPST BELOW THIS ONE IS THE VIDEO OF THE PHOTO BEING TAKEN LOL
Lol, I saw a vid of this being taken. Glad to see it worked out!
When a Reddit fan captures a Reddit fan taking pictures for Reddit!!!
[deleted]
He is a super star! He is smiling ear to ear and does not appear to mind his human dressing him up! Such a lovable face. Give him a belly rub from Karen in pennsylvania!
If you go on r/eyebleach there is a video of this guy taking this photo
I SAW THE VID WHAT A GOODBOY!!
AYE GUYSI FOUND EM
This is too many levels of meta
I swear a video of you taking this picture was just on my homepage.
So meta
How many hot dogs were harmed in the making of this photo?
The final product is just as good as the behind the scenes.
Awww! I just saw a video of this good boy trying not to eat the hot dog!
Does this count as r/tworedditorsonecup ??
This is right above the video of the guy watching you get the shot in my feed :)
 I saw these literally right next to each other
Meta.
I thought it was a Muppet at first.LOL!
HE DID IT!!!!!
How do you train or prepare a dog to not be afraid of all the lights/sounds/people?  I have a boxer pup that loves people and other animals. I would love to take him to a baseball game, however I took him to the beach and he was afraid the whole time, tail between the leg, didn't want to say hi to anyone - totally not like himself. I'm worried he would be the same at a baseball game.
The internet is an amazing thing.
I swear I saw the video of this being taken somewhere else on here.
R/aww doggin it
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again
How much did the M's lose by?
Don’t get much better than a ball game with your best friend.
Someone give this dog a brand deal!
Selfie dicipline att its finest
Im sure the woofer wouldn't be as happy if he knew the name of what was in his mouth.
As unhealthy that is, I would really like to see goodboy to eat his prize. Some closure for little people :P
Definitely better than I was expecting!!!! 10/10
Boop
You know this dog is too much like a human
lol. He started eating that hot dog 2 seconds after this was taken.
Cutest Baseball Boy Ever!!
My good boy is wicked smaht
Go Mariners!
I saw you making this photo
Oh yeah, love that dog on dog action
Alright. I need a Golden Retriever. Now.
Awwww

GOOD BOYYYYYYY
u have completed the circle thank you
The follow up we needed
“Good slave got my karma. 666/666.”
SO FERKIN GOOD
Saw the video earlier and was hoping that the guy was a Redditor. So glad he is because this picture is too freaking cute!!
MY HEART IS EXPLODING FROM ALL THE HAPPY
I was waiting for this since this morning!
Who needs a kiss cam when you've got a good boy cam?
Yo someone else got you in a video of you making this!
Is this that dog from an earlier reddit post when he was trying to get the photo?
I have sat in this section.  For a girl scout night.  We were the lucky recipients of the very top row.  This is an annual event and we had top row seats two years running.
Maybe it's just the uploaded picture but I didn't like the background focus and quality found it distracted from a good shot.  Did some quick edits to add a bit of lens blur to background and some slight balancing to reduce the highlights.https://i.imgur.com/KNK8Ufd.jpg

SOMEONE POSTED A VIDEO OF THIS PERSON TAKING A PIC OF HIS DOG AND PUT IT ON THE SAME SUBREDDIT...REDDIT-SEPTION
He's rocking that handkerchief.  12/10
The photo is cute but I can see from the behind the scenes video that your dog is overweight. Feeding him bread, cheese, sugar (in the sauce), and overfeeding are all bad for him. Especially since this breed characteristically overeats if they can. Please look after your pup by keeping him healthier.
You sound suspiciously like a dog, OP.
All American pup.

HOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I've seen him before🤔🤔
Is that ketchup on that hot dog?!
That picture was almost worth the $10 hot dog.

So cute. Cant believe the dog can just do that naturally. Real talent!
Hot Dog!
I was waiting on this to hit the front page after seeing the vid
You da real MPV, I was dying to see the actual photo!
Best photo on the internet right now paws down
The video is so good
A ROOBY ROOBY ROOOOOOOO!!!!!!
DOG eats Hot DOG. A little strange......
PHOTO DOG!!
I needed this closure
I was at the game. This pup dominated the big screen!
Link to original?
Amazing
Oh my god I was so sad that I couldn’t see the finished product!
How does this dog have more willpower than I do?
Cognitive dissonance at its finest
Should make this my tinder picture lmao
Someone took a video of you taking this photo and upload it to Reddit
Where did the fence go?
Knew this was Safeco immediately. I might need a hobby that isn't baseball.
wait, isn't this the video?
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there
Awwwwww
I get that reference
I saw I video of you taking the picture
If you look at the gif, then the picture, they are two different dogs... and sadly two different hot dogs :(
Did you let him eat it?
I wonder what the convo was like between the owner of the dog and the other guy who was recording him take the picture. He probably made the front page and told him to post it.
omggg all that hard work was worth it!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/9djypy/good_boy_trying_his_hardest_to_pose_with_food_at/?utm_source=reddit-android

Worth the hassle in the video!
casually scrolled down front page and saw another person's post of you taking this picture of your good boye hahahha

I really do love Reddit.
Saw a video of you guys from above and left
Most exciting thing I've seen at a baseball game.

Canabilism
I was at that game and close to your row
Go Ms!
I want there to be a video of the guy taking the video of the guy taking a picture of this dog please.
My webcam has more of a life than I do.
Thanks for posting from this angle.👍

I saw the video of this being taken earlier and thought  "I *neeeeed* to see the actual photo". So happy to have that happen.God, I love dogs.
Bahahaha I literally watched a video where someone filmed the dude who took this picture
Minute made baby
Hi is hat doge your is riyal
My man is an eagles fan, let’s get itEdit: wait I’m retarded forget it 😪
Bark at the Park?
Was waiting for the actual pic....definitely 10/10 🤩
I saw the photo, later saw the video, and frantically scrolled back up so I could upvote and comment.
If you don't put this on a shirt you are wrong 10/10, my friend.
Good god this guy tried so hard for this
I saw your evil torture
I saw him on Dogspotting earlier!!!!! Omg
Get this hecking good boy some belly rubs, now
Holy shit I don’t believe it... someone recorded you taking this exact picture and posted it here
Damn, top comment is 15,000 upvotes and they deleted it? Wtf
132,000 upvotes. That’s the most I’ve ever seen. (I’m only 8 months or whatever in)
What do you call a dog in the summertime?
I just saw someone post a video getting this shot.
Why have kids when you have dog?
Yellow labs really are the best ^_^
Wait what is there a glitch in the matrix, cause i saw this dog and owner trying to get this pic...omg to real
What an amazing story, my heart just swelled 100 times over. That was  not a human man, he truly was an angel in disguise, God Bless everyone involved, the ones who experienced ,read, shared, and reposted  this wonderful story. May this world be blessed with more Angels like that Angel.
Man, how did you manage this pic?   Do you have video of this being set up?
10/10 is a sadly low rating. I'd say more like 12 or 13/10
I saw the "making of" gif on r/eyebleach and am so glad the finished result on here too!!
This dog might be the best dog ever.
Wait, isn't the process of taking this picture on r/woof_irl? https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/comments/9djyr4/woof_irl/?utm_source=reddit-android
There's any other pic which was u taking the picture of the dog
Different photo/place, doesn't have the fence behind him that was in the video.
I feel like this pup is taking his grandpup to his first ball game haha
u/seattlemana
Your dog looked obese in the other video, feed him better or he might not be around for that much longer.
This is what it means to be an American. Golden Retriever with a hot dog at a ballpark.
Love it !!!!
What sound does a dog make with a hairlip Mark mark
He had blue cotton candy too, didn't he?

Nice photo, cute dog
Ahh look at that cute dog!!
100% a good boy
This is the single greatest photo I've ever seen 10 out of 10
That is one HOT dog.
Hold on I just saw a video on r/aww of this exact video being taken!?!
I hope he didn't eat any mustard that's a big no no for doggos
So can the redditor who took this picture, and the redditor who took a video of this guy taking a picture just kiss already? Meet, have dinner together....Clearly you two have a cute love for baseball doggo in common so..

The hot dog looks very fake to me.
Next have him chugging a twelve dollar beer!
Photography is the story I fail to put into wor
Good dog got to enjoy his good dog right after this.
He got the photo but did he get to eat the hot dog?
This is GREAT! A wee piece of doggo internet history. Hope you gave him a heckin pettin afterwards.
This is why I love reddit.
Safeco field?
Did someone really spend 20 bucks on a stadium hot dog for their dog to eat?!
Too bad it's over exposed.
Title gore
I swear that I just saw a video of someone recording you reading this photo
A redditor taking a video of another redditor taking a picture of his dog. Mind blown
am I the only one who saw the video of this pic being taken XD
I feel no different about this picture than I would about a picture of a fat man, taken at the worst possible angle, holding a hot dog in his mouth, which is also crusty and dripping with saliva. This is disgusting. Why is this on the front page?
m e t a b o y e
I smell a ruse
Can someone provide a side-by-side of this and a screen shot from the video? Something looks different and I can’t figure out what. I’m on mobile and it’s not going well.
Dog eat dog world
How many hotdogs did this take?
Wait theres no gate behind, how many hotdogs did he eat that day?!?!?!?!?!
🐱‍🐉
Oooo that looks like such a tasty dog I obviously meant the hotdog
Awesome
Is this cannibalism?
Hey I saw you in the parking lot earlier, that's how I know you.
There's no fence behind him like in the video we just saw. How often do you do this?
Safeco field yeah? Beautiful stadium
$10/$10
****M E T A****
I sure as hell hope that good boy enjoyed his hot dog!!  He earned it!
My longest gud boi ever
I'm having fits just imagining how many places the ketchup and mustard may have gone. That's going to be one dirty boy.
337 = EET
Impressive - that's impressive stamina to NOT gobble up that hot dog.
This goodest of boyes deserves all the treats
What a good good boy!
Goms
Bark at the park!!! True to the blue...
The bestest boy ever
Go Astros!
The hat! 😍
can doggos have ketchup and mustard?
Ew, who puts ketchup and mustard on their hotdog.
Next stop r/photoshopbattles
I really want to see him finally scarf that thing down!
Love the single dark whisker on his face 😍
Doggoop
taaaaaake me out to the baaaaaall gaaaaaame
I think this pup got more than one hotdog, the background is different in the video that was just posted.
Go M’s!
When did this sub started to allow canibalism?
Cannibalism
how did you get a dog into a ball park lol?
He better have let him eat that hot dog!
They allow dogs at the baseball field? That’s cool 😎
That's gonna be a pretty damp hot dog

Considering the price of stadium food, this might be OPs most expensive picture of their dog!

I think this is a different photo from the video. The video had that gate/grate behind him.
Nigga I watched the video of this... knowing later id see that gorgeous face =) !!!
DID HE GET TO EAT THE DOG AFTER?!
If he didn't get to eat that hotdog imma go John Wick on your ass.
Some say he's the goodest boy around
Is this canabilism
Is the hotdog real
Was probably a $12 hotdog
That's a nice fuckin dog.
This is cannibalism.
What a GOOD BOY!!  Wish I could give him hugs!!!
Safeco Field!
HE IS THE EPITOME OF HAPPINESS
MARINERS DOGGO IS HAPPY. This came out so well too! This is adorable! Pup's probably happy with a good game, a good frank, awesome owner, and the W they got haha.
Amazing
he has toothpaste on his beard
The hat just makes the whole picture perfect I can’t 😂
Maybe this cute pooch could get the mariners to the playoffs.

How many hot dogs has that dog held in its mouth? The other picture had a railing/fence behind it./r/Eyebleach/comments/9djypy/good_boy_trying_his_hardest_to_pose_with_food_at/
My dog would just gobble the whole thing up.
12/10 doggo. 7/10 shot, should've positioned that giant light behind his head.
Feeding a diaper hotdog is so bad. Esp one with cheese
I get that it's cute but why are people okay with this? Doesn't it feel kind of scummy to use your pet in this way?
The best boy!!
I love how people just love animals. Nature’s way of giving human beings 100% natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety solution through unconditional love.
Best ... Day ... Ever
Hey wait a second!! This picture was taken from a different location than the video we all just saw! Did the good boy get 2 separate hot dogs? Did you take the first one out of his mouth and, then move to a different spot!?
The original Post can be found under instagram: @dash.dog
Someone took a video of you trying to get this photo. I saw the effort of the dog trying his best to not eat the hotdog. Glad the photo turned up perfect.
A happy Mariners Dog!!
Dodger Dog!
Who is a good boy?You are a good boy!
Yay!! This is what I needed after seeing the other post!
This has made my day!
Go M’s!
Hope he got to have that as a treat!
The guy was trying to get the Mariners logo in the shot but failed. I'd say 9.5 out of ten, but good boy is still good
Gotta love a walk in the park
Let's go Mariners! Let's go Good Boyes
Good boy!
Someone clipped the process of doing this what a obidient dog
Go mariners!
This is an amazingly good boi I have to guard my dog from stealing MY hotdogs, no way I could have every managed this with any of the dogs that have been in my life.
He made it to the HOME page!Get it guys? Home? GET IT?
do dogs like mustard?
Can confirm from prior content; My heart is now a puddle.
This is so cute. And I love that it’s at my home stadium. I wanna go to Bark in the Park so bad, but I can never make it. He looks like such a good boy!
Best ballpark hotdog salesman ever!
Thank you, I was left on edge
HOw'd you get him to not eat it long enough to take a picture?
Adorable!
How'd you put food in a Golden's mouth and not get them to devour the whole thing in .2 seconds?
What team was this?
What a beautiful photo! Well earned hot dog I'd say!
I certainly hope that good boy was allowed to eat the hot dog after posing so patiently.
“Photos taken moments before disaster”
I was at Safeco yesterday!  Simba cam was funny.
Is that mustard
THERE WAS A WIRE FENCE BEHIND DOGGO IN THE VIDEO, WHERE IS IT IN THIS PICTURE!?!?!?!?
May your goodboye never be hit with the sog.
It's a dog eat dog world.
Priceless!!!!!!
Drooling hot dog boy!!So cute!!
This is adorable. He's ready for the game now.
Just saw the vid of someone recording the gentleman and his pupper in this pic!! r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
I saw the video like an hour ago and I was thinking I really would enjoy seeing that photo he took. And you delivered! Amazing! What a freaking cutie! Bravo!! 👏
Must be a different dog. The video showed a metal fence behind it. Sorry guys.
I like how a good boy with a hot dog acquired more up votes then Burt Reynolds dying Lmao
Pretty sure that has to be some sort of mental torture...Nice cap though
Yassssss!
Why on earth do the Mariners need public funding for upgrades to one of the best parks in the league? Doesn’t the city have a major homeless problem?
I read in my dog training manual that dogs do not like mustard.  In fact, if you put mustard on a cracker somewhere-- they will condition themselves to not taking treats that are left out.    Just thought I should point out that dogs don't like the same flavors we do.
Feed Nana
Been waiting for this all day
help this is too darn CUTE
Doggo?
ok i just saw a photo of a man at a ballpark trying to take the perfect picture with his dog. Is this the sequel?
Finally got some closure.

I wish the Jays had Bark in the Park!
This is not the photo from the video... there’s a cage background on the video..How many attempts did the owner make?
This is cool because he's not swimming in a pool of drool.  Dog has control!
My dog would have eaten that hotdog in at least 0.2947 seconds
The self control alone gets a 10/10, good boiiiii ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That's just plain MEAN!!! You had better let him eat that hotdog once you got your dang picture!!
That stadium reminds me of AAMI Park in Melbourne

My dog would straight chomp down on that hot dog as soon as I gave it to him. I tried and tried and tried some more to get him to balance a treat on his nose to no avail.

Safeco field! I'll be there Saturday.
A hot dog eats a hotdog.
is that unhealthy for a dog?
Safeco does a bark in the park night?
They allow dogs in stadiums now?
Love that this was at Safeco
Isn’t it bad form to feed dog to a dog?  I always feel bad eating fish near my aquarium
Damm look at those condiments!
The owner is just this dog’s selfie stick
\*iz baseball\*\*iz goodboye\*
This picture is impressive on so many levels!
Cute and beautiful
Safeco is a gorgeous stadium, in a gorgeous city
I swear to god if he wasnt allowed to eat the hot dog I am hunting that owner down.
Has OP seen the video of him taking this picture?

Should dogs eat hotdogs?  I've heard the salt isn't good for dogs, so Ziggy doesn't eat any hotdogs, am I right about this?
Good boy did
Holy shit! This is hands down the best mind fuck thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit. If you know others throw me

When will cannibalism end

Big baby!!!!! Of whom I love
There was a honeycomb looking fence behind doggo in the other video. Just sayin'. Still cool.
I know the Mariners are a little behind in the Wild Card race, but that is a super empty Safeco Field. Come on, Seattle fans!
That hot dog must be ridiculously **soggy** after waiting so long for the perfect moment.
is it safe for a dog to eat all those ingredients

To hi to ghh
.
I met this dog at the game last night. Can confirm, goodest boy.
It's dash!!!
Hate to be that guy but theres no reason to put ketchup and mustards on a dog treat (i'm pretty sure mustard isn't good for dogs anyway) Very cute picture though
Do this at a stadium in one of the multicultural parts of Western Europe and people will be constantly asking/telling you to keep your dog away. I can't go to the park with my dog without seeing some scared weirdos run across the street to get away from my small dog.
Get’em while they’re hot!
GOMS
Yaaaaassss
Ryder the golden retriever lol
What a rollercoaster of emotion
well hot dog!
Video of you taking this
I just want to point out that the hotdogs at safeco are like $15 a pop so thats 15 bucks right there
They let dogs into baseball stadiums??
Fuck I want a hot dog now
Go M's!! I think we're losing..
This was a bad thing.
Bark at the park! Go Ms!
Go Mariners!
Safeco! Hell yes!
IN CONTROL
I love reddit.
I love Reddit.
Follow this dog on instagram!!! He has a lot of cute pictures. He’s Dash.dog
Best good boy
Oh wow! That's a good boy right there!

This good boy is responsible for a collective 150,000 karma at the time of this comment
Minute Maid park?
This good boy is all over fb
Different spot tho
101k upvotes and gold.Its a picture of a fucking dog.Someone spent money on this.
U/SeattleMana posted a vid of this being taken
That's adorable!!
There better be no onions in that hot dog!
TIL you can take dogs to the baseball park.
such a good boy. im glad he got to enjoy a sodo dog with lots of ketchup and mustard! well deserved.
Mariners Field?
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again
I can't believe you bought a $25 hot dog for this.
Good boye loves his M’s
Small world indeed
RESPECT... even I would have ate the hotdog before the picture.
These here were my worry when I was a kid thinking dogs would think we were eating dogs so I called them franks and such this is a really good picture too thankyou for sharing this too
u/SeattleMana
Of course he’s a resditor
Is that nacho cheese of mustard? If it’s nacho cheese that boy knows how to dog :)
How can the dog not eat the hotdog right away ?
Wasnt there a fence behind the dog in the video? I guess they tried another spot
Yeah, good boy
He needs his own pair of shades!
Sir, that is a Wookiee.
Punch it, Chewie!
"This is Ben. Ben thinks he's people. But Ben also has a job at the local Starbucks and has his own 401k, so he's probably not wrong."
Who is the dog?
Ben is a good boy who unlocks the use of the carpool lane.
Elwood Blues: It’s 106 miles to Chicago, we’ve got a full tank of gas, half a pack of milk bones, it’s dark out and we’re wearing sunglasses.Jake Blues: Hit it!
More pics please
That's a cool human you got there. What breed is he?
This dog looks like "The Dude"https://i.imgur.com/R7DvL1v.jpg
Chewie?
What kind of dog is Ben? He looks like a shaggier giant version of my mutt-of-unknown-provenance.
My dog's name is Ben. I have a beard but he does not.
Why are Chewbacca and Kevin Smith hanging out together?
Is this the dude from duck dynasty
He is awesome!!!
He looks like the dude, man.
Ben needs a brow trim bro, he can't see the funny looks you guys get lol
You're probably overwhelmed with replies, but I wanted to say thank you.Ben made me laugh during an upsetting nerve pain episode. Snortles were produced. You both made my day a whole lot better :)Please put a Chewbacca bandolier on him.How much does he weigh?
The guy looks like youtuber Shay Carl.
His leash even looks like Chewbacca’s ammo belt
HOV Lanes HERE I COME!!
What breed?
What a handsome dog.I heard dogs which have hair covering their eyes sometimes are afraid of walking around because they can't see very well.If he moves around very carefully you should try to give him a hair cut, it wont harm him and when it doesn't improve anything for him it'll grow back.Any way give him some bellyrubs from me.
That seatbelt makes him look like Chewbacca 😂Edit: Just figured out it was a leash 😂
More pics please
I'd follow that dog's advice
[Ben needs the Wookiee seatbelt!](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/chewbacca-seatbelt-cover/)
You got him so you could ride in the carpool lane didn’t you?
And he has a lovely dog too!
Which one is Ben?
And you let him drive?
Anyone else think that was Chewbacca??
Can he fix the hyperdrive?
Whats the dog's name?
Punch it Chewie!!
Prince Eric called. He wants his dog back
Pls do that dog a favour and cut its hair. Allow him to see.
You ever dress up as Han Solo? You could try to use Ben as a Chewy decoy for carpool.
Looks like the Dude, in dog form
I hope you don’t take this as an insult because you have a nice beard, but damn...his is better.
Cut the hair in front of his eyes back
When you get into the car do do you say "Punch it Chewie!"?
I thought it was The Dude...man
Yup haha
If this dog could talk It would sound like Sam Elliot and give you sage advice.
Give him a cut, needs to see.
Hopefully you're on the way to the groomer to fix his bangs, that poor dog can't see.
Wrong sub, but where could someone find those shades?
Dude! You know Tim Allen?!?!
Ben The Wookie Solo
for some reason he reminds me of The Dude. he's awesome.,
"Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
Hey ben im human sized too but dont feel the need to brag about it. Thats a cool dog though.
Give him a Chewbacca utility belt and it will be largely self-explanatory.
Punch it Chewie!
Chewbacca..
I didn’t know Keemstar has a dog.
Ben looks like the kind of dog I'd like to have a beer with while coming up with some crazy business ventures we could blow our life savings on.
 You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. That cannot be a dog. That is surely a sasquatch you have taken from its native environment. Return him, or her,  to their home else a legion of sasquatches/sasquatchi/sasquatcheses (Not really sure what you call a group of these beasts, if anyone knows please enlighten me) and their sassy hats shall picket your home.  Return him, and stop using the car pool lane!
Ben has some nice sunglasses.
My dudes out here looking like Chewbacca
Please put your wife's seatbelt on!
He's a helluva co-pilot, but when it comes to locking in the auxiliary power, you'll have to tell him twice.
Chewbarka
Punch it Chewie!
Han and Chewie 2018
He needs a replica of Chewbacca's bandolier, and you got yourself a damn good cosplay k-9.
Chewie, is that you?!
I can’t be the only one who at first glance thought this was a guy in a chewbacca costume.
Yeah we get it, it's Ben, he has a beard and is human sized - but what's the name of the good boy on the left?
He needs his bangs trimmed so he can see too!
Okay and who's the dog
Cruel to put sunglasses on him though.
Dude, dog can't see.  Cut dogs hair.
... put sunglasses on him
You have to buy a right hand drive car asap. The looks gonna get even more funner.
He needs sunglasses
He is the dog equivalent of you, I love him
I'm not sure which one of you would get the most attention on /r/beards. :)
Thank you for blessing all of us with this image sir. The internet is forever grateful.
The name's Dude
Car pool laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tell him I love him please thanks
Ben also has a pretty cool dog.
Irish Wolfhound?
What type of "human" is he?
Dude perfect, anyone?
Ben's got some nice shades

I think a bandolier is in order
I thought it was someone dressed as chewie for a sec
That dude next to Ben looks like he is probably pretty good looking.
What's the dog's name?
Both handsomely gorgeous
I remember him from 2 Stupid Dogs.
Which one is Ben?
Trim the poor guys eyebrows already!!
I’ve got two sheep dogs. One is 13. He’s having a really bad day. Might be his last. Seeing this made me think about our good times though. I appreciate that.
Do you have any idea how many times I would say “Chewie! Get us outta here!” When the light turned green?
Man, ZZ Top look good for their age
Chewy? 😅
Sir do you realize there's a homeless man in your passenger seat... Oh, never mind!
Keemstar is that u???
Totally thought you were a guy I used to bang for a moment.Anyway, er. Hi ben!
still not sure which one posted this
KEEMSTAR?
I believe you have own a wookie good sir. Not a dog
Brother!
Chewie? Is that you?
Carpooling right
This guy nailed this picture. Context need not apply.
Ben’s human looks like Mike Napoli.
I am also Ben. I also have a beard. I am also human sized. However I do not get fun looks at traffic stops. Only not fun looks
Give him some sunglasses and it's jerry garcia.
Punch it Chewie!
Are you aware that your dog is chewbacca?
Punch it, Chewie.
Where can I send the beard oil? Take your pick at [Labrador Supply Co](https://www.labradorsupply.co/collections/beard-oil)
Who’s the dog though?
Sir, your dog seriously needs sunglasses.Just like yours.That is all.
Someone Photoshop them into the Millennium Falcon please

Punch it Chewie
I thought that was Chewbacca
You look like Han and Chewie's stunt doubles
Punch it Chewie!
Man Ben needs a hair cut, cant even see all the bitches checking him out I bet.
Do you own the millennium falcon of cars? and can it do the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs??? "punch it chewie!"

Aww. We don’t deserve dogs.
Ben, what is your dogs name.
Chewbacca
Which one of you wrote this?
#youshotfirst
Ben, the two of us need look no more.  We’ve both got the beards we’re hoping for.  Ben, you always call shotgun  Which causes confusion.  But, Ben, my friend, you see,  You’re best doggo for me.
Please trim your dog hair, poor thing can’t even see
[removed]
I’ve been told it can negatively impact a dog’s vision health if their hair is long enough to cover their eyes. I know you may find it difficult to grant him eye contact as it will be nearly impossible to resist when he begs for a bite of the steak you grilled up for dinner... but it’s in his best interests in the long run (the haircut - not necessarily the steak).
never ceases to amaze me how couples look more and more line each other as they age
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.very hansom doggo
Are you wearing a zipper hoodie, a flannel shirt, and a graphic tee? Could you be more internet?
Wtf cut that dogs hair dude
This needs to be posted in r/beards too
But, but that's a wookie.
My dude....
At least trim around his eyes, otherwise i love the long hair. I always recommend sanitary shaves. Keeps the awesome hair, cleans up the nasty spots.
I so thought it was a chewie suit
He needs a groom
Get the hair out of your dogs eyes.
Ben can’t see shit
This poor dog probably can’t see through all of that hair, and has no way to communicate that fact.
LOL!!!! THAT DOG IS WEARING SUNGLASSES!
I'm gonna be the downer and say:Dude maintain your fuckin' dog's fur length because that shit looks awful for him.
Run you fools!
He looks like my uncle Donald not even joking lol
Pretty sure that’s high school nerd Scott Howard
Cool shades Ben
Far out man.
I bet he feels well like one of the lads
Needs a t-shirt
Ham solo and chewie for Halloween pics when they happen pls.
Im just impressed you can type so well with paws
Needs more bandolier
If he started speaking I wouldn't even be surprised.
Is Ben a Giant Schnauzer?
which one is the human?
I’m almost sure that if you call him by his name he will actually respond “WHAT?!”.
Which one is Ben
Chewbacca......just needs shades!
Also, Ben is on the right.
Ah filming of the new Hangover movie
I love him
[deleted]
You get fun looks 'cause you're both adorable!!!!!!
I like Ben's sunglasses.
Co-pilot needs sunglasses too.
Thats a wookie not a dog!

Ben has cool glasses
You should buy him a bandolier
You look like Jayson Werth
Um, is that Keemstar... At a StarWars set? I've seen it all.
Nah, that's Chewie.
Put sunglasses on him!
He looks like A Chewbacca
You need to get his fur cut more regularly.
"Punch it chewie!"Revs engine and shoots off
Both cute!
Ok... But what about the dog?
Buy him a pair of those sunglasses. Would look cool on him.
Do you always let him drive?
Be nice to Ben, he drives
Wear sunnies and cap. So?
He needs a crossbow and you need a black vest.
Hov for days
Wow Ben looks like the Goodest Passenger Doggo, please give him all the pets and snuggles for me!
Hey, that's just like your opinion man.
"the dog abides"

Nice to meet you Ben. What's your human's name?
Damn I like this movie poster for the new Han Solo movie! Dang like the early prototype to Millenium falcon best in class seats with heated undercarriages noice!
"Ben, the two of us need look no more.....Ben,we both found what we're looking for."~Micheal Jackson about a rat. No, really.~ And it works even better here. Bearded Ben wins life.
Hi Ben! Nice blue sunglasses you got there.
Enough about Ben, who’s the guy with the sunglasses?
And what’s the dogs name.
Good Boy
Can you do some trickshots for me aswell?
Lots of Wookie related comments here (as there should be) but I think people want to also know how often you two ride in the carpool lane without issue?
But whats the dog's name?
I need tips on how you keep that beard so glorious.
Bigfoot is real!
Hi Ben,  I'd like to know the Wookie's name.
plot twist: Ben is the one with the glasses!.
I think you guys could get away with driving in the carpool lane.
Don't you think ben would be happier getting a haircut so he doesn't have most of his vision blocked by his hair lol
What is the dog's name?
All that dog needs are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and he’s fine
Your dog looks like he's in a southern doom metal band.
You’re a babe.
Anyone know what car this is? Looking in the reflection of the glasses it looks like a citoren but I'm unsure.
Traffic? Give him some shades and get in the HOV lane
Do y'all use the same beard oil?
More pictures, please. He's lovely.
Is there a subreddit for dogs who look like their humans?
Is your dog /u/petermayhew?
[Alternate picture of him](http://clipart.toonarific.com/data/media/5/2stupid002.gif)

His house must be full of hair
I’m a maug!
How old is your majestic doggo?
One of them has no sunglasses, and the other one is named Ben.
You really should get this seatbelt cover for your passenger seat:  http://shutupandtakemymoney.com/shop/star-wars/star-wars-chewbacca-seat-belt-cover/
Hey Ben, nice dog!
You need to get a recording of Chewbacca's wookie speech and blast it on your stereo.
Any more photos?
Who’s a good handsome bearded boy? Huh buddy? It’s both of you!
My partner and I are having a disagreement.I think this is Chewie, she is very specifically saying that it is Jeff Daniels from Dumb & Dumber wearing a dog suit.Please confirm who is closer OP
Chewweeeeee!
I'd be charging that boy rent & bills.
I just realized we're eating animals. They're basically people. What have we done?

Glorious!
Chewbacca?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it; that does not make sense
It's Wilfred!

We know about Ben. Now we want to hear about the dog.
Now you need to wear a shirt with him on it and vice versa.
Does he have any abilities to heal? Serious question here...
I feel like you're driving with Jeff Bridges if he was a dog.
What kind of dog is he?
I put a sailors cap on my dog once and sat in tabs still traffic. It was by far the greatest thing I have ever done because of the looks we got.
Do you always use the HOV/express lanes?
I appreciate the fact that people really do resemble their dogs , or dogs resemble their owner. However you want to look at it.
What’s the dogs name??
Nice to meet you Ben. What’s your dog’s name?
Hi Ben, awesome dog you've got!
He is awesome but can you please let him see how awesome he looks?
I didn’t know dogs could make Reddit posts.
/u/thegospelofmark are those frogskin glasses? There totally tits 🔥🔥
If you don't start the car then dramatically say "Punch it!"  You are missing out on some golden opportunities.
Chewbacca Mom!
Which one is Ben though?!
Hey Ben, What's the dog's name?
They say dogs do look like their owners sometimes.
That’s a really good looking dog.  But I just have one question.  Wouldn’t it be best for the dog to not have hair over his eyes? I’m not a dog owner, nor do I know much about them.
It's Han and Chewy in between trilogies!
Dogs posting on reddit now... great.
Which one is Ben?
Ok Ben but what’s the dogs name?
It’s cool Ben wears mirrored sunglasses
Ok cool, so what's the dogs name
There’s a beverage here, man.

Chewie... We're home.
Lmao I thought it was a chewbacca not a dog
Chewie!
Now *that's* a dog voiced by Sam Elliot.
Chewchilla?  Where have you been??
This is Wilfred.

Poor boye can't see
Straight up looks like a Wookiee
That ain't a dog, this dude just picked up an alien. That's all.
~~K, but what is the name of the dog?~~
If I were a cop and you used the hov lane I would not ticket you
I was thinking of a Star Wars joke
Reminds me of a sunday afternoon Disney film from the 80s
Ben is the new leader of this world.
Low key thought it was chewbacca
How bad does Ben stink?
Ben the dog or dude (jk)
Reading that from the point ofview of the dog makes it even better
I have a tiny version of Ben
Get that dog a wizard hat, STAT!!
I see you taught your human to drive. Good drogo
And he can drive apparently
That dog looks like 1/3 of ZZ Top
HOV lane pass for sure

Ben looks like Norman Reedus
DJ Killer Keemstar and Chewie.

Chewbarka
Does he owe you a life debt?
Never seen a dog wear a hat backwards before.

I like Ben.
Your dog is so strangely human.. like the personality and style emanates through this photo.
Hi Ben, what’s your dogs name?
Ben can definitely smell fear.
What's the name of the other one, next to Ben, with the leash on?
That made my fucking day.
Punch it albino chewie
The dogs are taking over!!!
Subaru?
r/beard
Wish my beard was so majestic, like the dog, I mean.
Nice beard! Cute dog. 10/10
Ben sure looks like a great companion.
Oh man, what a neat dog!
gonna need a Han Solo costume here
Looks like Steve McKenna...and the one on the right does, too.  #threesheets
Wookies count for carpool lanes right?
Ben, 26Works at a micro brew. Used to be super into skiing, but ever since he bought his snowmobile he's more into that.
But what’s up with that dog?
With the shades, he looks like the fourth member of ZZ Top!
Nice
What is the guys story?
Can you please cut the hair out of his eyes? Or does he drive like that to protect his eyes?
Chewbaca?
You can probably use Carpool lane with Ben on board lol
Good boy is also good as a HOV lane companion!
Hi Ben; who is the Wookiee to your right?
I had to do a double take because you look EXACTLY like my boyfriend, I thought for a second “holy shit he finally got Reddit! But whose dog is that..??”
I'm Ben and human sized too, but since I am human, that is less interesting.
He looks like he slaps the bass
Halloween idea: Han Solo and Chewbacca
Subaru?
And his dog looks pretty cool too.
The Dude abides
If The Dude were a wookiee
What's the dogs name though?
nice shades,Ben!
I thought this was a Chewbacca cosplay.
Obviously you have to get him a hat and shades too.
Wadiyatalkinabeet?
Why isn't Chewie wearing his belt?!?
What’s the dog’s name tho
That mofo is from the Wookie planet Kashyyyk.
He is the Dude.
Pretty sure I matched with this dog on Tinder.
You've been out-bearded by your own Wookie.
Punch it Chewie!
PUNCH IT CHEWIE
Definitely be using him to use the HOV lane
Who's the guy on the left?
Is Ben from a Wookie Rescue? Gorgeous boy.
Chewie?
/r/Dogismycopilot
Which one is Ben? Which one is the OP?
Please get him a Yoda stuffed toy. I feel like he needs that.
Chewbaccaaaaaaaaaa
can he pass as a second passenger for the carpool lane?
And what's the dog's name?
Chewbacca and Mr Shaytard themselves!
My name is Ben  i am cool dude   why are you staring?   plz don't be rude  Is it my beard?  that must be why  it makes me look tough  although I'm shy   I like beef jerky    and milkbones too  i hope you love me  cuz Ben loves you
So is Ben on the right or left?
Tell Ben I love him
What’s the dog’s name?
He's doimg chewbacca
I didn't know the new Solo trailer was coming out today
Chewie!
Totally looks like Bret Hinds from Mastodon
“Chewie, we’re home.”
Nice sunglasses, Ben
You look like someone I know who lives in North Carolina... Is... That you?
I like Ben’s sunglasses.
Real life chewbacca is much more pettable
you gotta do Han Solo and Chewy for halloween
Dude in a dog suit, or dog in dude suit...?
Literally thought he was in a car with a Wookiee
Perfect for the HOV lane.
Now that, is a sexy pair.
“Laugh it up it up, furball.”
Don't you need to cut his hair around his eyes so he can see?
Laugh it up fuzzball
That dog is huge 😳
Looks like briard.
Morning SamMorning Ralph
Ben is what I want my dogs to be, but they are all females, so I guess I’m getting them Halloween beards for the truck now 😂
Ben, I can’t believe you’re letting your human drive.
That's actually chewbaca
Chewy.. I have a bad feeling about this..
He looks like the drummer from Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Chewie?
This looks great! Can’t wait for Jeff Bridges’ next movie.
What’s the dogs name ?
I'm not entirely convinced this isn't a man in a dog suit.
You look like the guy from dude perfect.
But what's the dog's name?
I hate the fuckin Eagles man! - dog probably
Ben seems nice, but what's the dog's name?
Yea and what’s with the random bearded guy on the left
Gorgeous.  My BC/shepherd/schnauzer cross had hair almost identical to this.  When she wasn't cut for a while it looked like she had big floppy socks on.
Full beard-who wore it better?
Which one is Ben?
He has glasses too
which one is Ben?
They say dogs look like their owners.
“Punch it Chewie!”
And the one on the left is a dog
U/blgke
He look shaggy, but under that beard, is a very, very good boy
What's the dog's name?
Ben needs a hat too.  Or a headband.  And some shades.
Ben looks like Bruce Vilanch.
Cool. So who's on the left?
He needs a leather sash so he can be your own personal Chewbacca.
Is it hard for him to see? No bs, I'm genuinely curious.
That beard is groomed better than mine.
Ben looks like a wise old hippie.
I love ben
Are those Recaros?
Chewie!
He looks like Chewbacca
Can’t tell who is OP.
Missed opportunity not naming him Chewbacca
Hodor
Does your dog listen to Slayer?
You guys look high af btw. I live this so much!
I can’t tell which one is supposed to be Ben from the decription
Hey at least you get to use the HOV lane!
You can drive in HOV lane.
He looks like Chewbacca's hippy uncle
Thought this was chewbacca
This is the type of dog, you put sunglasses on and then drive in the HOV lane
You guys should start a Texas blues-rock band with furry guitars!
Wait a second, is the dog talking or the owner 🤔
they say dogs look like their owners..
Your dog kinda looks like Chewbacca
Tommy Chong meets Gandalf.
Wilfred?
Wow that's awesome that you taught him how to drive a car! Ben is like your personal chauffeur now. Also, it kinda looks you have a beard as well.
He looks like a chill dude
If I was told that dog is actually the lead singer of the sheepdogs. I wouldn't ask any questions.
Put Chewbacca's bandolier on him when he's in the car xD
But what's the dog's name?
What's the dog's name?
If you combined them both they would look like Adam from Tool.
Hahaha, gotta say... this good boy has style, now he needs some sick tattoos and a pair of shades.

Big Woof.
Totally drive with him in the HOV lane.
Cool! Which one is you ?

Prometheus ecstatism
Looks like one of the Sasquatches out of The Big Lez Show
Looks just like my dog!  Her name is Poppins.  I'd share a pic if I could but I'm on mobile.

Carpool lane FTW!
But was the caption written by the human or the dog?
Which one is Ben?
What’s the dog’s name?
Bloody Hell.
Who wore it better
Chewy !!!!! When did you change your ride ?
The Dude, need a White Russian.
😂 funny
Which one is Ben?
Car pool lane!!!
Finally, decades later, I found the inspiration for "Come Together".
Hi Ben. Please tell us about your dog
Traffic? You could get away with using the carpool lane
You should drive a Jeep with the doors off.
"Hey Sassy, get in the fucken car. We're going to the water park.""... whatayatalkinabeet?"
Punch it Chewie!
Ben seems like a really chill dude, but when he opens his mouth to say something it's really deep and everyone will listen.
P
The Dude!
Honestly looks like Chewbacca if he was a biker... Or a family member on Duck Dynasty
But what’s the dog’s name?
And what's the dog's name?
I love Ben.
No fucking way. What animal is this?
Killer keemstar here let’s get roiiight into the news!
You're talking about the one in the hat right?
Peter Mayhew has had some costume tweeks.
Doesn't the Wookiee from Star Wars have a chest strap that looks like this dogs leash?
It's the dude reincarnated!
And PPPP
「Edward?」(Aww fuck it)
LpL
I also have a bearded, human-sized friend named Ben! Yours looks much more cuddly, though.
You look like the dude from dude perfect!
LTo
So is Ben the dog or the human????
Solo: A Star Wars Story (c. 2018 C.E. Colorized)
Looks like he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs
Cut the hair out of your friends eyes so he can see. No one wants to live half blind, cute as it might appear.
So worth 49k upvotes.
Omg in love with this very good boyHe is a gray golden doodle? How tho?
That's Chewbacca bro
What a handsome dog.
Fantastic beard.
This is a great photo!
i love this so much.
He can’t see
Cool. But what's the dog's name?
Sir—you and your shaggy dog make me smile!
My name is Ben and I have a beard, can I come too?
I wish my dog was that big so I could put him as a passenger and ride carpool
Put a bandolier on that dog right away! He will look just like Chewbacca and that will be awesome!
Luscious
Why is your dog wearing sunglasses
I wonder if you could use the carpool lanes in LA
Dude perfect
That dog looks like he would teach me how to grow weed.
Do you use the HOV lane?
Chewy! There you are r! Been looking all over for you!
Where they're going, they don't need roads 😎🤙
Is Ben on steroids?
Chewbarka?
Umm...I thought Chewie was from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
Yeah, it is funny to see a pup wear sunglasses.
I’m not sure who has the best beard.
Dayumn .. your very own diamond lane buddy
It took me a while to notice the dog. I thought Ben was the man and thought you got weird looks because he looks like a Walmart brand of keemstar
Ben is awesome!
Scooby's more lit cousin than Scrappy-Doo...   Totally-Doo
Who's the dog though?
Where'd you get him the sunglasses?
Ben needs the hair over his eyes cut so he can see.
[guttural wookie cry]
And what's the dog's name?
Excuse me I hope you tell him everyday that he is a G O O D B O Y E because he is glorious
“This is Ben. He has a beard. And he is human sized”, said the dog.
You’re wrong. Ben is Kylo Ren now
Dude- is this the first ever dog to post to Reddit?
But what about the dog?
a cross breed between wookie and bothan
When did Han Solo start lookin like a bitch?!

Please put matching sunglasses on him in the future.
Did you know that your dog is Tim Allen?
Han and the Wookie out on another adventure, **under cover!**

What glasses are those op? I had a pair of blue reflective and my kid lost them.
Hey wait ! Where is the seatbelt? :O
I'm so proud to be a Ben right now.
Which one is the Wookiee?
Unethical  life pro tip find human size dog with beard, Throw a hat & sunglasses on him & take the carpool lane without fearing a ticket.
You look just like your dog
Brothers from another mother.
The dog looks like the dude. The dude looks like Casey Affleck.
And here am I at age 25 and I can't grow a beard at all lol
is that Tim Allen Shaggy dog edition?
I've been looking at this pic for several minutes trying to figure out which beard looks better. I still couldn't say.
Cool! So what's the dogs name?
i feel like he can’t see well?
Omg I love Ben !!!! More pictures please ! Does Ben have an Instagram 😍

Chewbacca, i've been looking for you!!

Excellent beards fellas.  😎
Which one is the dog?

V cute but it is not comfortable for him to have all that hair in his eyes. You gotta trim the bangs
What’s the dogs name?
Plot twist. The dog is Mark.
I don't know why but I really, really like this photo.
Wookiee what we have hear
I think I know those guys. The Sullivan brothers. Homebrew aficionados from Nacogdoches, TX.
Hes fucking majestic. I love him already
I thought it was chewy at first
He is from Bendor.
Ben is blind asf
He looks big enough for you to legally go through the carpool lane with no one else but the two of you in the car.
😻
You need to give him bangs so he can see. He also needs a seat belt.
I needed the laugh today. That's really awesome .
This dog looks blazed as hell.
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.
The dog gets weird looks too sometimes
Carpool buddy that gives one access to fast lanes in California :).
Nice!!!
Bit u triied that be chewiy u liein
Traffic? Why not HOV? More attractive and convincing than a cutout.
Would look even better is Ben wore some sunglasses.
I think the hat probably throws people off.
That is a wookie.
Carpool lane here we come.
This post features some of my favorite things: big adorable, bearded males! 5/7 would pet both.
If Chewbacca and The Dude had a son.
What did you feed your beaver ?
Giant schnauzer?
Haha it might be Chewbacca's cousin
Keemstar?
More like he is a beard. You should get him some plaid and coconut beard oil so he can be a hipster.
What kind of doggo is this!?!?!
He looks like your Wookiee co-pilot.
Please tell me you both have dressed like ZZ Top for Halloween?! .... that would be..... perfection! ❤️
Woof!
How does he manage to see through those awesome bangs?
Type of dog? Type of dog?
He is a big fella
Are you sure that's not the guy from the old "Hollywood Squares"game show?
Neat. But what’s the dogs name?
Give him a pair of sunglasses
He could get away with driving in the hov lane
I see a manual transmission in your reflection 😍 may I ask what car?

OLD ENGLISH SHEEPDOG

Ben has some nice glasses!
He looks like “The Dude” from The Big Lebowski!!!  The Dog abides.
I want to have a dog like it,it must soft and i hug it must comfortable.
How can your dog see. Poor thing.
I’m reading this as if the dog made the post. also, reading it with a dog voice makes it more enjoyable.
Yea okay, but what's the dogs name?
Damn, Chewie and Keemstar!
plot twist- ben is the one on the right side of this picture.
I’m pretty sure your dog plays guitar for Mastodon
Are you talking about the dog or the guy?

Ben looks like Bigfooteven though ive never seen big foot.
Can you get into the HOV lane with him?
Did the human or the dog post this? Both at human sized, have a beard, and could be named Ben.
Punch it, Chewie!
Looks like Donnie the dealer from big lez show
I'd give the dog on the right dirty looks too. The guy on the left is all right.
Gotta get your copilot a Wookiee bandolier.

He looks like he played heavy metal in the 80s
This is going on r/hmmm , hope you don’t mind.

Chewbacca?!?!?!
Your dog is Gandalf
Hahahhaha... that’s hilarious
Pulled over for driving in the HOV (carpool) lane:"Honest, he's just a hitchhiker I picked up. He said he wanted a ride to the next big town where he could catch a bus. I can't understand why he's trying to act like a dog or something now."
r/humanlookingdogs
Ben needs a mohawk
i thought you were keemstar for a second
Chewy!
Looks like the [Miner 49er](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/scoobydoo/images/1/12/Scooby_meets_the_Miner_Forty-Niner.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/985?cb=20130926220434) from Scooby Doo
"Chewie, get us outta here!"
Poor Dog, he can’t see anything!!! Cut at least the hear from his eyes man!!!
Those glasses are sick
[Relevant?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0vsNFO2pDg)
Best way to be allowed to use the carpool lane 😍
Haha HOV labe all day! (High occupancy vehicle- Texas, like carpool lane elsewhere)
Ben looks like a gray haired Wookie.
Tell Ben to keep his eyes on the road!
Your dog looks like a stoner
Sounds like the dog wrote the caption about the driver
My grandfather would drive around with his Irish Setter, Heather, in his pickup. My grandmother would get calls saying he was driving around with some redhead.
wookie
This picture reinforces the theory that people look like their dogs lol
I love dogs like this lol
Wait is Ben the guy on the right?
Ben can't see shit.
so then what is the dogs name? :D
Legit thought he was a guy in a Chewbacca costume
gnarly brah
Chewie? Is that you?
So he owes you a life debt?
Woof
Ben is amazing.
What about the dog?
All my friends know the low rider...
He looks like he could be your stoner best friend
That's a Bigfoot
I didn’t know Keemstar had a dog.
Have a driving job, been wanting a wookie copilot forever.
So what is your name if your human-sized human driving the car is named Ben?
Chewy?? Is that you??
funny
Punch it chewie
How do we know this isn't the dog posting about his human friend Ben?
Wow!! How’d you get him to wear those sunglasses?
Chewbarka!!!
You can get in the HOV lanes!
Laugh it up, fuzzball!
That’s a pretty cool dog too
“Chewie, get us outta here!”
At least have the hair in front of his eyes trimmed by a dog groomer please.
Uhh... which one is the dog?
You should put sunglasses on him when he rides with you.
He needs a hat like yours...to keep his hair out of his eyes.  You are both handsome fellows!
Preparing the jump to hyperspace
You and your groomer are doing a great job with his coat. Absolutely love it.
Beard buddies for life!
Cut his bangs back so he can see better and get that good boi some shades!
A rare sighting of domesticated Chupacabra.
Ben looks like a cool dude.
It's like Jerry Garcia and Chewbacca had a baby
anthropopithecus？  first sight
Hi Ben, nice dog.
Ben is so lucky to have his own chauffeur
Dude, perfect
What's the dogs name?
Ruuuuuuur
This is just a pic of ZZ Top?/s
Put a hat and a sweater on him and you can drive in the HOV lane.
Can't tell if the human posted this, or the dog...
Hey, Ben. I am also Ben
No Chewy, I dont think Chevy had wookies in when they designed her...
"WAGRRRRWWGAHHHHWWWRRGGAWWWWWWRR." - Chewbacca
Didn't know dogs could write lol
Such a Tinder profile pic
Jeff Bridges has serious range
You should put a long sleeve collared shirt on him and see how long you can use the carpool lane.
Looks like the dog Ambrosius from the movie Labyrinth. Now you just need Sir Didymus sitting between you two.
Scruffy the Sasquatch? Is that you?
Sup keemetar
Is he a Briard?
Damn furries!
Coolest dog I've ever seen. Should be named IT
He looks like The Dude.
that dog is a dwarf wookie
He does look like a Ben! Great naming skills there..
Please cut his hair that is blocking his eyes. If you truly loved him you will get rid of that inconvience so he can truly see life for what it is. He does not have the ability to see through his hair as cool as it makes him look it his a terrible inconvenience.
lmao fake lumberjack, nice flannel shirt, kempt beard and backward hat.
Chewbencka.
With the way his hair covers his eyes he reminds me of Sam Sheepdog from Loony Toons.
He's "The Dude"! I mean just give him some shades too.
Soooo, which one of you is Ben?
Chewie, we're home.
This dog needs to be voiced by H Jon Benjamin.
What the hell! That's Chewbacca!!!
Remember Chewbacca? This is him now. Feel old yet?
poor thing can't see! give those long hair that cover his eyes a trim! Lovely creature you got!
I think I'm the only one who's oddly scared of this doggo.
Chewbacca???
Chewbacca
Omg!! I want him!!
Looks like Tony Beets in dog form
You’re shaycarl aren’t you
It looks like a wookie
Get that Wookiee a bowcaster and a bandolier.
At first, I thought that was Chewbacca.
Do you get passed for being in the carpool lane with him?
Which one is Ben ?
Do you get to use the commuter lane?
Han and chewy
chewbacca is that you?
My dog isn't human size, but she's got a wicked stache/eyebrow/goatee combo going.
Okay Ben, what’s your dogs name?
You need to dress Ben up as The Dude for Halloween. Basically just get the sweater  and some shades and you’re  done.
What's the dogs name?
I'm fat.  I have a beard.  I brushed my dog's hair over his eyes.  I have sunglasses that are blue.  I posed.
He's like Chewbacca'a third cousin twice removed.
What's the dog's name?
He need to shave lol...
Wow, you look a lot like Tyler from Dude Perfect!
I have never had a dog make me so uncomfortable before??? That being said, I love him.
Wait.  Which one is Ben?
I thought it was someone dressed up as Chewbacca at first glance lol
I love Ben. Does he have an ig? I want more pictures!
Looks like Chewbacca. Ever considered trimming the hair over his eyes? Makes me uncomfortable.
dope bro! looks like the real life chewbacca ..bawarrraaaaaaa
He looks like Chewbacca
“The dude abides.”
Can he pass for a person? I want to use him in the HOV lane.
OP what breed is your awesome dog?
Deadass thought it was a shitty Chewbacca cosplay
That’s not a dog, that’s a fucking Wookiee!
Ok but what's the one on the.lefts name?
ben is sexy AF in his own doggo way. I'd look twice
Sorry dude but he has a better beard than you do!
Ben seems cool but what is the dog's name?
Ben looks like he would be referred to as "The Dude" in some circles.
Pretty sure you could easily pass him off as Chewbacca
The one on the left looks funny too.

What breed of dog is that?

Everyone is calling “Ben” a wookie, but is nobody gonna mention OP on the left looks a bit like a dog?
He's the Chewy to your Han.
At first glance I was equally as fooled as those who give fun glances in traffic.  Not to mention his name is fucking Ben.
No shit, he's driving a car! What about that cool dog riding shotgun tho?
Chewbacca!!!
You have your very own Chewbacca!
I read, "He was a beard." And was trying to figure out how a dog can be a beard.

Why would a human sized Ben want to hang out with 4 foot tall ewoks? It doesn't make sense, therefore you must acquit.

Keemstar and Chewbacca (2018)
When your dog looks like an Ancient Greek philosopher.

You would get even funnier looks in a car where the steering wheel was on the other side.
Chewbacca!!
You guys look 2/3 of the way to a ZZTop album cover.
Your own wookie companion!
r/beards would love this!
Who's the guy in the passenger seat though?
Wizard of Dogs
You look like Tyler from Dude Perfect.

Just taking the Falcon out for a spin
Hey Ben!  What's your dog's name?

That's one way to get in the carpool lane...
Just a couple of beardbros, NBD
Wait, is Ben the guy on the left or right?
Sir I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car
‘I got a bad feeling about this’
I think you may have accidentally been sold a Wookie
Looks like that "Goodnight Ralph, Goodnight, Sam" sheepdog from Looney Tunes.
Whos the guy who has hair over his eyes then?
I like bens hat
Who is the guy on the left tho
Keemstar and Chewbacca?
It's scruffy! My mate from big lez show
Looks like Chewbacca from Star Wars!
Which ones Ben?
cut your dogs hair, man!! he's probably suffering under there, also probably restricting his vision.
If they ever need to cast a new Cousin Itt, I'm sure he'll get the part.
Tyler from DP, is that you?
He looks like a cross between Chewbacca and Gandalf.
For some reason I thought was Tom Segura
I'm pretty sure that's some guy in a fury costume
Who's Ben's girlfriend in the passenger seat?
Please don't ask OP how he managed to take the picture.
He is a Mog ofcourse.  Half man half dog, he's his own best friend.
Cool wookie
Punch it Chewie
Which one is Ben?
Punch it, Chewie!
Hi, Chewbacca!
blood of his blood :D
Is he wearing a seatbelt?
If Ben was in Ireland, he’d be driving.
Is Ben a real life Wookiee?
chewie we're home
Is Ben the one with glasses?
He looks filled with wise tales and crazy stories
Ben looks like a cool kid
And who is his friend on the left?
Give him a crossbow, and you're good to go
Thats a wookie
“You said it chewie”
Remind Ben seems to roll down the window and hang his head out the window, mouth wide open. You know, for more fun looks in traffic. 🤣🤣🤣
that's no dog, that's a wookie!
What’s the dogs name tough? 🤔
I bet he takes massive shits
Looks like The Dude
Ben needs a safety harness.
A real life Wilfred

Admit it; you broke into a wizard's house and kidnapped his dog.  You return Mouse to Mr. Dresden immediately!

Ed.....ward?
Who's who?
Excellent. That's a loving, caring owner!
Ok and who's the driver?
That’s not a dog. That’s a wookie.I bet you get some priceless reactions.
I came to the comments to see a photoshop of this with a bandoleer on ben. I just want you all to know i'm disappointed.
The Dude(dog) abides. He looks like Shaggy and Scoobys love child.
Give him a sunglasses and cowboy hat....He’ll look like ZZTop’s Mascot
And the other one is a dog.
The world stops when you’re in love
"You're the only one I know at this party!"
My dog hides her pigs ears under my pillow  I sometimes find them when I go to bed and stick my hand under my pillow.And when people come over and if I go up stairs for a minute she will collect her bones and toys and bring them upstairs to me to safe keeping. So i think she trusts me especially
Wow I love the contrast between her stillness and the doggy-chaos in the background. She loves you :)
"Oh thank god you're here. These other dogs are CRAZY. Can we *please* go home now?"
How on earth do you get any work done in this magical place? I would be so distracted :P
Those are some Pixar eyes if I’ve ever seen them lol.
“Yo, you still good with me going mental, right? Don’t need anything? Kisses? Boop my snoot? You’re good? Ok, cool.” **Back to spazzing out.**
*on mobile* Double clicks dogs face for ultimate zoom potential*fucking dies*
This is how I decided my dog was the one for me when he was a puppy. My mom let me choose a pup from a litter of probably a dozen pups. I found one I really liked because he kept sticking around me while all the other puppies ran around creating chaos or stuck to my sis/mom/the owners. We had to leave to go to the bank and get money once we decided. I told the lady specifically that I wanted "this one." and she promised she'd keep an eye on him since he had about 10 brothers/sisters that looked the same. We came back and all of the puppies were mixed in and she forgot to keep an eye on mine. As soon as we played with the puppies again all of the puppies began running around except one. One puppy stayed with me the moment we got to see the litter again. That's the very  pup I knew I was looking for. The rest is history!He's turning 20 this year and still going strong! Edit: here's a pic of him! https://imgur.com/a/hreMz
That one gorgeous lady. She make any new friends? Breed please?
Beautiful good girl! She looks a lot like my Link, is she a shepherd/border collie mix? Give this good girl a treat for me!
Oh she is perfection
Dogs are AWESOME!

What a sweet face!
Wow what a beautiful girle. Look at all the love in those eyes
“So this is what you do when you leave me every day??”
Aww, that’s so sweet!!
Aaaaw she loves you!
I want to work with these dogs. :)
Where do you work? Are they hiring?
She's beautiful! What's her name?
The epitome of puppy dog eyes. Love it, so adorable.
My heart just exploded and that's not even my dog. All the awwwwwws.

"I don't care that I'm here. You're here."
I would love to see a photo like this of a bring your cat to work day. It would be quite different.
She's such a good boy
Treasure that look of love. I just lost my boye last week and I just came to say, treasure it beyond all measure. Treasure the treasuring. She’s beautiful and you can see the adoration in her eyes.
L is for the way you look at me.
Reminds me of a girl heh
And not a stitch of work was done that day, I hope.
My dog doesn't even look at me in public. He deosn't quite understand "stranger danger".
Treasure the time you have with such a good pal.
That faceeeeeee :D
Had a cousin with a sheep herding dog, and when my parents would bring me and my twin brother to their house if one of us crawled out of the room the dog would pick us up by the shirt and gently return us to our parents. Like "scuse me this belongs to you"
That’s the “are you ready to go home”? Look
This is such a sweet picture. ❤️ I love bringing my dog to work for half days. She’ll let other people pet her for a few seconds and then run back to me or lay at my feet under my desk, always reminding me that I’m her favorite. 😏
My cat makes me feel the same way, except instead of showing me love she just begs me for food.
I aww’ed out loud.
Are there treats? Someone said there would be treats...
What a sweet face!
Those eyes!
My heart! 😭
What a good girl!
They like me better.
Relationship goals.
WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THAT?? We found our dog as a puppy, abandoned on the side of a road in Monument Valley, Utah. We thought maybe she is German Shepherd and Australian Shepherd mix, but yours look IDENTICAL. This is exciting. I'll take my answer off the air.
So cute!
I love her "eyebrow dots" !
Is that a standard poodle on the right of her?
Your dog is beautiful! What breed is she?
Sir you stole my dog.
I want a dog so bad :(((
Looks like my pretty little lady! http://imgur.com/iNHPMCD
This is very nice
She is a part of your world. You are the whole world to her.Thinking this always makes me sad :(
Awww, she got an adorable face! <3
Or perhaps you're just holding some treats
As long as you don't work for United...
That’s the most “I love you” eyes I ever see
“Doggo” is going to be the reason that I unsubscribe from this subreddit.
Find someone who looks at you the way this dog looks at OP.
Anybody know what kind of dog this is. Because I have a rescue that looks exactly like her.
Oh. Dear. God! That is absolutely heart warming and breaking at the same time. What a stunningly beautiful photo of her love for you!
That’s it. I’m getting a dog and treating it with the best love and care in the world.
I have a beagle I’ve had since he was a puppy and he loves me, but the lab I adopted as an adult LOVES me. He looks at me like this. Like I’m the whole world. It’s so sweet.
“Dave, seriously, take me home.” - Dog
Thank you OP. She is so pretty, that I want to keep her as my wallpaper.
Poor janitor.  Going to be a feces festival tonight.
Adorable
That's a face that just says "worry" lol
Haha, dogs sure do love humans!
My dog loves everybody, especially new people.  Because of this he kind of likes me the least out of everybody on earth but it sounds worse than it is.
More like favorite anything. You > Food > Butts.
That is just the SWEETEST face! AWWWWW
When we got our dog an Aussie named Dub, I became second fiddle in this house. The adoration that boy has for my husband is awe inspiring.
Is she a Border Collie German Shephard mix?
Generally, if I do not do what I want to do....I might get a treat!
I thought she was wearing a tie
"like wow there's so many other doggos here and this is so fun, are you sure this is okay pack leader?"
Oh the lemon bassett hound made my day!
Shes so cute, that look is pure love.
animals are good companions to relax the environment
I love this so much.  She has love in her eyes.
I love her beautiful face! Bless your baby!
Who's a good girl? You are!
Good doggo!
I wonder if when you leave, she thinks you're just going to play with dogs and people.
IS THAT A BASSET HOUND????!?!
That’s adorable.
Posts like this make me want a dog so bad.
Aw, she looks exactly like the Aussie I had as a kid. rip Bob, you were a good girl
awesome
AWWWWWWWW.  Dats cute is heck.
favorite everything
Both of you are so blessed to have eachother  :-)
I could not have a dog this cute. I would never get anything done, I would just give pets and belly rubs until I got evicted.
Oh man, [she looks just my dog!](https://imgur.com/gallery/YyNwQ)Parker's half border collie, half lab.
Aww she’s lovely!
wow what race/races is this dog??? mine looks exactly the same its a australian sheperd/ rot , never saw one like it before
I see a beagle bum!!
That is love. 💕
Find someone who looks at you like this dog is looking at her human
noice
So nice!
Dog day camp attendant here. My girl is the same way. Even when she gets to see all of her favorite friends, she still checks in with me every other minute. Ugh, I love her so much.
That looks like a big fat thanks to me!
And here I am in love with the basset.
A happy story:"...my fave hooman was there, and it was the most dog butts I ever sniffed, the end.  Best day ever."
Wholesome
Please tell me you gave her a good belly rub after this picture was taken
There's a study that says dogs prefer the company of humans, even dogs who were raised by other dogs.OTOH, wolves prefer the company of wolves, even wolves who were raised by humans.
So wholesome
She’s beautiful! What’s the breed mix? Man, she’s wonderful!
This makes my heart happy!
I wish my dog liked his own kind.
How cute <3 even my dog makes me feel same.. kuddos!
My cat always sucks my ears when I go to bed
Oh my goddddd..... The feeeeelsssss of this post
“Hi, I love you.”
Today this sub truly has lived up to it’s name!
😭😭😭
That is one happy doggo right there.
Thank you for cheering me up OP.  This made me tear up badly.
Spent ~10 years doing dog daycare, my dog joined me the first few years but eventually got banned from play group for trying to "help" me too much
That is beautiful!!!  My girl does the same thing; She may have other dogs around, or a few people, but she is always focused on me.  That, of course, is true love in one of its most treasured forms.  Thank you for sharing that awesome pic!
A VP at work would bring her dogs to work all the time.  Nobody else was allowed.  Her dogs pissed and shit all over the place.  She was not the one who had to clean it up, of course.
Any time there is another living creature around my dog forgets I exist until it's gone.
Like she's surrounded by a sea of chaos, but she is perfectly tranquil just staring at you.
I took my boy to the dog park for the first time Sunday. I was hoping he would tire himself out with the other dogs. It was cold so my SO and I walked the fence line to keep warm and all he did was follow us.
Now my dogs go and try to get themselves readopted. If I take them to a dog park I have to physically remove them from their new family.
What kind of doggie? Mine was similar loooved her sich a sweetie like yours toohttps://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7jawrq/my_beautiful_15_yr_old_shepherd_mutt/
We don’t deserve these mother fuckers
The Bassett on the left is looking for snacks
"You're the only one I know at this party!"
That's the "I love you" look. Similar to what my dog does when I walk him
Oh I need one of those! Just that look ofLove on its face! Awwww!
“I LOVE IT HERE, AND YOU”
Whoa that looks exactly like my dog. Do you know what breed it is? I got mine at a shelter and they weren't completely sure
this looks like my dogs "i'm stressed please take me home" face
Plot Twist: She was eating Lunch.
This one literally brought me to tears. I had to return the dog I just adopted because it kept biting me, including in the face that got infected and I need to take antibiotics for. I see this and I weep knowing there are good dogs out there but am sad that I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never find one for me.You hug that dog and make sure it knows it is a good dog.
Or that she still needs to go potty.
This says it all about dogs. Better and much more dependable than people. They don't judge and just love you, period.
We don't deserve these creatures.
Just stopped crying over over my little buddy passing, opened Reddit, aaaaand fuck I need to get another furry friend. Life's so empty without em
I have a beagle I’ve had since he was a puppy and he loves me, but the lab I adopted as an adult LOVES me. He looks at me like this. Like I’m the whole world. It’s so sweet.
This is precious. It's like your each other's calm, in a world full of chaos.
We have a dog at work that is like this with her handler. She loves everyone and everything, but the complete and utter devotion she has for this guy is something to see.  If he leaves the area for even a moment and she can't follow, when he comes back she is just deliriously, knock people across the room her butt and tail are wagging so hard in joy happy that it kind of pangs my heart to see.
That is awesome
We don’t deserve dogs!
I had a 95 lb lab mix that we adopted from the Humane Society that followed me so close his nose was always bumping on my butt. I had to be careful not to trip over him in the kitchen.  And I never had any privacy when I went to the bathroom.  He passed away a couple of months ago in January. I miss him so much.
That is a beautiful dog, can't wait til I move into a bigger house to have my own.
Everybody’s watching her, but she’s looking at yoouuu

"Ummmm, hey there... So, like, my bowl is empty, just thought you should know. "
Haha you should frame this.
“Just found out you have a cat.  I will need you to pay the monthly pet charge fromnow on.”
The cat is probably like “Excuse me human, who are you and why are you in my sink”
My cat is a feeler. He loves to put his paw on people's body/head/arm whatever. When we had someone in fixing our electricity, he would just sit on the counter beside the man working with his paw on his head. The man just kept working.
Looks like a space shuttle. This could be good for /r/PhotoshopBattles
You have to keep an eye on the workers
I hope he is putting in an iron line for the drain. You know, a new Fe line.

There is almost nothing our cat loves more than handyfolks/repairfolks.  he helps, observes, checks them out, helps some more...
I once got my bathroom redone and the contractor doing the work nicknamed my cat "the inspector".
Hes got someone to hand him tools
The last image he saw before losing his hand to the disposal the cat turned on.

I always wondered what lived down the drippy drink hole 🕳
this is an amazing picture. i fucking love cats.
I hope you don't mind, I'm going to knock this screwdriver down this hole.Actually, that's not true. I don't care at all whether you mind.
Poor cat thought it was a humongous mole rat.
What a cool landlord. Mine is dumb as hell. He just replaced our 2 broken wall unit ACs with window units. They keep shutting off/not cooling and showing an error message, but he says it's because we have one of the bedroom doors closed. ? Also wants me to just leave them running because "they'll turn on eventually". Sigh.
Can confirm, I work under sinks ALOT and more often then not the tenants cat lays on my chest and watches me work or gets in the sink or sharpens it’s claws on my tool bag.
thats a weird ass angle for a hand
It takes one expert to solve the problem and two to take picture of other.
Hey bud, everything ok down there ?
The last thing you ever see.....
"Here's a list of the top 10 photos taken, before tragedy struck".
Should get this enlarged and put on your bedroom ceiling. That way, you can freak out anyone that you manage to ba-doink in the future
I remember once how when i lived at my first apartment, 18 years old immediately out of high school, and i didn't have many friends so i bought a cat. And he was the biggest asshole ever. One day i locked myself out of the apartment and i had this little table right next to my door and the peephole on the door allowed me to vaguely see the eye behind it. I could make out the green little slit of that fuckers eye watching me suffer outside. Kind of like this lol.
A landlord that fixes things congrats
"We don't own a cat!"
That episode of Hannibal when he looks down on the killer from the roof. Especially Will's vision version with Hannibal being that demon-deer. Can't find a pic.
What's it like having a landlord that knows compassion?
Thats a total "who is you" look lol
“It rubs the lotion on its skin”
Your landlord is a cat?
'What are you doing to my parents' sink? And are you going to feed me? And why are you here when they aren't? And are you going to feed me?' Cat, probably.
Fake. Everyone knows landlords don't help you fix anything.
This by far has to be the most, funny, true to life adorable frikkkin picture I've ever seen lol... Coming from a crazy cat lady 😜
You have a VERY cool landlord....this is a good relationship,,,
would you like some chips, soda?
Our cats would make great friends (my cat is the toilet cat)
Reminds me a bit of the James Bond intro from the thumbnail.*Felicense to Kill*.  *On Her Meowjesty's Secret Service*.  *A Mew to a Kill*...
So stinkin’ cute!
In Ontario, you can't refuse to rent to someone who has a pet.
RIP OP’s landlord. That’s the face of a killer getting ready to attack.
Cleaning up the bloody mess your cat left after that must've been hell
Please frame this. Classic.
Landlord: “Ah yes, I see the problem. You have a human stuck in the drain.”
“Hello there!”
What a great landlord 😂
"Hey. What ya doing down there?"
“We ALL float up here!”
GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM(CAT)...
Let's hope this cat hasn't seen gifs of other cats turning on faucets or else OP's landlord is gonna have a bad time
"So, I'll be adding the pet deposit on to next month's rent."
Now you're in the sinken place!
Cat: "So you're the one making all those loud noises when they flip the switch."
A new meme is born!"Human, I'd like to ask you a few questions'
Your landlord is awesome!
Something tells me thats the last moment of his life.
Best cat picture ever posted!
Secretly that cat is wishing there was a garbage disposal nearby.
Long live the king
“What is this slave doing down here?”
Seems like you have a pleasant landlord.
You’ll replace your eyeball if that cat sinks its paw down dat hol.
"before you die you see the ring"
The supervisor is clearly making sure that the minion is working hard enough.
Dang, too bad the cat is out of focus.

Wow everyone talking about deposits and pet charges. I got lucky, it’s fifty dollars extra for my and my gfs three dogs. And that’s not each, that’s a flat rate.
"I have caught you in my trap dumb hooman. "
Ah, I found your problem. THERE'S A FUCKING CAT IN YOUR SINK.
As it was stated in this type box "what are your thoughts?"
Really that's cool, my landlord served me an eviction notice.
"Tonight, you"
Haha looks like my sisters cat. Also always an up vote for a victim!
Who else heard James Bond theme
Goodbye Mr. Bond.
Good to see the supervisor is making sure everything is correct.
The last thing you see before the young Khajiit fulfills his first Dark Brotherhood contract
Hopefully it's a pet friendly rental. lol
this view from the space station proves once and for all that the earth is definitely cat.
And this is how you discovered the cat was using the sink as a litter box
Cat foreman, on the job!
"Human, do you need assistance?"
Plumbing cat is watching you renovate.
"why is the hooman down the water hole?"
The money Skylar. .....WHERE IS IT?
WAT DOING?
"Put the fucking lotion in the basket!!"
At least he isn't showing Satan's starfish as he prepares to put that hole to use.
we all float down here
There is some real seriousness in his look
My landlord doesn’t understand english and makes me jump hoops to replace my lightbulbs.
*turns on disposal*
I always hate it when people watch me work.
This is not what you were hired for Hooman. Basic to training with you
"Excuse me. Please return the mouse I put down there last night. K thanks!"
I bet he's glad it's not the other end of the cat instead
It looks like the cat is looking out the window of a space station.
This is some Wes Anderson shit.
Removes one trap and finds himself staring into another.
It's almost as if the cat's saying:*"My mom said you would be replacing the sink, but if it's just the garbage disposal, you should be outta here in like 20 minutes, yeah?"*
"Look I don't know who the fuck you are but i'm hungry and you're capable of feeding me."
I wish my landlord was a cat
/r/catsinsinks
"You're not my regular servant."
Now, THAT is a supervisor!
“You can’t fool me, hooman. I know what you’re doing and I do NOT approve.”
Just the supervisor making sure he wasn't asleep on the job.
Must be nice having a landlord that allows cats.
What you don’t see is our cat in question, Captain Kibbles, casually pushing the pot of boiling spaghetti water into the sink.

You've got a cool landlord.
All night, every post I click. it's that cat looking at me
It puts the lotion on its skin
My landlord got in a fight with her husband in our house and broke a lamp.
She's checking to make sure the staff are maintaining her kingdom in accordance with her tastes.
*I see you have found the way down the gutter where you belong human*
"Well... There's your problem. You have another human under your sink! That can't be good..."
I thought he was in space...
They replaced your sink with a cat?!?
"It rubs the lotion on it's skinOr else it gets the hose again."
as the paw moves to the garbage disposal switch...... finds that it's off.... slowly pulls out of frame.....
And you thought, "Hey, Im just going to steal the landlord's karma."
Its like a poster for some dystopian movie where people are enslaved and penned by their cat overlords. Just needs some more grit.
“I can see hoomans now the drain is gone”
Whatcha dooooin
Can someone photoshop this already with the opening scene from James Bond?
I like your landlord.
Since I have you down there, let me talk to you about this pet policy
excuse me, wtf are you doing?
We aren’t allowed under the sink, guy. Get out before mom sees you!
"Oh hey there! Need help? On sec, let me just turn on the water for ya....yeah there ya go."
"Whatya doing in there human? Repairing my automated waterfall?"
... Soon.
“… ‘sup.”
As a European this "our landlord fixes stuff in our apartment while we're not home" concept seems so foreign.I'd never let some guy I hardly know into my apartment without me being there.And the apartments are usually rented empty so whatever sink is in there is mine and my responsibility.And the cat definitely looks like it has the same thoughts going through its head at that moment.
Ground control to major Tomcat.
Dogs are better than cats.
Why dont you frame it on ceiling or something? ;D
“You’re not the feeder?”
You're best friend in the whole world !
Well...you're screwed.  You're going to have to pay your pet deposit now.

My landlord only sends me text responses about how the cockroaches I'm finding apparently aren't an issue.
It looks like a candid shot from inside Richard Gere’s asshole.

The trick is finding a landlord who needs a cat inside for the right reasons......No pet rent and no mice for the two  years I’ve lived here.
He was making sure they were doing their job right lol.
Your landlord is a cat?
That's where he put the first camera.

Who needs a sink when you have a cat?
When I lived with my ex and he was getting a gas line installed for a new gas fireplace, my cat would watch the plumber intently and even sat in his faux fleece lined hoodie. It was kind of cute.

Today my son pretended that the cat scratched him to see it get in trouble.
[Their relationship in one picture](https://imgur.com/a/VbVqcOS)  She's not even mad here. That's just her face. I got her from the pound when she was a few years old. I have had her 11 years and through a million moved and boyfriends and now she gets to be with me as I live a sedate life as a mom/wife. Don't overlook adult cats! She is the best impulse buy of my life. Photos are mine taken by @caseyraephoto on insta
I've said it before on reddit.Cats don't just want to go outside. They want to go outside WITH YOU. They want to explore with you and play in the grass with you and nap in the sun with you. When I figured that out I started taking a blanket into the front yard and my cat and I would lay out there while I played with my laptop and he scratched at the trees.Looks like Op's son has figured that out.

My boy was a rescue cat. I think he tolerated me because he trusted me, but wasn’t ever really affectionate. That was until my little girl was born; he had finally found his human. He was 8kgs of part feral beast, unfriendly to almost everyone, and barely tolerating those of us he liked, but his girl; he adored. I would often find her sitting on him and “reading”. She would pull his whiskers and when she released them, he would bunt her from head to tail, miaow as if to say “are you coming?” and wait for her to crawl after him. He slept under her bed, cot, and next to her capsule. He would wait by the door when we left and miaow at me until he could smell her when we came home, making sure she was safe. He adored her. Rescue cats are the best.
Reminds me of my son and my cat, Hoover.  My son is always chasing him around and trying to pet him, sometimes a little too rough.  Hoover tolerates it most of the time.
I don’t get how your cat doesn’t run away. My cat got out and was missing for a week. How do I train cats to stay by me or be able to be indoor or outdoor?
This kind of blew up! I own the rights to the photo but credit must be given to our family photographer. She gets the most beautiful pics of my kid and pets. @caseyraephoto on instagram
My parents had a cat named CJ when I was born. This cat loved me and I loved the cat. My grandmother said that when she came to help my mom after they came home from the hospital with me, CJ didn't leave her alone with me if my mom was out of the room. CJ just sat directly in front of my grandmother and starred her down.When I was able to sleep with CJ and not risk suffocation, my parents say she allowed me to treat her like a stuffed animal.The story of CJ is one of a truck stop box kitten. Somewhere on the side of a California highway, my dad heard her call.
I’ve heard Calicos are sweet. I thought it was a saying, but each calico I have met is loving and affectionate.
You printed and framed that, right? Right?
This picture is taken by a professional photographer . Really good picture. The cat, the boy, the lake/river. Truly amazing
She has a “tortitude”. We have a fat tortie as well, and she ONLY loves my 9yo son, she will kill anyone else with a look, but runs to his bed and waits for him and even will bath his head, blech The tortitude in tortishell cats is truth.
It seems like they are two old souls who haven’t seen each other in some time.Beautiful.
Well I must share about my Ollie.  He was born March 23rd of this year.  I got him from the Human Society.  He was fostered from his 2nd day of birth.  Neutered.So.  He has this thing he does.  He burrows his head into my neck and just stays there.  Purrs and drools.  Yes that's right: drools *like a river* drools.  During the whole time I am talking sweet to him...very softly.  This lasts about 5 minutes and afterwards?  My whole shirt is soaked.  At his 1st year appt w/Vet?  I asked her about it thinking something was wrong.  She got this softest look in her face and said "he just really, really loves you" and I know it.  When I cut his nails?  He stays still and if I look down at him?  He is looking deep into my eyes w/this look of trust that's unnerved me.  I love Ollie.  Sadly, he won't sleep w/me at night.  I used to yell at him "I'm going to get a dog Ollie that will sleep w/me" or "Okay, we're getting another cat".  Not even threats worked, lol.  So I ran into a friend who's foster cat (6mos) was terrorizing her two very small dogs.  As she described it: my little dogs used to walk around w/their tails waging and happy and after the kitten started wanting to play...they walked around w/their tails down and fearful every minute.  I felt so bad and I thought Ollie and I could use another.........So now I also have Mr. Baby.  He was taken from a hoarder (62 cats) and was so covered w/fleas they couldn't tell he was a Ginger.  He and Ollie and best of buds. Sadly?  Mr. Baby doesn't like sleeping w/me either, lmao.  Oh well.  I've adjusted.  hahahahaThanks for letting me share.
My cat, Snuggles, was my best friend in the whole world. She stumbled into my life when I was 2 years old and she was a tiny abandoned kitten from a factory. She had made it all the way across the main road just to find us.We had the best adventures! We would go to space in Rockets out of cardboard boxes, Report the news on tv’s out of cardboard boxes, we made our own dens and went camping in the front room, we would sit outside in the rain under a huge umbrella on top of the coal bunker thinking about our next adventure together. She was the best cat in the world. Your little boy is going to have the most wonderful memories of his lovely friend.
Good boy.  Good girl.
They remind me of Calvin and Hobbs.
This is the kind of picture that goes on your mantle for life.
This is the sweetest picture ever!
Sorta reminds me of Grawp from Harry Potter. Imagine having this thing around that's twice your size and very clumsy, but you know it's full of love and doesn't mean you any harm.

Calvin and Hobbes
This pic reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes :)
This is some Calvin and Hobbes shit right here
I love this so much.I have a tortilla (<---oh, I'm definitely leaving that AC. I meant tortie!) and she is verrrrrrry anti-social. A lot of my friends didn't even know I had her because she would always hide and only be cuddly with me when we were alone. (rescue kitty. must have had some issues when teeny tiny. ☹️)When she was 4 years old, I met someone and when she came over to my place, I warned her that one of my cats would hide and it had nothing to do with her. Well, what a surprise. The minute she saw her, she climbed on her lap and put her cute little paws around her neck and got really cozy. I couldn't believe it.Fast forward. It's now 10 years later and that someone is now my wife and her and my tortie have been the bestest of buds since. I have loads of pics over the years like [this](http://imgur.com/a/kXZNeiW) from my wife. 😺Seeing your 2 babies like this makes me so dang happy. Also, high five to adopting an adult kitty. I wish more people would.
Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.
Damn, that’s adorable.
I got 2 kittens the week I got my PTSD grandkids to raise. Those cats trained the kids by scratching when needed and now the cats get hauled all over the place just like the OP's cat. They are both sleeping with one that has a pretty high fever now. They are best buds in a way they'll never be with me.
IRL Calvin and Hobbes?
That shit better be in a picture frame on the wall!!!
I dont normally get choked up. When I do its because I am reminded that I cant see my best friend. When I was a small boy I had a tortishell cat as well. We were pretty inseperable. Playing mario? right there on my shoulder. Homework? Right there on the desk. Always stayed at the foot of the bed. Would meow when I got up. One of those rare intelligent cats that would walk outside or stay with you no matter what. Would hiss if you tried leaving without saying goodbye. She put up with a lot of shit too. Unlike your son I have no pictures. especially ones like this. I would trade everything I have and more, not a single sacrifice I wouldnt make if I could spend just one more day with my friend. I dont normally care for photos but really like this one and if your son even feels half of what I did by the time I was 11 (my cat was old by then so we all know what happens) then he will really, realy appreciate you took this for him. To each their own but I wouldnt show this to him until later in life though. Safe from the teenage angst and all that.
I didn't expect much love from my cat to my son. She was always just irritated that my belly kept kicking at her when she laid there. We came home from the hospital with him, and she was intrigued. She always checked him out. Eventually he started to try crawling and eventually she started getting right in front of him and wiggling her tail. Like she was playing with him. She got him to follow her around so much.And now they're damn near best friends. He makes her little cardboard box condos and sneaks her food. She doesn't have to add to the friendship. He's happy his cat loves him.
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen in a while, and it has given me the warm fuzzies 😍

Reminds me of my childhood cat. She was so patient with me it was like having a third parent around. It’s good to see others sharing the same bond!
Anything the light touches is yours! What about that place ?That is the vacuum cleaner  closet, you should never go there !
How adorable! Little ones and cats are two of the cutest things in my book, and I LOVE cats and babies together!! Reminds me of my dear cat who I picked from the shelter at age 3. She remained with us for 10 years before dying from some sort of stomach issues. I miss her every day :( Nothing like the bond between a child and cat!
I recently had to have my cat put down because he got hit by a car, might sound crazy but he was the only thing keeping me sane when I first got him, wasn’t in a great place, bought him back home with me to live with the whole family and he’s been so loved by all of us, this picture Just brings back so many happy memories ❤️Thanks for sharing 😌
She a tortie, of course she's tolerant and loving.
Humans do not choose their cats...Cats choose their humans.BASTET BE PRAISED!
Why do my cats suck? They hate my kids and hit them as they walk by. I wish my cats and kids had this kind of relationship.
So adorable! ❤️
This is adorable
This is the purest thing in the world
Some animals just know. It’s a wonderful thing
You are a great photographer
My dad's cat adopted me when I was born, would always climb into bed with me at night to keep watch.
This is adorable on a level that I am not sure if I know how to express....now I must go find one of my cats and hug it till it hates me
Amazing picture. He’ll love this when he’s older
I think some cats recognize the difference between children and adults. My cat has put up with all kinds of bullshit from me when I was little, 3 kittens, and a puppy. He always uses a softer touch when dealing with babies.
Our tortie passed last year. This picture made me smile thinking of our beloved little kitty. She would have loved our baby.
Your son has loved \*his\* cat. Not your cat anymore bud, sorry.
One time when I was in highschool I was waiting just outside the school and a kitty cat from one of the nearby suburbs came over to me and sat next to me at the curb while I waited for my bus to go home. I was on an I.E.P. and I got out earlier than everyone else. For a few more days after that, the same kitty sat next to me in the same spot while I sat at the curb of the sidewalk. One time when the bus came, the kitty wanted to get on the bus with me. I felt horrible, the kitty gave me the sad kitten eyes.
This picture genuinely makes me emotional and I have no clue why 😭
Anyone else get a total "Calvin and Hobbes" vibe here? Love it!
Please enlarge and frame this picture and hang it up in your house. It's so precious 😭❤️
Any chance your son's name is Calvin and your cat's name is Hobbes? :)Thank you for sharing this beautiful photo!
Excellent picture. You should blow it up and get it framed.
I rescued a stray cat, super cute, beautiful blue eyes. She walks around out house but wont get near us, she starts complaining as soon as we get a few feet away. Recently, a couple with two girls moved in the house next to mine. My cat wont stop following them around and taking care of them when they are outside playing. She lets them grab her and rub her belly. Im pretty sure cars know they are children and are super gentle to them. I love cats, so damn much. They are perfect little creatures.
Man, this was me and my cat growing up. She was a barn cat, wild as all get out. But she'd just sit and chill with me. Even into my pre-teens. RIP Evinrude. Named her after the brand of outboard motors cause her purr was so loud. Thanks for bringing back some good memories, OP.
I love this picture a lot.
"Tolerates that love"OP knows cats
When treated gently, kitties treat our young as if it’s their own. They love and snuggle, spend time, and stand guard during illness; and teach their owners about the limits of power.Cats really are a wonderful.
Look at the scenery together
I had a similar cat when I was born. She could stare people down from sitting in her chair, but treated me like the most important thing in the house. The first time I was allowed to get up and make my own cereal bowl, she ran back and forth from me to my parents meowing at them until she was told I was allowed.She treated me like her little brother.
That's not tolerance. The cat loves him, too.
Wow. I left my cat with my parents when I moved in with my allergic husband. The first time I brought my baby over the cat took one look and disappeared. I basically never saw him again (he was fine to be clear, just hiding from the scary baby).
This picture does things to me
...Yep, and now I'm totally regretting not having a son and not having a cat right now, don't mind me, I'm just muddling my way through the front pages here, excuse me...
I haven't seen my cat in 4 months and I fly home from Uni in a week and this post has made me so excited to see her.
This is the perfect photo. It reminds me so much of my best friend of over 20 years.
r/eyebleach
This will be a stock image soon
right in the feels
Can we have more pictures of this?
''there's probably fish in there''*What's Fish?*''Delicious! You must try one''
Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.
This picture is heart warming! We had cats all my life (i'm 21) and I couldn't imagine my life without cats. They can be so loving and cuddly. Don't get me wrong.. Sometimes cats can be little brats but they still show a lot of love.
I used to have this kind of relationship with my first cat. She used to climb up on my shoulders or follow me around and we would talk to each other. I was so sad when she got older and was starting to go, she was so strong. At the age of 18 she passed away while I was stationed in South Korea. When I’m having a rough day I sometimes can see her in the corner of my vision.
This is a real life Calvin and Hobbes. You need to start a comic based on this taking photos of the two and photo shopping in dialog bubbles
I have a young son and we had an old orange tabby girl named Jaffe who just really took to him.  Even as she got very old and sick, she'd perk up when he'd come around and they'd play for hours with this little glitter wand with tinsel at the end.Every night, before bed, he'd get his "Jaffe snuggles".  We all miss her very much.Thanks for posting this.
Son: Gee, Cat, what do you want to do tonight?Cat: The same thing we do every night, kid - try to take over the world!
This comment will probably get buried but any chance you could like to a full size image somewhere? I'd love to set this as my desktop background :)
Kitty Cat is son’s Co-Momma❤️
This is the post that made me get a cat for my youngest for Christmas. Just FYI.
Probably the only time I will upvote anything involving a child on r/awwExcellent pic
Great picture
Really cool picture!
Awesome pic!
This photo us perfection
Awww so cute
I love love love this. Torties rule. Beautiful pic
I adore inter-species friendship and love. It just gets my sweet spot! Thanks for sharing ;)
Oh I love this. So sweet
Fucking aww!
Sitting by the water, contemplating life. Sweet! They are adorable.
My little girl cat is really gentle with my niece. The other cat flees like she just robbed a bank. When she was a few days old she slept beside her baby carrier singing a song of her people.
Awww that’s so cute!
That’s a beautiful shot. And story.
She's just playing the long con to make sure your son is another future cat slave.
This is beyond precious.
Looks like my former cat “taco” rip taco, your tail was ripped off while sleeping in my moms car when she started it. you made it 10 years while in the process of fighting off other cats that came onto our property. bro disappeared one day and even at that young age i knew what happened. rip bro. haven’t owned a cat since
Why do my cats suck? They hate my kids and hit them as they walk by. I wish my cats and kids had this kind of relationship.
thats sweet, i had a big white Tom cat i wagged around when i was that age, im sure to tolerated me out of love too
You're going to like this picture, I guarantee it
Sweetest photo ever.
This is so sweet. Reminds me of me and my own cat.
So cute.
That's a beautiful shot. Thank you for sharing this little bit of joy
This is probably the cutest picture I’ve ever seen on the internet.
This is such a great photo. One to frame on the wall for sure!
a vy warm and sweet photo :)
Pets are wonderful
Such a great picture. I wish them both many happy days together.
Wow.. this is one of my fav pic ever. Two conscious beings experiencing life in its simplest form.
This picture is awesome, they both are enjoying the view of the lake. I wonder what those two are talking about?
Good god I think I just grew an ovary.  I love this photo so much.
We had a cat when I was growing up that would let you poke it. “Cuddle it” and generally mess with it until you were about 5. Then it decided you were smart enough to know better and would hiss or swat to  stop you.
My favorite cats I’ve had growing up were a calico and a tortoise shell. I’ve had a couple tabbies and a siamese, but they were never as loving and personable as my calico and torti were.
"For some chicken, I'll eat your homework"
Lovely picture
A beautiful picture!
This is the best picture ive seen this year.
This is called true love....selfless and unconditional😍😍😍😘😘😘
I'm thinking about having this printed and framed.  Love this picture
The picture of any companionship. Tolerance, love, forgiveness.
They are very cute together and it melts my heart.
I got my cat at 14 and I’m 23 now. He is amazing.
This is a great picture. ❤️
This is special.
This image genuinely makes my whole day
that picture is simply awesome. what a freaking great shot and subject matter!
...and this, young lad, is where you should fish.  Back in my day, we would fish with our paws, but I hear you humans have something called a fishing pole.
God I love this picture so much
My family has had the same line of cats for 22 years. They started from a stray barn cat from my uncle and soon enough we had a heard of pure white fluff balsa every couple years. Each time some would get lost or die a new litter cam from the cat literally called mama. She died when I was 7. I had her last done a big hulk of a cat who yelled constantly and could bruise my young body. He eventually went missing when I was 11. We thought that was it for the white cats, then our neighbor told us a stray cat took his garage from him. She had 3 tiny little white kittens with her. The two that survived became the two cats I have today. They are more loyal and loving then most dogs and have been a major part of my life. Once their gone that will be it and I'm not ready for that.
Both my mind and my heart calm down at the first look
She found her human. Love this so much
Must be bubbles when he was kid
You’ve got to blow this photo up and hang it with a nice frame!
This is perfect.
Please make a large print of this and hang it in your home.  This photo really deserves it.
“Everything the light touches.”“Everything?!”“Everything.”
This made me smile today. Thank you.
wtf is that title lol. holy shit people on this site are weird
(✿´‿`)
'In that pond my little human pal, there are a lot of fish. Now go and get your Mom and Dad and tell them you want to go fishing. I will share the fish with you'
This needs to be a meme. Caption should be "just look at those assholes".The kid and the cat saying it. Not me calling them(kid and cat) assholes. Kitkat
Cat's are funny. We have an elderly cat, that I is.. let's say... stubborn, vocal, and overall just not very pleasant, but she's getting old so I cut her some slack. My 8m/o daughter can do absolutely anything to her, and she will just chill and take it, purr away, and then come back for more a few minutes later.
This picture is the best most sweetest piece of happy Ive seen today..
Is that a /r/torties I see? Hard to tell from this distance
This photo signifies innocence, love and care, all in peace :)
Calvin and Hobbes
This thread is two weeks old and this will probably never be noticed, but I just wanted to say kudos to you OP for eternallizing this moment. It is a very powerful picture.
This is Red Mountain Park in Mesa, AZ isn't it? Lived near there for a long time.Cute kid and cat btw. i just got my 7 year old his first cat and he's absolutely in love with her.
Except the cat was probably plotting to drown your son.
This picture is everything
That’s awesome, I have a Siamese that is the same way with my two year old.
Best friends!!! If you ever needed a babysitter who better then her? I love cats!
This is so f’n adorable.
Great pic!
This is beautiful
This is so precious.
Such a darn sweet photo. Melts my heart dammit.
Now I want to have a kid and a cat. Beautiful snap mate
May I use this as a desktop background?
I love this so much
This is seriously the most adorable photo I’ve seen all week. Thank you, OP
Fuck I love this picture.
just aaawwwwww
This made my day. ❤️
/u/titletoimagebot
I have a tortie named Sage. She is sweet to me, but hissy to everyone else. I'm so glad your son has a bff like your cat.
u/TitleToImageBot
This almost brings a tear to my eye. One of the best pictures I have ever seen! Thank you.
I was looking to see if you have an Instagram. These are some really nice photos.
Well god damnit this is cute as hell
She looks like a tortie princess so understand your confusion.
Its awesome
Beautiful image.
Would love to see what both of them are thinking.
That is one of the best pictures I've seen in a very, very long time.
If they head butt then the love is mutual
man this is like a stock image and perfect poster material
Wow nice picture how does the cat sit stil out in public do you have a leash.
😻
Literally cutest picture ever!
This picture just made me tear up. I have cat I’ve had for three years now and he’s the best little friend I could ask for. I hope if I have children one day, he will bond with them just like your son and fur baby.
The best picture ever
This is the most precious thing I have ever seen!
OC? I like it!!
Aaawww
Buds^
This is a pretty picture
....which shows love!
I enjoy this pretty pictures
i like the way the grass waves
Get another cat that can learn from her! So when this old gal passes, he has another cat to lean on.
did anyone else notice the blue water?
This is adorable
I really need this right now.
calvin and hobbes right here :)
Little boys are a lot like cats
this pic needs an award
This is such a beautiful picture
You should definitely print and frame. ❤️
That's a pretty kitty
You can tell that it's almost fall
Is his name Calvin?
Congratulations your cat is meme worthy
Why does that cat not move?
That is such a beautiful picture! From a fellow cat owner and parent, this fully warms my heart. I love to see how my cats love my daughter. 💕
Heart melted. So sweet!
I am wondering what your son is saying to the kitty right now "like what if cat was really spelled D-O-G?"
This is adorable
He is pure and she is evil, together they are Pure Evil.
Oh my heart....
Great photo
Quite possibly one of the most touching photos I've ever seen and I know nothing about your family, yet I feel like your family is loving and close just seeing those two.
Reminds me of our son and two cats.   Very awesome.
This is so beautiful. I can’t wait to have my own children one day and get to experience the kids and the cats forming adorable bonds like this.
In the words of Chandler "could this picture be any cuter?"
This picture is so nicely taken.
r/torties
This is so heartwarming. You were able to capture some amazing quality photos you’ll treasure for a lifetime. And this is coming from a non cat person. Lol
This made me cry because it so adorable! Beautiful picture!
My heart 😭💝
Tolerate is the operating word here lol
Animals are smarter than we think
So fucking precious
This is so so adorable!
That picture is cute AF, definately a keeper.
This title fits this image beautifully. What an adorable family. They will surely have great adventures together.
catdog
That's so beautiful. Fantastic pic
Gorgeous Calico!
Classic cat. Doesn't love you back, just tolerates your love. I love cats.
So cute!!
i think your cat is an especially nice and patient cat, and your son is lucky to have her. my daughter has loved our cat since the day she was born, but he just doesn't give a shit. ㅠㅜ
Amazing. I’ve currently got my 3 week old boy on a pillow to my side and my 7 year old tort on my lap. This photo is my dream for them. First fur, first human... becoming best friends. This is confirmation of what I want for those two. Thanks for sharing.
Oh the cuteness!!!
I noticed how most cats are super gentle with toddlers, even when they are being unruly and playing rough. The cat would just tap it a few times with paws, never pulling out the claws and scratch.
I love this so damn much. I have a cat who is my whole world, and my husband and I are going to try to have children soon. I can only dream that my future child will have a relationship with my cat like this.
Calvin and Hobbs
Lovely cat. Reminds me on my Freya. 😭😭😭 miss her so much
I had a similar cat protector as a kid, name was black cat. I hope they have a lot of really fun adventures!
My cat has always loved my son like this. He’s super protective and always follows him around outside. 🙂
Your cat thinks your son is the family pretty.
This ..is ..beautiful..sir.
That’s a keeper
That's your son, but he's HER boy.  My late cat loved my son with a passion as they grew up together.  It is sweet as can be.
This is beautiful.
[reminds me of this album cover](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4185572700_5.jpg)
If I was a parent and a pet died that my child loved I would have absolutely no clue how to deal with that. I guess thats why we have reddit. Sorry for being sad or whatnot
A boy and his cat.
That picture - wow. Forever a family heirloom. You  love it now, but can’t even begin to imagine what it will mean to you later. I promise.
Awesome click... I also clicked my daughter's pics ND video with 3 kitty on backyard
I grew up with a tortie who looks a lot like your girl. She was one of the sweetest, smartest, sassiest cats I've ever known. If I was crying, she would find me and comfort me. When my mom yelled at me and my brother, she would bite my mom on the ankle. She passed away when I was 10 years old, 8 days past her 21st birthday. She had a good, happy life, and was a staple of our family. I'm glad that your son gets to grow up with such a good companion.
Reminds me of my old cat. Myself I am now 13 but my family had a tortoise shell tabby until last year. She was around even before I was born so she was like my sister and I’s older sister. She was very tolerant of everything we did. We pick her up and hug her for minutes and when we were done she would just hop on down and walk somewhere nearby and have a nap.
Those suspenders are fackin cute
/r/AccidentalRenaissance
This really is the sweetest
Come up with a funny caption, and you have a million-dollar greeting card
That's such a nice picture.
I hope this is both your cat and your son, what a lovely photo&#x200B;
*flashbacks from Of Mice and Men*
That's how animals love. Unconditionally.
Lovely photo!
Warm and fuzzies
Torties are the best! So much personality.
Fuck I miss my cat 😢
My kitty Momo tolerated my siblings and I as grabby toddlers, but totally loved us any way. Our family was lucky to have 21 great years with him.
He's going to be a very good person.
upvotes for everyone!!!!!
People tout dogs as the most affectionate, which is true... But you either have to earn a cat's love or it has to just..know...that you're worth loving
Such a beautiful image. Thank you for sharing, made my day better :)
Animals are great as long as they are treated right and loved they'll treat you right and love you back. Great picture
Plot twist: OP is the cat
Toddlers in suspenders are always adorable.
This is something that I hang to my wall
Omg, you cannot stage that.
This reminds of that scene from Inception except there’s a little boy and cat instead of a little boy and girl
Welp, time to add this to the list of cats that can never die
That's living.
That is indeed a fantastic picture!
Aww, so cute.
What a perfect shot. So many cats grow up with babies and children, and you think the cat must hate being dragged and hugged and dressed up, but they love it. They love their person unconditionally. They tolerate the grabby little hands and grow to love them forever. As your son grows up the cat will love him even more and its beautiful.
Cats are the most wonderful creatures. I've never had a cat that wasn't filled with love and personality. These are beautiful pictures, thank you
If he doesn't graduate.. I'll take him and love him forever and ever and ever and ever
Im sorry but this cadet is not fit for duty. Please send it to me for cuddles.
Holding the dog should help with his nerves.
You can do it!^please ^dont ^take ^my ^weed

We're grateful for his service, it can be a ruff job.
The pup doesn't look too bad either...
First day after all the training on how to be a good boy.

He’s just nervous on his first day. He’s going to be great out there!
Is he yours to keep?what is his name? Can I have your job?
Cute baby
What a cutie
The cadet looks really nervous. But that smile will take the cadet's nervousness away.
Awe my sister is crying shocked that a do* could be that cute
Good pupper you got this!!

Id be nervous too if I knew I was about to be forced into a life of law enforcement without any choice in the matter.

Sucks they put unwilling puppers in a dangerous field of work :-(
So cute. To bad he’s gonna make a lot of potheads life shitty. Still cute though.
I'd be nervous, too, if I was going to be trained to unquestioningly obey a handler who would order me into situations that were too dangerous to risk a human officer's life, like I was some sort of expendable drone or robot.  Seriously though, police "K9 units" are morally indefensible.
He should be nervous. Guarantee its not his fucking choice. Poor guy.

Aww he’s hoping for a relaxing loving life but since he’s a cop doggie that means no fun in his life and no caring owners

If the dog is looking like that, they are not going to grow up to be an effective police dog; if that's what you're using it for.
How do you not play with that dog after that?
You throw that toy right now!
That shiny fur though
"I'm the Facebook now"
*quits job; plays with dog for ever*
If you dont play with that dog so help me god
want to feel sad? reverse it... http://imgur.com/a/Q8t7r
Windows has been closed by Dog.exe."Fetch" must be run before restart.
It was cute at first but then when he picked up the toy and nudged it towards you I lost it
I imagine that dog saying "Hey buddy, I said you needed to look after my baby. Here take him again I am heading out back for a while"
I watched this gif while poopin' and right as the doggo put the toy down my kitten put her little paws up on my leg and just looked at me as if to say, "take note, human"  I'll put my phone in my pocket after this comment and pet her.  Then I'll finish poopin'
Very subtle! Love it!
even your dog knows facebook is cancer
 1. Be a dog 2. Do something /r/aww worthy 3. Sell as lakefront property 4. Profit
What breed is that? I've recently adopted a stray that looks similar
Enough of that, come play with your Labtop!
Play with him you monster
Human I have matters of great importance that we must discuss over a game of fetch.
FUCKING PLAY WITH HIM ALREADY
13/10 pupper. Would boop the snoot.
"She's not going to message you back, but *I* will bring this toy back if you throw it."

And we pull out the camera, have him do it again and post it to Reddit.    #INSTEAD OF PLAYING WITH DOG!
Plot twist: OP 's dog wanted OP to go play with the toy so that he (OP's dog) could check his own email.
If you didn't play with him you're a goddamn monster and you know it.
Hello this is dog.
those eyes. my heart. i think i have ovaries now.
That doggie came prepared, had his toy all ready to go
STILL HAVE YOUR CHRISTMAS TREE UP, EH?
Priceless!!!
Your dog is adorable, mine just decides to shit everywhere when he needs/wants something. Still love him though.
This could be my dog ffs.. Same kind of behaviour, same looks.. I am flabbergasted
It's sad that I know this video is old based on Facebook's layout
I always liked /r/aww but this time i felt my heart melting. What a sweety! Cancel your internet subscription, play with him/her every spare second.
That's the first oost I've seen with over 100k points ...
OP talked to the dog before this video to create a cute video. OP is a big fat phony
That is fucking adorable!
r/aww living up to its name.  Go play with your doggy!
Just imagined my dog doing that to me in the middle of an intense game of Dota. Triggered.
My dog does similar where he'll nose my hand right up off of my mouse while I am sitting at my desk.
I like how you were looking at a pic of a dog on facebook.   And your dog was sorta like, "f--- that, I'm the only dog that matters."
Jesus christ, I miss my dog. He used to do the same thing :'-)
Dog: Please, enough is enough! (pushes screen down) You have been scrolling since Christmas and the tinsel has lost its novelty.... Here's a stuffed animal dog as a reminder that you have a real one... aww, who am I kidding...

Dogs, there to remind you of the essential in life.
My dog will act like he wants to play, then when I put aside my laptop and get down on the floor with him he walks away and lays down. He's a brat.
The dog is tired of all your facebook shit posting
Go play with her you MONSTER.
Play with the dog you monster. 😢
Jesus Christ I love dogs.**Walks away to go and hug all 3 of my family dogs**
you better have played with that dog!
One question: why did he happen to be filming when it happened? So cute though! :-D
You have time for Facebook? That means you have time for me, stuffed toy me, and ffs put away that Christmas tree. Unless you were starting early for 2017... please carry on.
It's cute, but if that became a habit fuck would it be annoying.

"But Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad"
There's no way I could be upset by that.
mah heart, this is the one thing that I am looking forward to the most after I finish school and have a steady income. For today, the thought of spoiling a pupper like this one will get me through my ochem homework!
This should absolutely be the #1 thing on the internet rn.  We all needed this.
I legit awww'd
You better have left the damn Internet and played!
okay alright this is legitimately the first time I have ever awww'ed out loud at something.thank u for warming my cold, dead heart
Holy fukin 100k upvotes
Just came here to be a part of the 100,000+ upvote party.Carry on.
is the dog smart enough to know that you are concentrating on the screen; so closed it so you look at him?
My golden retriever stands up & pushes my headset off my head when he's tired of watching me play video games.Luckily he's cute.
Hold on buddy. I have to go post this on reddit for gold.
"Fuck you, recording this and putting it on the internet instead."
I like to think the guy in the PC doesn't even own a dog.
Some dogs are forever puppers, it's awwdorable.
Oh my god, I just can't handle that tail.
Damnit Frank, you've been on Facebook all day. I have needs too!
Once you go black...
Time to invest in a desktop!And treats, because if that good boy doesn't get overfed then you're wrong.
He knows he's been a good boy!
Dog invited you to play fetch. Accept?
This is so pure. Love! :')
I want a dog right now! Must get off internet!
Thank god this is the top post, honestly.
Bribing hoooman
How could someone turn down that?
So instead of playing you posted this to reddit?Bad hooman!
My dog does this when I'm eating something nice. He'll bring me his bone and tilt his head like, "Swapsies?"   NO! Get your own Italian BMT you lazy freeloader.
Good dog!
How can you say no to that?
You better have played with that dog..
You get the hell off the internet RIGHT NOW!!!
I recognize that toy from a McDonel happy meal a few years ago.FYI
I have 5 kids, when I think I have a moment of peace, the dog comes up for his attention.
To this dog's credit, playing with dogs is 1000x more fun than sitting on facebook.
"Come on Buster just learn the fucking trick so I can get some karma"
u/fleaaaa
One of my dogs was sitting next to me looking for attention while I was watching this. I than realized that I was selfishly watching random dogs on the internet instead of giving my own damn dog attention. He's now sitting on my lap as I type this and about to get a treat.
if you don't play with him right now i swear to god
This is one of this posts just made me squeel  audibly in the library. So cute.
Ha ha.  Nice.  Our version:  http://i.imgur.com/5dRA46W.jpg
Ah, yes. The true difference between cat and dog owners.
That shiny coat though!
This actually made me go play with my dog
Nah. "Opens up Reddit, makes post, refreshes comments for the next 5 hours."
ITT anthropomorphising the mindset of dogs.
And............The Dog Wins......   Cheers!
Did you train him to do that 0_0
Wow. Hahaha. What a friend :)
Good dog!
That pooch sure has a mighty beautiful coat!
"Lazyass, quit messing with that thing and help me raise my puppy."
Most adorable thing  I've seen this year
Omg I can't deal, he even picks the toy up to give to you omg too adorable
That dog's fur is so silky
I love dogs.
Fur babies can teach humans important lessons such as putting down the electronics and appreciating the real life around us.
Just adorable. My dog does this too, sometimes straight knocks my phone out of my hands lol
Oh this is so adorable!
aweeee.... :) this is cute
That's literally one of the cutest things I've ever seen.
Well done.  No words needed.
He's kindly reminding you, life is not on Facebook it's right in front of your face.
Oh maaan, my little dogs do similar things to me all of the time when I'm at my computer.Chances are, if I go afk during a game it's because my dogs have hopped up in to my lap and I can't not play with them xD
Such a shiny coat!
Awe, sweetness 🐾
Children would do this if they could.
We don't deserve dogs. They are too pure for us.
When I forwarded this to my wife she got the wrong idea from the title...
awww he's such a good boy!
Oh the irony in this video haha
You heard him.
Would delete internet to play with
awww so cute
FML! I need a dog.
And saving you from the cess pit that is Facebook nonetheless. Good boy!
Took my dog for a walk right after I saw this.
Please tell me you played with him you horrible monster how could you
Now that's a good boy!!
Anyone who says no to that doesn't deserve a dog
Staged
not very often do I say "awwwww" out loud but this is definitely one of those times... play with that puppy damn it!!!!
I just love dogs.
Pet him you monster
those eyes, how could you not?
"Aww, adorable!! Now fuck off, I'm gonna get HUGE internet points with this."
Put the laptop down for a long time. My dog died last year and he used to "bug" me like this. Mostly I put the laptop down but I still regret the few times I didn't.
As an owner of two dogs if they are acting like this it means I am not giving them enough attention. I have to ask myself, why do I have dogs if I don't want to play with them? Then I have to ask myself, why am I on the computer when these dogs want to show me how much they love me?
Play with that dog this second!
awwww this is so cute. haven't logged in for a bit but once I saw this... oh wait. kinda against the point, no? ah well. cute dog lifted my spirits for the day so lemme know if you ever need a dogsitter. or director of marketing so you can spend more time with this awesome friend of yours :)
This is my dog with my phone everytime I get home. The initial greeting is never enough and my phone is evil for taking away precious Eevee(my dog) attention.
And how many little children feel that way?  Are stories still read at bedtime?  Are babies rocked to sleep?  I hope so.
The fur is so shiny 😍
I thought this was a risky click until I saw what subreddit this was from.
And just like that r/aww has a new all-time top post!
its sad
Awwww cutest way to ask to play
Why this video has been posted to the r/awww and not to the r/lifestruggle? I mean,it's cute to watch it, but if you experience it daily well you feel a little pinch 😜
Dogs are the greatest thing we ever discovered as a species. I say that with 100% conviction.
Awwwwwww
It gets cuter everytime i watch it
I just said "oh good boy, GOOD BOY" out loud, and involuntarily.
This is sooo cute! it reminds me of my own dog who rubs against my leg like a cat when he wants attention :D
Take this toy as a token of my appreciation, human
I'm sure he wouldn't do that if it was Reddit instead of Facebook
That's a very happy and healthy pupper, such a shiny coat
And you just happen to be recording video.
[removed]
You kinda have to at this point.
/u/bexnoodles19
My dog does this, except he tries to bite the corner of my laptop.
Doggo does an irl meme
this is absolutely adorable
It's ironic. Your dog tells you to leave the internet and at the same time your dog wins the internet for you. Congrats!
"John close your fucking laptop... Now.. Throw this toy for me"
When bae wants to "try out a new toy."
This is best thing I saw today!
I'm throwing away my lap top after that..
Huuuumannn. Come play with me instead of internet!
I'm now certain I'll never see anything this cute ever in my life again
You heard the doggo. ***Get to it!***
"damn it, put the phone away too!"
okay.
I love this soooooo much! Very, very cute doggo!
Love it
if you can say "no" to that then you have no heart!!
ok thats just fucking cute
Well... YOU DID RIGHT?
So cute!
Dogs discourage laziness, cats invite it.
Awww :)My mom's dog is a bit less tactful. She squeezes herself under my arm to go sit on my lap to push the laptop off.
lol. I honestly think I could live with only using reddits /r/aww section.
In this case, its a retorical question.
Well that's bloody adorable.
Damnit...ok, lets go play.
This doggos is the little dose of reality we all need.
Memba dog?
Ouch. This hurts....I just had to put my oldest dog down yesterday :(
I love him.
Awww, what a sweet one! I hope you played. How can one resist???
That's so adorable.
This is incredibly adorable. But could see this getting old REAL quick if you're trying to get something important done. lol
Do not deny it of fun, throw that chew toy!
Thats just adorable!Of course we can play!.
What a good doggo
Love that facebook was of doggo.
I can't handle this, just too cute!
You are now under moral obligation to play tug of war with that little doggie until he gives out.
Thats a thing of beauty.God I love dogs. Give him a hug from me.
Wiiii
I went to hug my dog after :3
Ha! My dog does the same!
dogs are like young children that you can tell to shut up
Look at me!
Okay :)
>"Leave the internet and come play with me."(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
That laptop though! E5510? One a my faves.
I instinctively repeated "pup pup" after watching this.
Haha that's great! As soon as I turn off my desktop for the night, my dog runs up from where she's been hiding and looks at me longingly! :)
Cute Doggo level over 9000!
Wow she looks exactly like my dog. Calla https://imgur.com/gallery/GYSPK
Dogs are too good. We don't deserve them.
My heart just grew two sizes.
This is a SUPERB PUP! I take it you don't make him/her subject to a ball machine. Human interaction for the win :D ❤️
Or you could film the dog and put it on the internet...
how the hell on earth they do it
Wow dogs are so intelligent!
And I shall
"I've been a good boy, come play"
My best buddy will do this all day when I pickup my Playstation controller :)
Fucking aww!
What a pretty coat!
All the feels
Maybe he was just jealous that you were checking out other people's dogs on their Facebook wall
You play with him right now!
"Dammit, Barbara. You've been home for FIVE minutes. What do I have to do to get a little family time?!"
The message is loud and clear.
For fucks sake take down your tree man!
Sooo cute
Okay!  I'll be right there!
Impossible to say no
Most of your pet's life is spent waiting for you to pay attention.
Go play with them dammit
This made me smile :)
A thousand times this. There's been a bunch of times where I'll be messing around on my phone, look down at my dog and think "I've got this crazy, interactive thing right here in front of me. I should be playing with *that*."
come on please
Dogs are the best
PLAY WITH THE PUPPY!!!
Do it, hooman.
This is a sign for all Redditors that have a dog. Get off Reddit and go play with your dog.
I love how at the end he pushes it to you, like see how fun it is, your turn.
fuck that's adorable. have all the upvotes
Aaw little baby how beautiful he is <333 Those eyes and how shiny his fur is, what a cutiepie. :) Would be the best interruption ever!
"Nah. I'm just gonna take this video of you and post it on the Internet instead."-OP
I think that is my dog!! Lol Defiantly from the same litter.
Cute baby!! Lucky you! 🤘🏻
I unexpectedly got nostalgic with that because I had that toy as a kid, I got if from McDonalds if I'm not mistaken, and I fucking loved the little plushy.
I love dogs
If this dog isn't being playing, someone is going to get in trouble
[loses all progress on the research paper due tomorrow]
Also have a black lab. Can confirm.
Now I understand what my cat is trying to do...
I'm in love!
Awwest thing I've seen in a while
This is legitimately the most adorable thing I have ever seen.
That's so annoyingly cute
OK, but first let me post this on the internet.
Easily the most adorable video on reddit
"Nope dawg, but thanks for this adorable video"*Immediately re-opens lid and sets sails to aww*
what breed is this?
Awww😘
Aww... After that you just have to play with the damn dog. There is no other choice.
What a beautiful coat!
/r/rarepuppers
What kind of dog is this? I got one from a shelter that looks exactly the same but they didn't say what kind he was
That coat look really smooth
YOU PLAY WITH THAT GOOD BOY RIGHT NOW! :U
My chocolate lab does the same thing
my heart. it is melting
Wanna play on the computer? Ok let's play on the computer.
I'm going go play with my black lab now.
Aww...  : -)
And then he opened the laptop back up to post the video he just filmed
You will miss him when it dies. Play fetch now!
That's the sweetest thing I've seen all day!!!
Dogs are the best things ever.
What makes this even better is that the facebook page he is on has a profile picture of that dog haha.
Dogs are always a good reminder of the important things in life :)
What kinda dag is that?
That's a good dag
LABtop
Heartless human! Get off the webz, stop recording me and play damn you!
Why are you still online, OP?
Sooo sweeeeeeet
At least someone listened to obamas speech last night
lapdog
I was ignoring my own puppy while reading Reddit until I saw this. GO PLAY WITH YOUR DOG! They're only with us for a short time and they have so much love to share.
As much as I'd love to have a pet, this is why I don't get one. I simply wouldn't be in the mood to play with it 85% of the time.I wish there was like a humane, on-demand, 'Rent-a-Pet' service.
I recognize that toy from a McDonel happy meal a few years ago
Poor baby!!
My dog will randomly paw at me to pet her while playing COD.  As soon as I do someone comes around and jacks me. I try to wait till intermission but she is too cute.
If anyone else did that I would be madBut in this case I would be like dam that was pretty cool, sure I will play
Look at that shiny coat!, he must get a lot of eggs
lol adorable... my doberman just comes and puts his entire head between me and my screen and stays there when he wants to play.
He's a good boy, you better play with him.
My man heart just exploded.  Play with them!!!
what breed is that?
shut down your facebook and go play with that dog, you cruel inhuman person!
That's fucking adorable.
Aww..this is such a sweet video. I got really scared at first. from the title I thought it was about a pedofile telling a little girl on the internet to go "play"with him in real life.
I wonder if he able to play with his dog or continued *interneting* after posting this.
This dog knows what's up! (Y)
Its all cute when the dog does it, but when your wife says it.....*starts crying*
It looks like you were looking at the Facebook profile of someone who is now married. Maybe your dog is trying to say "Get over her/him. You still have me"
You go pet that dog now!
Wait till he knocks the controller outta your hands while you're trying to capture C
I've hand-trained ferrets fresh from their pre-human pack, I've never had one go back to hurting once they know that you simply aren't as tough as them.With dogs and cats, I will put my hand into their mouths when they are highest energy, let em chew me up to the point of discomfort and make a sad/hurt sound. The little lovelies correct, every time. =*DIf only humans were so empathetic and responsive
Any time my kitties do this I always drop whatever technology I'm looking at and play.
who can say no to him!
Proceeds to take out phone to record video, opens laptop back up and posts video for internet points.
This is my cats every morning except its my bed and not the internet
Irony: Facebook won't let me repost this to my page.
Dawww okay you win the internet tonight
Dawww okay you win the internet tonight
Dawww okay you win the internet tonight
aww
I had that same plush toy when I was a kid! What an unexpected nostalgic start to my day!
What a shiny coat!
So shiny!
Cute
my pup does something similar. if I'm sitting on the couch or something and am on my phone, he'll stick his head under my hands and try to push my phone away so I'll give him pats
This literally made me aww out loud
Such a good doggo.
This made my morning. :)
D'awwI'm a little sad now since my little boy doesn't have much of a yard and the temperature actually hurt his paw ;-;
My 2 year old will do that.  Makes me feel like a bad mom, but I always play with him when he does it.
Let's play! Woooooooooooooo hoooooooo!
Holy fuck that's cute.
This reminds me of the end of Unfriended.Did anyone else watch Unfriended? It was a fairly average movie. Unique, but average.
Wow I can tell that dog really loves you, you must be a really good owner. Nice jobs dude.
My dog knocks the phone out of my hand when I'm screwing around on Reddit.
Can someone please tell me what kind of dog that is?
The way he just closes that laptop and gets up in your face with the toy how can you say no to that? :)
Go play ya heartless bastard!
More dogs should do this.
That toy is such a throwback, I'm gonna say happy meal?
Our dogs do this to us all the time. They use their paws to close the laptop on us. We give them plenty of attention but they never seem to get enough lol.
I can't say no to that face. >_<
I really needed that after watching that video on /r/rage
One cannot leave the internet
I hope you went and played with your dog mate ;)
What kind of dog is that?
That's a good boy.
"Excuse me sir, have you heard of the church of fetch?"
How could ANYONE say no to that???
*[SAW Horror Movie Theme Plays](https://youtu.be/hWaNoK3gN6M)* - I want to play a game.  In front of you is my toy, all you have to do is throw it and I'll fetch it.  However, it's covered in dog slober.  You have 2 minutes.  You can either grab it, slobber and all, or I will shit on your laptop when you're gone.  The choice is yours.
I need a dog like this
This is exactly what my girlfriend does.
This gif could break the internet
You better stop reading this comment right now and go play fetch. ^(You're still here? Did I stutter?)
damit! that is so adorable
cutest thing ever
Reminds me of a story from when me, my brother, and my sister were playing a game of Risk on the floor. Here we were in the middle of game when, all of the sudden, our cat pushes the game box right over the board, messing up all the pieces. I mean cats will often wreck games by wanting to play *with* the pieces, but actually pushing the box through all the pieces was something new. It was too funny for any of us to be upset.
Play with the dog you evil bastard
What type of dog is this?! My girlfriend and I have a dog that almost looks like its twin and we can't pin a breed down at all. We know she's part whippet, but can't get any other parts figured out.
Why do you still have your christmas tree up? :p
So cute!!!
I feel like this dog is a life coach. "Stop working so hard. Stop doing mindless stuff online. Let's go have fun!"
My dog does this except he'll jump up and sit on my hands as I'm trying to work
and this is why i cant have a dog. they are too needy and i dont want to waste the little free time i have to take care.
Been sick and laid up last couple days with a cold and this made me smile/cough/sneeze/smile.  Love the dogg-o's :)
"Stop messing with my facebook page"
How could you possibly refuse.
Adorable!
My jack Russel does this to my phone, she jumps up onto my lap and pushes my phone (out of my hand sometimes) with her snout till my hand where she wants me to stroke annoyingly cute
Omg, I don't care if I was in the middle of an email to my boss.  I must obey!  Plus by closing it you probably just put it into hibernation anyway.
My cat would just stand in front of the screen.  "Try ignoring me now."
Baum - Game will launch at $60.  Just kidding :).  Looking to charge 5 to 10 bucks.  It will be early access so I can collect feedback and improve the graphics.  The mechanics has been my main focus, so some of what you see is placeholder or will be iterated on.Shades - totally get what you're saying, and I have some good plans to make you truly feel like a space wizard, not just pixel NMS.
this dog is so polite.  Carefully closes the laptop and puts a small toy on it to play.My dog would launch a tennis ball across the room, bound after it crashing into wall and cats, grab it and run full speed and jump his 60lbs ass in my lap.It hurts.  But its cute so I allow it.
PLAY, YOU MONSTER, PLAY WITH EM!!!!
I'd much rather play with my dog than ever spend any time on facebook.
We should all get off the internet and go play with OP's dog.
Aww! lolHe's like, "Dude, c'mon, you have a responsibility as an owner to play with me."
 I want this puppers
I want a dog.
So he posts it on the internet... dog 0, Internet 1
This is a good reminder to take a break from the screen time and pay attention to what matters.
omg this. this is adorbs
I wouldn't be able to say no!
My heart just melted.
Puppers: If I can't beat internet, I will become internet...transformation complete.
I have a friend, or should I say acquaintance, who has a dog like this. Just last night we were playing overwatch and, over xbox live, I heard him say to the dog "if you dont stop licking my controller, I am going to break your neck."  I just don't understand how someone can be like that! He shouldn't be a pet owner.
[deleted]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6119  > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/45584)
😍😍😍😭😍
My cat every single time I want to watch Netflix
I've been having a super shitty day. This made me smile. Thanks, OP.:)
If you don't play with that dog, there will be war!
This reminds me of that adage"If a kid passes you a toy phone you fucking answer it!"
Dawwww!!!
I work from home and there's a dog shoving her heavy head into my lap with puppy eyes looking sadly up at me. Every day.
Now look at this toy, that i just found...
aww!
It's time to take that tree down redditor
As a person who just lost his dog, you should enjoy the time and play with them. It might someday make the biggest difference in the world to remember your furry pal happy.
Nobody hates the internet more than dogs.
Ahahah tira sta palla bastardo
"Thats enough cat videos, remember why dogs r good?"
Shit. With that face I'd throw my laptop away, quit my job, and just play with him.
Yaaammp.
Well who am I to turn down such an invitation?
Holy shiiit all the guilts are belonging to me.
we don't deserve dogs they're too good for us
What kind of dog is this? It's magnificent
Awwwwww. So adorrrrablllle.
All I can concentrate on is the fact that your tree is still up.
Does anyone have this as a .webm? This is amazing but the filesize is 14.4 megs... Difficult to share it.
Look how shiny that coat is :)
This my favorite thing like ever
wow thank you
THAT TOY WAS FROM MCDONALDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just take my karma.And... we're soon gonna see this ripped off everywhere online with millions of view
All this time on /r/aww this is the first time I've actually verbally went "Awwww" Freaking adorable.
Your dog saved you from facebook.
So adorable, I wanna have a dog like this one.
At that point I'd have no choice but to give in to play time.
I have a sad news for youYour dog is just showing you affection because it is afraid that you might find its hidden dog porn folder
Only if my dog would do that
This is the best!
Oh geez, I could never say no to that face.
Is that a half weimaraner half German Shepard?
Oh my I want a dog now
This is a cute overload, I can't handle it.
Wish my girlfriend said that to me...
such a sweet doggo
that's a shiny coat, OP!
Live in the now, hooman. And by now, I mean this toy.
Somebody better let that dog know that he is in fact a good boy
That's adorable <3
Without a doubt, he is a good pupper. I'm overtaken by this adorableness.
And OP did you end up playing with him?
I had a very loud moment of "awwwwwwwwwwwww" for this sweetheart
Lol
Decided to get back on the internet to post this? Poor doggy never got to play but hes on the front page
Awesome.
This is cute till he does it during a ranked match.
Oh boy, is it mixed breed? I've got a mixed breed doggie with exactly same face as this one. Do u know who were his parents? :O
This is upvotextortion.
/u/twatbox this one's for you!
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
That dog just wanted to eat that toy right in front of your face...^^
Awww such sweet and gentle eyes
A mcdonalds dog toy!! That brings me back
Fuck, I miss my dogs
Aww, thanks for the internet points! *opens laptop and posts video to reddit*
Dell makes that kind of hinged laptops? Looks nice.
For a moment there, I thought it said "leave thy Internet and come play with me"  I even chuckled to myself over that...
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The eye contact she makes when the laptop clicks shut
I would so.... Leave the Internet..
Awesome. you made it to the top 10 of the day on all!
I'm a simple girl, I see MyAnimeList, I upvote.
Zomg how could you resist that!!
How cute!!
"I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave".
please dog i want to surf the internet!!
You know you've been on the internet for too long, when even the dog betrays you for it's own selfishness!
My dog does something similar. Puts his snout under my hand when I'm playing on the phone.
But how do I upload this gif without it?
Congratulations you have a cat
sooo cute <3
velho amigo dog sempre ele.
You go play with that dog right now!Dogs are Man's best mobile device.
my cat does this too!!
So you decided not to play and instead to post the vid on the internet? Heartless...
How could you say no to that face?
My dog always tries to knock my controller out of hands when I'm playing video games
Proposed new HTTP Error level 6XX, for real life complications.    &nbsp;    HTTP 600 Adorable pet requires user resources.
"That's cute, but now I have to get back on Reddit and post how cute it is."
haha... my dog is just like this. Perfectly fine until I open a laptop or start looking at my phone!
hello world
You better go play with that dog.
My dog does this out lays on the keyboard.
Hit me right in the feels
My daughter used to do this till we got a crate.
Laptop would be dropped and my friend it's play time !
Doge knows about r/IRL
Get off the computer and play with that pupper!
This dog knows whats up.
You play with him right now you monster
That was so fucking cute.
Ohhh for sure i will say yes i leave everything to play with you!!!
You better never open that laptop again!
adorable
Awwwww....love meeeee!
Owners who have a pet near them, get off of Reddit and go pet him or her. Savor your time with them, please ;(
:)
u/BlackLabBot
Aww my heartt
Our fur baby's are smart.
Dogs vs Laptops, who will win the owners attention
I agree with puppers, Facebook <puppers.
You better have played with him
Man, I miss my dog :/
Even dogs know facebook is addiction
Now I feel bad about browsing reddit while my dog stares at me. Time to go out and play fetch with him.
Oh my god so cute, the relationship between man and dog cannot ever be replicated or surpassed
Not subtle, but it does get the point across.
Dog is doing a medical intervention regarding your Internet addiction.
This is why I don't have a dog, I would feel bad all the time for not playing with them.
AWWW SO CUTE
Love this so much
Well now I want a dog.
/u/Aidan_King me to you. Not at all ashamed that I act exactly like a dog.
Hey, hey, hey Every dog has his dayIt's a dog eat dogDog eat dog\m/
I work from home and this is my life every day. He just doesn't understand that I have to stay on the computer to buy more brown pebbles.
[removed]
You give me your attention now or else!
Omg sooo cute!!
Love this! Makes me miss my lab
"Okay, that's cool, but look at THIS."
You just can't deny a dog who needs a little  love once in a while!
What a sweet dog
i think the better question is, why were you recording that before your pupper decided to be cute
"Hello sir, can I introduce you to the church of DOG?!"
Adorable!!!!!
Doggo knew he was on facebook. He did him a favor.

Redditor's dog?
It goes to show you how much  society is disconnected from the  real world.  When computers and cell phones have alienate us from human to human contact. In this case human to animal.
Lmao
dam this is super awwwwww
I love how the dog's toy is a dog. 😂
I haven't seen anyone use Facebook on a computer in ages!
Awh I want a dog so bad!
I can feel the love radiating from that second picture. This is too beautiful for words.
Thank you for this. My cousin’s son has Downs. From birth, he hated strangers. When I first met him, he was almost a year old. My family said “don’t be discouraged if he doesn’t want to be around you.” The whole family surprised me at the airport and brought him. He surprised everyone by reaching for me immediately... and every moment after, he stuck to me like glue. He had this thing that he’d do with me and no one else (then or ever since) where he’d yell “ahhhhhhh” and lick my face. I’d tilt him over where his head was almost on the ground and he’d giggle like crazy and I’d lift him up straight and he’d yell again and lick my face and giggle until I’d lean him over again. It was Christmas week and I ended up being the person he chose to sit on my lap and open his presents. When he was 3 or so, I moved down there. I rented a room from family and he’d yell “KNO KNO” Like “knock knock” without the “k” and then stick his toes and fingers under my bedroom door. When he was convinced I had seen them, he’d bust open my door and climb in my bed and point to the tv. I could just continue doing my computer work while he watched cartoons in my bed as long as I let him wear my pajama pants as a scarf. Every time I looked over, he’d give me a huge grin. I haven’t been down there in 5 years or so. But I miss that kid so much.
I have a sister with downs and her mental capacity has declined so much of as late. This brings tears to my eyes because I know the beautiful heart she has and how she used to express it. I miss the love she used to show so much. Lately she barely acknowledges me. Thank you for making that loving gesture to your brother. His reaction is priceless.
So sweet! :) I have older sister with Downs. She's 37 now and I could not be more proud of her. She is so independent, she know how to read, write, sing, playing zither and much more. She can even prepare food on her own. &nbsp;It is important how much time do you spend teaching Downs people  in early life. My mother did a fantastic job; she pretty much dedicated her life for my sister. When she was born, doctors said that she won't be able to do any of those thing she can do it now. But my mother prove them wrong big time ! :)
Your bro is absolutely rocking that beard.
Well... here's another human with more courage than me, because I am too scared to hold a delicate baby.
The picture on the right brings a tear to my eye, such an amazing photo.Those with DS are some of the most loving human beings on this planet, and your photos show that perfectly.Thank you for sharing these awesome photos! <3
My son's not a baby anymore and he's sleeping now, but I had to go into his room and hold him for a moment and tell him I love him after seeing this.  I'm still crying.  I've had a pretty brutal month in a lot of ways and I didn't realize how much I needed this.Thank you for reminding me that love is something we all share and that we all need; that it's not complication and suffering and labor and hardship and duty; that it's simple and pure and joyful and fragile and the most important thing in life.  I need to love more like your brother does.  I think we all do.
Show him love for as long as he lives. Help him solve the little problems. I had a cousin with Downs that was not expected to live past 21. She lived into her 60's with love from the family. She learned to write her name and recognize some words. Her focus was amazing. I miss her.
Wow thank you Reddit! I'm legitimately choked up at all the kind things you internet strangers said. I wish I could communicate all of it to him. I'm really touched and can't wait to show my parents all the uplifting comments. 100% chance my mom will start sobbing in a good way (there is more rejection for him as an adult because maybe he is fidgety in public or does a number on someone's toilet 😂 etc. So with all the encouragement I bet she is going to be so torn up). I think you just gave her the best Christmas present ever. Thank you all a million times! Really, I had no idea so many people would be so goddamn nice.Note: I never actually heard the term downsie in a derogatory way but I can see how that might be a thing. I thought it was an affectionate reference. I hope it's obvious from the context it is meant to be loving.
This post is too pure for this world. So much love for you and your family.
keep showing him the love!!
This made me sob on my toilet. Can't wait to show it to my fiancé when I get out of here.
I HAVE A BABY YOU CAN HOLD DAMMIT.
Aw man. This makes me wish/ want to put in more effort to make a positive difference in someone's life everyday. Have my upvote.
Thank you for sharing this joy to the us all, what a beautiful thing to see. I’m sure he’ll be the best uncle & he will do so with such pride
I would have cried. Congrats on the baby and congrats on having such an amazing brother.
Oh my god man. Love him, he is the best there is. Thank you for sharing this, im going to wipe my tears now, man up and wait until evening to hug my daughter.
This instantly made me cry! So sweet ❤️😭
This is so perfect. Definitely an r/aww with some extra awwwwwwwww
Okay I'm officially done interneting now.  That second pic - I can't.  So pure and beautiful....
Fucking cute. Both of them.You can totally *feel* the love coming through the screen. Awesome pics. Warmed my old, cold heart right up and made my evening. Probably the day tomorrow, too.
I especially love the one on the right. The way your bro is so tender, and holding her so carefully - but still gets in the good snuggle and (presumably) a whiff of freshly clean baby. Ahh. Gotta love him💕
Reddit doesn’t deserve this much love, but thank you for raising awareness for downs. I almost cried at the line “...it’s rare someone lets him now.” What a travesty! People with disabilities, let alone downs, are some of the sweetest people on Earth. My brother has downs too and no matter what I’ll always believe he has to be the most down to earth person I know; he’s very kind to anyone he meets and happy to help in anyway. Shame on anyone who discriminated against people with mental disabilities.
I just had a daughter days ago... If the stars aligned I would let him hold her. The scope of life quickly changes when visceral love is involved. Long live happy people and humanity.
This warms my cold, dark heart.
Every baby should be cuddled like that, and everyone should get to cuddle a baby like that. So much love in these photos.
That is so sweet! My autistic brother, who is also low functioning, likes to pet animals but he likes to push the skin on their heads back so their eyelids lift off their eyeballs so he can look under their eyelids. It’s super creepy and I stop him every time he does it but the animals keep coming back for it so it must not bother them too much. We used to have a cat that would sit there and purr as he poked and prodded her like that. Edit: Your Brother is so gentle and affectionate. You are super lucky that he has those qualities.
That's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
😊
My heart is so happy for him, that’s so awesome!!! :)
This look reminds me of my late uncle who had severe CP, and when he held his brothers(my uncle) child for the first time. My uncle passed 5 months after my cousin was born. It’s a look someone cannot easily forget. This is the most goddamn heart felt thing reddit has ever provided. And DAMNIT we’re crying as a team.
This is my life's work ideal of helping families *get here*. I am jelly and so happy. This is not about me but I needed it, thank you for the inspiration.
Good on you OP, he looks so happy :)
Congrats on the little one OP!
Right on.
cute as hell
Your daughter is going to have a really cool uncle.
I have a fairly negative view of humans on r/aww........but damn it, rules are meant to be broken cause that gets me right in the feels. ❤️
Holy shit there are some awful comments here.
My brother also has Down syndrome. This is a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing :)
"I love this baby, I love everyone"
This should be on r/upliftingnews. Love seeing happy folks :)
Thank you for sharing this most awesome photo.  After a trying day this makes my heart smile.
That's beautiful. I wish you well, into the future. I hope your baby can reciprocate, one day.
That second picture is how I always felt cuddling with my babies. Now they're too old, but I recognized that look. So adorable.
Beautiful. <3
Ok, call me old news-- but how has "downsie" become a specified term of endearment for this demographic?
Is ‘downsie’ a thing?
That's Fuckin precious.
Is “downsie” the affectionate term used for people with Down syndrome? Or are you just being a brother
You're a good brother and father. I'm sorry for your brother's condition. I hope your whole family has many more beautiful moments like this.
Omg the baby plucked his eyeball out *Kill Bill* style.
r/MadeMeSmile
He is gonna be an amazing uncle, never separate the two. That is an amazing show of pure love and connection.
❤️ pure ❤️
Pure love... thank you for sharing this
The amount of love he has in that right photo is insanely beautiful and so innocent. That is truly beautiful.
This hits home for me, as I have a younger sister with Down Syndrome and she loves babies. It's a complicated situation, as she also has Autism and she doesn't necessarily know when a baby has had enough - whenever she sees a baby she will immediately try and stroke it's hair. That can be a bit disconcerting when she runs to a pram being pushed by a parent who has no idea what's going on. You can't keep tabs on her all the time either. I am yet to have children but I know that in this situation, which will hopefully happen to me one day, it will be a strange mix of love and fear at the same time when I hand my child over to my little sister to hold.
Honestly, God Bless you, your brother and your family
So adorable, way to make it happen for him 😊
When they a picture is worth a thousand words,  I'll know to show them this.  It's simple yet holds so much beauty and love.  It truly speaks for itself thank you so much for sharing OP - may your brother be loved on so much more this Christmas -  he has a big heart ❤️
This is one of those beautiful moments in life we all need a little more of :). So heartwarming, it makes me happy
I love this post! It’s so heart warming
That indeed is incredibly cute. :)
Looks like he gives amazing hugs
I am a recently new father and I am nearly in tears that you got to share this joy - the joy of holding a baby - with your brother. Happy holidays.
Looks like a good guy. Got a good beard going too!
And this folks, this right here is 100% true absolute love. Its beautiful.
This is absolutely beautiful ❤️
That's a true precious moment.
This is beyond words beautiful.
Why’d you gotta make my cry man :,)
That is such a beautiful moment you captured, thanks for sharing it 😢🙂
My son has Down syndrome as well, he’s 4 now. He has cousins who are babies and he’s amazing with them, always kissing and hugging them lol. Great post op!
I am very fortunate to have worked with Down syndrome students. These students were nothing but love. I could be having the  the shittiest day but I knew as soon as I walked into the classroom, I would be greeted by the most genuine smiles and hugs and it would brighten my day.
Thank you for sharing with us ❤❤❤ your bro is a sweetheart
Frame it
His face is made of pure joy.  Bravo for you and the wife sharing this with him and making him so happy. I hope you have many more moments like this with him.

I actively reject holding babies
I want to appreciate how you used the term "downsie", because I've had a lot of struggle with this issue in the past.  My sister was born mentally retarded (Chromosomal Deletion and born without a Pulmonary Valve) and I've been crass with my language in the past, but the word "retarded" always struck an awful chord in me when I hear it in regular conversation.The truth is the more that vocabulary spreads, the less power it holds, and this has helped me to come to terms with the word.  From reading your post, I can empathize with where you're coming from, and I might be reading to far into this, but it really does make me happy to see the word "downsie" something so traditionally derogatory, turned against its meaning, towards one of empowerment.
They both look so content. So sweet. My aunt has Williamson's and loves babies, we call her the baby whisperer. Give her a baby, baby goes to sleep.
Great story, thanks for sharing!
More please!
That's beautiful.
My Goodness. Love in its purest form. I will remember this beautiful picture for the rest of my life. Thank you for sharing it with us. Please give your brother a big hug for me.
He's going to be a good uncle.
This is such a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing it with us all :’)
That's pure love right there. There is hope......
all the love i’m glad he has her. i’m glad she has him. i’m glad they both have you. blessings all around. <3
I always thought downie was an insult...
Such a great picture.
That really perked me up. Been a rough day.Edit: Thanks for the smile :)
Downsie? My sis has downs too but I never heard this word.
You've got one hell of a brother, OP. Cherish these moments, and let your children know that just because their uncle is a little different, he doesn't love them any less. Hell, it seems like he loves them more than the average person would for their own niece/nephew. Much love, from one person with special needs family to yours. Happy holidays
Being an uncle is great. He's gonna love it.
"Downsie" ? I've literally never heard that before, but it sounds wrong.
I have a brother with Down syndrome . He loves babies too . Lucky he has a sister who has 4 so far lol . He’s an amazing helper too. I have many pictures of him holding all my kids .
This is beautiful.For the last 2 years I have had a child with Down syndrome in my kindergarten/Grade1 class. I sobbed last week when it came time for them to move out of my room.It has now become my dream to work with people who have Down syndrome.
He loves that baby. Compassion and love, the best human traits.
Everyone deserves love
The power of kindness and love!
What a beautiful moment to have preserved like this! Everything from her obvious comfort in his arms, to his sense of peace when she settled against his shoulder. His joy radiates. Thank you so much for sharing this with the wider world.
This is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing. You're a good brother, I am sure of it.
That's just awesome man.
Omg, they are so cute! Such a beautiful moment, thanks for sharing this with us. :)
You are just the best brother
This is beautiful. Thank you for sharing this. Made me smile on my boring work commute.Much love to your brother, family and beautiful little girl from rainy London Town
That's love. 💘

My brother has down's syndrome and from what I see, has a monobrow similar to your brother's. Do you know if this a common thing among people with down's syndrome?
Be still my heart. This is beyond precious.
Oh man melted my heart ❤️
Who the f is cutting onions here?
Who's cutting onions...
Very Very cool ! I have a sweet cousin  who is fairly high functioning, in fact, functioning far better than most allegedly normal people, unusually she is almost my age, 54! She's just great!
Do you ever give him dolls?
My sister has an undiagnosed syndrome that comes with an overall developmental delay and some coordination issues. But she adores babies and little kids. It breaks my heart seeing some of my family members getting so edgy around her with them and limiting her interaction when she is well aware of her limitations. I'm due in January and I cannot wait to let her cuddle her new nephew all the time.
Wow. Our brothers are almost identical!
So beautiful, god bless him.❤
I can totally relate to your brother because I want to hold my cat like that but he won't let me :(
I wish even half the humans on Earth could have that much love in their hearts. I have no connection to him, but by just staring at this picture, I can FEEL his love. Your bro is a total bro, bro.
that is amazing and your brother is beautiful no matter his quirks
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a long time. Your brother is an angel and is going to be a great uncle!
Almost? I almost have to leave work early so no one sees me cry. That's awesome bud
The way you love your brother and the way he loves your daughter is beautiful
Why is it rare that someone lets him hold babies now? He looks so happy :) makes me happy
How old are both of them?
Look at the love in the picture on the right, so sweet!
These remind me I am lucky beyond measure. Thank you for sharing.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Awwesome
aw this is so pure
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen today.
The baby seems calm and at home with your brother, he obviously has the magic touch!
Lovely!
I was having a bad day until I saw this picture
That’s beautiful!
Wholesome af
That is so cute.
I LOVE this!  Beautiful picture.  He's just beaming and the baby seems pretty content with him.  Beautiful!
Jeez i thought he was the father at first. He's showing so much love here
Your brothers happiness is contagious.
OP almost cried....I did cry...the good kind
Aww bless! His face is full of such love and joy. Beautiful pictures
Thanks for sharing, absolutely beautiful! Definitely tugged at my heart strings
This is so god damn sweet. A piece of me just melted.
This post makes me feel truly inspired to be a better brother/son
This is really sweet! Babies know and understand that kind of love too.
Thank you for sharing something so beautiful; love and blessings to your family.
this is waaaay to beautiful for words to express.
Love it!
Beautiful!
In a bad mood and was considering why live life but this, THIS made me smile.
Seriously why won’t people let him hold babies anymore? So long as they have developed neck muscles he seems more than capable of holding one well. My dad had two strokes and only has the use of one hand and he constantly holds my son. There are days where it’s like he’s a baby whisperer and my son will only calm for him.
Literally made me teary-eyed ♥️ Sweet love
God is good😍. He is already being a loving uncle.  In return, your daughters perspective will be enhanced by just getting to know him. This made my night ❤️.
Too precious.
Please tell him I said his beard is epic. Edit: misspelled please
This is absolutely beautiful. What a wonderful uncle to have growing up!
This is the most adorable and perfect thing I've ever seen.I'm not crying, there's a stick in my eye.
This is honestly beautiful. This probably made you cherish your brother to an entirely new level. Levels just keep going up. Thanks for sharing.
You beautiful son of a bitch!!!  Love me some Downsies and babies!!!   Best of of both worlds Brother!!!  Mazel tov!!!
I wish i was as happy as this dude
This is beautiful snapshot of what pure, honest love looks like. Thank you for sharing.
:D
That's adorable.
Almost?! What kind of stone heart do you have?!
You definitely cried ;)
I’m envious of that beard!
Is it dusty in here or what? Fuck...
My heart sings when I see beauty in this ugly world.
So freaking cute!!!
Thank you so much for sharing this picture with us. I want to hug the both!
Love knows no boundary.
I'm gonna cry too
That is called love my friend. Both of them are happy to have you in life.
This reminds me of my neighbors dog, he was on his death bed, the vet said he'd live another two weeks at the most. I brought my puppy over to meet him, and he instantly got up and ran toward her. He start to play with her like this. He lived another six months, he came to our back door daily to see my dog and i'd let her out to play with him all the time. It was almost like he was asking if my pup could come out to play... how could you say no to that?Edit: [I felt obligated here's them playing](https://imgur.com/a/Bc9N3)
It's amazing how much hidden energy comes out of older dogs when they meet puppies.
I just love watching older dogs with puppies. When we got a puppy our senior dog was beside himself. He followed the puppy everywhere. He was half blind and he could barely keep track of the puppy but I'd never seen him so happy. He had always been a friendly, enthusiastic dog but the puppy gave him a second wind and maybe added a year or so to his life. That was nearly 12 years ago and now our puppy is an old dog. Their lives are just too fast.
I think the wrong gif loaded for me. I can only see 2 puppiesEdit; thanks /u/triconda for the gold :)) you made a depressing man's year end on a high.
This needs to go on longer
These are the same dogs from the gif where the puppy was a gift for the old dog. Anyone know if there is a full video?
This video makes me SO happy. I brought my 9 month old Bernese home to my senior, family lab. Prior to him meeting my puppy, he was super depressed after my other family dog passed last year due to old age. He was constantly needing snuggles and attention, very little play drive (which also, admittedly, comes with age), and refusing to walk in the grass or stay outside. He was super lonely due to living alone with my mom after years of canine companionship. Now he’s rough housing, chewing on bones, and playing all day with my pupper. (:
This is what my dogs experienced only in reverse in terms of size.  My 16.5 year old dog had the last 3 years of her life full of dealing with not one but two 25lbs that grew to eventually be100+lb big mastiff puppies bouncing around her poking and nudging her blind deaf bounce with each bark little 3lb body.   She was the boss and kept those two in line and they kept her younger. It was hilarious.
"I'm not too sure about this little guy."(Pup does dog hop)(Old dog does dog hop)"OMG, best friends!"
That long old snout had smelled the human condition forever, then one beautiful day, the sweet smell of young puppy.
Is it wrong that I read the title as “señor dog”??
Aww, this is like watching grandparents play with their grandkids at the park, but floofier.
I wonder if older dogs realize they were once puppies. Probably not, but a man can dream.
I have a 13 year old dog and we got a puppy this summer. He’s exactly the same way with the puppy - I swear she’s the only reason he’s still with us.
My whole life I've had golden retrievers and always would get a puppy when one of the dogs was 7 or 8 and life their lives. They showed this excitement every single time. The once puppy who met the old dog, then became the old dog and met the new young pup. I've always wondered if the old pup takes on the "parental" role and an instinct kicks in. Or if there's any science or study behind it. I've always observed them taking care of and following the pup
Adding a puppy to the family with an older dog can actually inspire  the older dog to hold on a few extra years :)
my uncle had two dogs , both friendly but never like, crazy happy and jumpy. When one died , the other got depressed and would nope all day. We got her a 4 month old sibling and after a week I’ve never seen her so happy and acting just like the 4 month old. It was like she had a new lease on life.
heckin good romp kiddo
The universe is cold and uncaringbut we have dogs.

"I'M not as good as I once was.. But I'm as good once as I ever was.."
Goldens are wonderful.
My senior dog [didn't feel the same way at first.](https://i.imgur.com/jxMXh3x.jpg)
Dogs grow old but they're always puppies at heart :).
Seriously thinking about getting a second dog. Only thing about my current dog I kind of dislike is that sometimes she wants to play and we have no energy. I've heard getting a second dog described as "getting an Xbox for your dog"
This is not always the case, my 2-1/2 year old golden can hardly stand my dad's 6 month old golden. First time I've ever seen him bare his teeth was only after hours of her chasing him around in circles trying to snarf his poor sopping wet face. He couldn't have been more thrilled to get home after Christmas!! He's still getting a younger sibling by the time he turns five. He needs someone to annoy the crap outta him, he's too damn lazy!!Edit: Having a 105 lb golden trying to hide from a 51 lb puppy who just wants to love and play is hilarious. Also, watching them almost figuring out tug of war was fun to watch.
/r/ContagiousZoomies
We had a pack of 3 for the longest time, and the 2 girls recently passed. Now we have a 14yr old, deaf Pitbull, and three 2yr old or younger other pups. It's crazy how our Pit went from being a grumpy old curmudgeon, to acting like this and playing with the pups. Probably helps we started giving him CBD (amazing!), but man it warms my heart to watch him play again.
I have two dogs. Ones a 8 year old boxer and ones a 6 month old chihuahua mix. However before I got the chihuahua I had a rat terrier, Gracie, that lived to be 15 years old. Everyone in my family was sad to see that dog go including Buddha, my boxer. But after a few months we decided to get the chihuahua mix, Piper. And I'll tell you what I've seen a new energy in Buddha that I haven't seen since he was a puppy. Much more energetic and always playing with Piper. Growing up alongside another small dog he knows not to be too rough with her, but they sure do have a fun together! I love seeing how puppies can bring out the youth in an old dog.
Once I finally own a home, I am going to adopt the oldest dog in the shelter.  I'll be raising my own pups but hopefully their youthful spirit will give the old guy/gal some happiness.  When they pass on, I will go back and get the oldest one again.  Hope to give these seniors a comfortable and inspiring place to retire.  Can't wait!
give your dog a puppy. it is like a PS4 for your dog
Arcanine meets Growlithe <3
That’s actually a senior puppy meets a puppy and starts to feel like a regular puppy himself.  All dogs are puppies!!!
So this is probably not safe for r/aww, butA friend had a 12 year old Newfie that was going through a tough time with Cancer treatments.  Being an old pup and sick he was fairly low energy.One day the Newfie meets my dog , a Shepard/ Chow mix, and you can see the excitement light him up he runs up to greet my dog and then proceeds to try climb up and mount my dog. My dog, a male is confused and not having any of it.I was also horrified seeing 250 pounds of dog move so fast.The Newfie's owner says he normally doesn't do stuff like that, but ocassionally thing for webed paws, which my dog did have. Learn something new every day.
Old dogs and puppies are an adorable combo. We had a female dog of 12 years and introduced a puppy. The old dog was female and the puppy was male. The puppy began pissing like a female dog, having learned it from the old dog. It took a long time after the death of the older dog (who I think died of exhaustion from the puppy) to learn to pee like a male dog.

My god, golden pups are my weakness. Idk what it is about them that gets me all warm and fuzzy inside. I think it’s the eyes? Wait no, maybe the cloudboye cuteness? Idk. Little fuckers.
Is it possible that when an older dog gets excited when seeing a puppy is actually them perceiving they are a puppy as well?
This may sound dumb but the same happens to me when I spend time with my babysitter/nanny and her friends.  I train them at the gym and after awhile, I find myself feeling as young as they are and gossiping and having the same emotions as them.  Maybe I’m reliving my younger 20s days with them or maybe I just enjoy girls that remind me when I was carefree and childless.

In another dimension of reddit: Senior human meets baby and starts to feel like a baby himself.
No joke, I have a 13 year old dog who acts like a puppy because we got another dog that's 2 years old.
Legit teared up at this, it's so cute and a reminder of the joy that dogs can bring to your life.
I had a 10 year old standard poodle named Max who was having seizures almost every week and we were getting extremely worried and began discussing euthanasia with the vet. Shortly thereafter, my friend's golden doodle had a litter of 9 pups and we brought one home and they became best buds. Max never had another seizure for the rest of his life and he lived to 16.

My dog passed away recently and I couldn’t even be there for his final moments... I miss that damn dog 😢

Those tail wags 😍
we got a puppy after one of our dogs died suddenly. our other dog was 11 at the time and really showing it. that puppy easily added a good few years to her life. she’s been gone for a while now and the puppy is getting old fast. going to go hug her extra tight now :)
Every time my dog does something bad I come on Reddit and see something about a senior dog and feel guilty and go play with my pup for an hour or six.
Doggo meets pupper (reddit translation)
When my parents got the dog of our neighbor that passed away, we kept it for a year but because the dog was starting to have trouble with everything so we decided to put the sweet dog down. In the vets office there was a puppy and the dog that could barely see or even stand up anymore started jumping and running around with the puppyIt was a sweet kinda smelly doggy
Damn, my two dogs are grumpy old men who hate youngsters.
Goldens have two life stages.1. Puppy.2. Bigger puppy.
I feel like I wanna cry. This is so pure.
That makes not my day but my entire week great. Wish to see more of this.
So fluffy
Awww my heart!
They're so adorable <3
Cute
The youth keep you young
Just got a new puppy and it seems like our senior dog is jealous on the attention we give to the new one. Even though we treated them equally.

Why do they always smell the genitals?
It's like the equivalent of when older people see babies and they light up.
Oh god this makes my heart hurt BUT smile at the same time.
i wish there was a sub for just senior dogs meeting puppies.. plz reddit
When my dog Sadie died (coming up on 2yr mark) our older dog, who had known her for 6 years, was depressed. Wouldn't leave his bed. We got a 1yr old, super energetic/happy dog. The old man is still crotchety,  but he's been happier with the little one than he ever has been.
I wish i was as brave in real life as that puppy was. He jusr stood his ground with love. Good dog.
Watching this to start 2018. I have a good feeling.
I guess I have to wwatch it a dozen times before I fall asleep
You can take the golden out of the puppy but you can't take the puppy out of a golden.
This is exactly how my dog reacted when my auntie brought up her puppy. Despite having arthritis and a serious heart murmor, he'd be just like this. Miss him every day.
Goldens are the best!
I love the fact that the older dog was the one that initiated the puppy like behaviour. It's so similar to the way some grandfather's play with their young grandson's...
Me as a senior around freshmen.
adorable
Look like a dog dancing like Michael Jackson
I fucking love dogs man.
This saddens me in a way. It’s like a representation of a new life and a life coming to an end.
Kind of feels like when a senior is playing peekaboo with a toddler :-\
Kind of makes me sad, he's thinking "oh shit, they're gonna replace me, I need to step it up...."
Listening to the Colors of the Wind while watching this, awww
That little nose lick at the beginning is just too much man
“Hey I forgot how to do that! Thanks pupper”
What breed is the little dog?
This happens with humans, too. Seeing the joy creep steadily across the face of an old person engaging with a baby.
Whereas my 12 year old Westie doesn't much like puppies.
Same in my case too.I meet a baby, act like a baby :D

I first read this as Señor dog and now the idea of a M A R I A C H I B O Y E is stuck in my head. Thanks, OPama!
And thus the same reason we as humans have kids, they unlock your inner child. - Me 2017/2018
we had our dog Rocky for 14 years. at about 8-9 years old he was in really bad health though. we got a puppy to give him some company and he was like reborn. he finally needed to be put down at 14 but it was much longer than we ever anticipated him making it.
Nice video....goldens are always live like puppies...
When my dog was 9 we got a puppy too, she did the same thing. Suddenly she was many years younger again! Even when we went out, she would start dancing around other dogs if she liked them. It was beautiful to see but alas she passed last year at 16,5 years old. We now have 2 puppies of 3 months, and the 8 year old doesn't have that puppy loving character but once in a while she'll start dancing and the pups get confused.
My family's first dog, Haley, was just 2 when my parents got her from the RSPCA. She had a gammy leg as her previous owners chucked her out of a moving car on the motorway (freeway) and broke her leg, but she was always super active in high spirits. She was a labrador/border collie cross and so her life expectancy wasn't amazing, but when I was 7, we got another labrador puppy from my Uncle and named him Billy. Despite Haley getting on in her age at that point, she was always super active due to Billy's influence and his youth, and she always played and ran around the park with him when we took them on walks. She passed away when she was 15, and then Billy recently passed away at the age of 14 earlier this year in February. Sad times but good memories and I'm glad they got to live as long as they did.
This is great, is there a sub for this kind of thing?
Man i want a dog so bad, but my lifestyle means that it would be unfair on me to get a dog, Why cant someone hire out dogs for weekends to play with and then return them when we go to work during the week?
I wish I had a dog :(
Zoomies are ageless
So cute for that golden oldie:D Spring in the step returns. Very adorable for everyone!!!!
My older dog still acts like a puppy. To the point where I think it’s a brain thing
lil pupper: "I know kung fu"old pupper: "show me"
Love this!!!
This happens with people too
I adopted a puppy the other day (shoutout to all my Chiweenie owners out there) and I can attest to the fact that it is impossible to not feel like a puppy around a puppy.
What a sweet old man! It's amazing how a younger dog can just bring out the puppy in another dog. It really warms my heart.
It's crazy how older dogs will come alive when they see a small pho. For better or worse. My old girl blew both her rear knees out chasing my fiances pug around the backyard. Couldn't afford surgery and my mom almost put her down. She couldn't really walk for several weeks, had to put a towel under her belly and lift her back legs up to take her outside. I convinced her to give her a chance to heal and sure enough she is walking and doing fine, even has to take stairs daily to go outside now.
He stole a small bit of that puppers life force
Y O U N G  A T  H E A R T  B O Y E
That’s adorable
Forever a pup at heart!
all dogs are puppers
My old lab pupper is 13, and he still does this sometimes when confronted with a puppy.
classic romp
Look at this adorableness /u/greenlanternx3
All dogs just want to be puppies.
What good good boys!!
I let out an audible “aww” because AWW.
Like hoomans!
Love it!!!
Let me just smell the weiner first
You're never too old to play with a puppy.
I saved and upvoted this before it could load.
Is this the same dog that got the puppy for Christmas?
Aww
The mini dog is the definition of aww
Reminds me of the scene in willy wonka when his grandfather jumps out of bed and starts dancing.
Well dogs *are* the most well-known example of neoteny
And that's whats up son
he absorbed some of the youth and energy from the pup
When doggie meets doggie))
Where can I rent a golden retriever puppy for an hour and just snuggle and play with it?
I love when old pups meet young ones. I feel like this is the equivalent of when your grandpa sees his grandson. All of a sudden he gets a little more animated and does silly stuff completely out of character for them, but not as cute.
this makes my day
I had a golden with hip dysplasia who didn't give a fuck about it.  He went into golden retriever bucking bronco mode well into his last year.  Good times, good times
I’m always reminded of Air Bud when I see a dog like that. Nostalgia to the max.
Why are videos like this one always of a puppy and senior golden retriever?
I read this like "senor dog" in a Spanish accent.
I wish I had a dog. Just can’t justify leaving it for hours on end everyday though. Seems kind of cruel.
we got a new puppy when our older dog was 10 and as soon as she warmed up to him she was so much more active and enthusiastic
Is there a 10 hour version of this?
Yess I love this, such a message of life and remembering where we came from. Much love
That just saved my day. My week, even! Thank you :)
All dogs are pups no matter how old!
So puppies make everything better for everyone?
looooooollll
I've been watching my dad do the same thing with my son for the past 4 years.
Big boof meets little boof.
Then smells the junk
I love this episode of puppy pals
G E N E R A T I O N  B O I
So cute
Puppy time!!!
We don't deserve dogs
We don’t deserve dogs
This should go on r/TippyTaps
he IS a puppy
That's just B E A UTIFUL
I read this as Señor Dog. I'm really tired.
I initially thought the dog was Spanish.
Cute
I like dogs
Puppy licks are contagious
How happy the puppy is. I really love dog,  but my wife doesn't allow me have one, what to do?
brb drowning in tears
This whole thread makes me happy and sad.
As humans, we don’t fucking deserve dogs. They are tooo good for us.
This is so cute!!!!!! The love!
[removed]
Dogs are the fucking best.
I always feel that happy seeing a new subwoofer.
This same thing happened when I brought my Pit to meet my mom's Rottie.
r/zoomiesYou’re welcome.
Golden labs act like puppies forever.
I'm crying
Nice
I love dogs
I picture the old dog saying: I still got some life left in me youngin'.
He's still got it in him
This is so cute
Too adorable
Anyone know if this is the same dog that got the puppy for Christmas from the front page a few days ago?
Jumpins
All dogs are precious - but why are Goldens especially more so?
We’re all puppies at heart
I love how the little puppy licks the older one at the beginning
My bones ache just watching the olde pup move
Golden Retrievers only have 2 stages in life: smaller puppy and bigger puppy.
I love seeing older dogs acting like puppies!
So precious😍
Awww
Me on the left
I wish I got that happy when I see human puppies.
This is the best. I got a puppy when my oldest pup was 9. I swear he brought her back to life. She's now 12 and he's 3 and she still acts like a puppy because of him.
i love dogs so much
Oh god I just love dogs
Scientific proof that all dogs are puppies. They just change their physical appearance. But they are still PUPPIES
wtf pedophile old dog, disgusting
Dogs never grow up!
First  dog, Jake, came after my cat Baby. He would not take a treat until I gave one to her. Two dogs followed, and the same thing. I have to give food, treats, to EVERYBODY or he won't take one. He barks at the other dogs to come play
Can dogs feel nostalgia?
When my golden retriever was a year old he encountered our neighbor's yorkie who was about 12. The yorkie ended up barking at him and chased him back to our yard. I imagine it as something like an old lady cussing out a teenager for being in her yard
We should love each other as human being.. just like this..
Im gonna cry omg
There is nothing more puppy like or sweeter then an old goldie.
Sometimes I feel like a puppy when I meet a puppy too. I wouldn’t blame the older fella.
adorable
Best thing i’ve seen all day
every animal will act like when they see young ones of their kind
This is so adorable!
Also a benefit you realize after having kids
If only I had a golden....... id see a lot of karma. If only.
That is so awesome
This reminds me of my grandad when he meets kids.
Cute Puppy 😍😍😘😘😘
that is a so sweet story
When my dog was getting old my dad got two little puppies and it rejuvenated my old pup. Definitely helped her get through the last year or so. :( Miss my old pup.
So dang cute!
I like dags
Is that the canine version of talking with overly emphasised emotional cues when addressing a very young child?
Bring in the feels. My childhood best friendnis 16, lives with my mom and dad. When i was in college i got a pup of my own. Shes now 5. Watching the senior dog and my kuch younger pup go after the laser light today brough back all the memories, im so unready for him to go.
Probably cutest thing I've ever seen in my entire life up until this moment
This is the equivalent to baby talk by senior humans when they meet other human's babies.
Hooray!
I hope that ppl who can will consider giving their single dog a companion.  Just like ppl they usually enjoy a friend
I got a younger cat to be a friend for my old man kitty. They play together so much and I’m hoping it makes it easier when he goes, but he’s my best friend and I’ve had him since I was a kid. Animals tear me up.
This is sooo precious... makes me miss my dog. It’s been a year without her and it hurts to look at other dogs. She acted just like this.
ಥ_ಥ so beautiful
*senior puppy meets a young puppy and starts to feel like a young puppyAHEM*
I wish cats were like this instead of hissing at each other for days until they finally get along.
Is this the same pup gifted to the older one on Christmas?
U/CaptHotPotato
That’s a golden oldie
Cute as hell
Big Fluffy And Lil Fuzzy.
In every dog a little puppy is inside
"How do you do, fellow puppies?"
Is this the same dog that got the puppy for Christmas?
I need a puppy in my life....
love it
I love dogs period.
I don't think dogs go past the puppy stage ever though.
My older dog still acts like a puppy. To the point where I think it’s a brain thing
"Lemme smell yooo diiick"
😍😍
So Cute!!!I wish my mom let me have dogs.
cute love
Can we get r/olddogsfeelingyoung rolling already? We all want it.
Lovely
This makes me wish I'd gotten a puppy before my almost 14 year old lab passed away. Now I'm crying.
I once had a beautiful puppy cuter than a japanese baby hamster farm. I named him "Chimmy" because my very young nephew's first word was "chimney" except he said it like    "chimmy". Anyway, I remember it was around the first week that I got him that I decided I would take him to the park and let him roam around a bit. He frollicked like a good boy and women and children all startwd taking pictures so i did find out how much of a babe magnet puppies can be. So one of the girls has her own dog with her, an older labrador, and she asks if chimmy wants to play with "Corporal". I of course say yes amd they begin playing. But then i get a weird feeling in my stomach so i take out a pen thats in my pocket and stab myself in the eye. Blood is gushing everywhere and getting all over the puppies fur. Everyone is screaming but i just laugh and tell them my name is Peter Mondragon. What a fun day.
My 12 year old chap did this the other day. We was absolutely knackered after meeting the puppy and plodded home after that
Damn....these comments have me sad.
awee so cute...golden retriver love😍😍😍😍https://www.tiny4k.in
Best thing that happened to my older dog in a long time was getting a puppy, she was much more active and happy
Fuck me that just melts your heart. I've got to go hug my Golden for a while now.
Very cute! Puppies definitely bring out the playfulness in older dogs! My family had an older Dachshund (around 10-11) and we got a puppy dachshund. The older dog Roxy and the puppy would chase each other around the living playing.
He's just playing game with the kid to keep him entertained.
I needed that. Thank you :]
Made my day
Senior Dog: " I have found you my successor! Thank the heavens!"
I have a 13 year old seniors dog and THANK YOU for sharing this.I won’t get a new dog but I will keep my Bella close to puppies to help keep her young. Thank you!
Such happy tail wags.
I love seeing this. I have a yellow lab named Molly that I grew up with who is still loving life over at my parents house. They thought she wasn’t going to be around much longer; though I disagreed with that, they got a puppy chocolate lab and I had never seen Molly so ecstatic and happy it was like a second wind. Definitely added some years to her life I would say:)
I have a 13 year old dachshund. He normally moves around slowly and gingerly and sleeps a lot. But when he comes across another dachshund, he momentarily turns back into a puppy. It is so sweet.
Dogs are just the best.
Cuteness Overloaded! :D
This happened when my grandparents got there last dog, their eldest at the time got so excited that little puppy Molly got scared and hid in a corner. After that Lasy the older dog hated her till she died.
After all there is some good left on this planet.
awwww
If this were any longer you'd see the older dog sitting down to take a rest. Oh wait, that's just me when i play with my kids for 10 seconds.
All I see are two puppies.
Roses are redBB-8 is roundIt's over, AnakinI have the high ground﻿
This must be the equivalent of adults using "baby talk"!
I foster dogs so had two puppies for three weeks.  My dogs were terrified of them!  Lol.  Of course, if they were going to be my pets, I would have worked to acclimated them.
aren't dogs supposed to smell each other's ass when greeting?
My girl and the pit my next door neighbors have are just the same way!! She’s a rescue that’s been scared of dogs since I got her and he’s definitely starting to show his age, but get them outside together and they’re running and jumping around like they’re both about 5 months old.It’s one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen.
Animals never seem to grow up. Just takes more effort for them to do what they've always done. I've got a lab probably in the dog equivalent of his fifties / sixties and he always acts extra playful around puppies at the park
Might be old, but still a puppy at heart.
I’m listening to a depressing blackened ambient folk song while watching this and it’s bizarre.
Who gives gold to Natsdorf? Are they stupid?
This doggo is showing  exactly what being a grandparent is like. You get to act like a goofy kid again.
this is like a fluffy pokemon battle. i love it.
Gotta' love the cute tweaky and jumpy kiddo puppers, the lil' puppers bring out the kid pup' in everyone and everything it socializes with!
Nothing teaches you how to dog like teaching another dog how to dog
It's our Boston Terriers 12th birthday today and she still gets like this around puppies sometimes, even with only 3 legs
We keep two dogs.Everytime the elder passes away we wait about a year before getting another puppy. They are staggered about 6-7 years so the elder doggo gets a playmate tight at the age they tend to get lazy.
I'm not crying, you're crying!
my heart...
This is so cute I'm crying
r/goldenretrievers
Read that as señor.
I’m in love
Was it Nietzsche that said:-**A man’s maturity: that is to have rediscovered the seriousness he possessed as a child at play**Just change that for Dog, yo!
"I remember bark in my day..."
For some reason, I read it as Señor Dog.
Kudos to the teacher who made this happen.  Good lesson in humanity :)
I love how equally happy the kids are to be singing in sign for him.
Good thing we have a janitor here to mop up my tears  😭 😭 😭
Videos of kids being kind to custodians will never get old.
That's some wholesome shizz right there.
Right in the feels...
Just realised that deaf is the perfect way to be if you work in a school.
This is really beautiful. It’s great to see custodians being acknowledged and celebrated. In my experience custodians at schools get treated so much better than in other place but I’m sure that’s not true everywhere. My dad worked as a custodian when I was growing up for a subsidized elderly apartment building. Despite him being incredibly nice to the residents (all residents had his personal phone number and could call him at any time day or night for their clogged toilet or leaky pipe, hell he went out there are 2am because a resident said their door closed “too loudly”.) yet they treated him like garbage. One summer I worked as a custodian for a large manufacturing plant. Everyone I saw would tell me I needed to do a better job cleaning their cubicle, or I missed a spot over in x, even though it was just two of us cleaning a gigantic building and had cycles of what we cleaned on what days based on what the person in charge at the company wanted. Despite explaining this to them, they would continue to point out “mistakes” everyday. Please appreciate what custodians do and give them respect. The jobs has its moments, but is never a great time. Feeling respected and appreciated goes a long way.
I wish the camera had been better positioned but this is awesome!  I am deaf and think this is wonderful.
No sound on the video, couldn't hear them.
Oh man, I had an awesome custodian when I was in elementary school!! This just reminded me!His name was Michael (don't remember his last name), and he was somewhat old. He always used to yell "If you recycle, you can call me Michael!" He was like the only guy that reminded us to use the recycling bins. And if he ever caught you cleaning something up, he'd give you some jolly ranchers.Didn't realize how cool of a dude he was until just now.
I did the exact same thing he did when I saw the kids signing. This is just so cute!!!
This was his 60th birthday and he has been working in the school system for more than 20 years.  You don't need sound to understand the love on display here.
I'm not crying .. that's pee. Eye pee. I have a disease. Not important
What a great teacher
Fucking stop it with the custodian love reddit! My heart can't take this much fucking wholesomeness!
The out of sync signing perfectly simulates how twenty out of sync kindergarteners would have sang it.
i may not hear the world like you,but i can see your face,n everything you say is truei 'hear' it in a placethat isn't how most people hear,i use a different partmy friends, i may not use my ears -i hear you with my heart
There is still hope for this world
We had an awesome Custodian through my whole elementary school time.I think one of the reasons kids always have this connection to custodians is that they're one of the only adults in the school who aren't trying to boss you around or who have authority over you, so they kinda become friends, like you're in it together.
Amazing.
GaNg oF wHitE kiDs brUtalLy make blaCk CustOdiAn crY
These videos always make me think about times i’ve missed out on doing something good like this just because i didn’t think of it
As a fire alarm service tech I talk to a lot of school custodian and facility staff let me tell you, these men and women are usually some of society’s nicest, down to earth people you can meet. I swear I never get a warmer greeting from anyone else then I do from these people.
One of the Custodians at my wife's elementary school is deaf and reads lips very well. He LOVES when our toddler is with her at school because we taught him very basic sign language from infancy. They really do have a bond that we can't understand.
Between this and the foster dad post I am quite dehydrated
this just made my day a whole lot better
No sound needed. I’m definitely crying.
I’m too proud to admit I tried turning my volume up...
the boy in the red is bullshitting his way through it
They made his ~~day~~ life.
I was...somebody is chopping some onions...whatever, here's my upvote.
My dumbass tried turning the volume up
Faith in humanity.
Good way to start the morning. ❤️
I guess that after reading many comments on this post, my comment would be...How about be nice to everyone. Treat people the way you want to be treated.We never know what is going on in another human beings’ mind. We don’t know what kind of trouble they are in or what terrible news they received or whatever it is that makes them act in an “unfriendly “ way.A smile and a word of encouragement will go a loooooooong way.I have to challenge all of you here who has someone in you workplace who’s a sour puss or jus an unfriendly person. Try to change it by changing your attitude and approach. It may take a while but when you really try and put the effort in, you’ll be amazed what you can do with just being kind and approach someone without prejudice and no preconditions.Treat others the way you want to be treated and you’ll see what a wonderful world you make this world become.Peace ✌️
My elementary school janitor's name was Mr Manuel, and he was a friggin awesome dude. Each monthly assembly he would present the cleanest Graderoom with the Golden Garbage Can award... legit just a garbage can spray painted gold lmao. But I'll never forget him.
I LOST it watching this last night. I’m a teacher and in undergrad several of my professors made sure to emphasize how important it is to have a good relationship with the school secretary and the building custodian. I make sure at the end of my Friday’s to go shoot the shit with the custodian in the boiler room. My mom is a school secretary so I already knew to be nice to those.
This hits home. My mom is a custodian at a school and from what ive seen, they love her there. And she deserves every bit of it. She stays past what she is paid and goes above and beyond every day. She deserves the same love when she gets home. But that doesnt always happen. Shes always so happy when she brings back pictures of her favorite kids and teachers or when they give her things.Firmly believe its gestures like this that make the job worth it.
If this doesn’t warm your heart, then you are a cold bastard.
This made me realize that sign language should be taught in school. Not necessarily a ton  of it, but definitely enough that everyone can communicate the necessities regardless of whether they can hear or not.
Back in school we all respected our custodians, to the point where the one time some students tried to bully and mess with them the whole school went on alert to stop it.
I'm curled up in a ball. Puking my guts out. Moving hurts like a goddamn volcano up my ass. But this..this is good
Absolutely beautiful!!!!!😍😍😍😘
Holy crap, this is the cutest god damn thing ever.
"This looks cute! \*puts on headphones to hear it\*"I'm an idiot.
Poor guys knee looks jacked up
Hes gonna remember that for the rest of his life
I think this is wonderful! People don’t realize how important our school custodial staff does everyday. They are the ones that keep the schools running! Way to go kids! He really deserves it! 😊
What is this wetness around my eyes? The fuck?
This just totally made my day!
wow!
Oh... well I'm gonna cry.
Wholesome af
Why people aren’t kind to custodians is just beyond me.  This is how I judge how people truly are.
Videos like this make my heart melt.
The old man rub face beard thing gets me right in the feels every time.
This custodian appreciation thing is wonderful, please keep it up.
I tried to turn my volume up to listen to this. Didn't really think that through...
Sound doesn’t work on video /s.
Tried to increase volume then remembered the title, feeling like an asshole now.
SERIOUS: Is it still calling singing in sign language?
NO, You are crying!
I read half the title and started watching and was like, "I wonder if I could turn on the sound for this, it looks adorable."Then I read the other half
Still wish the video had audio..
Who put this bowl of onions here 😭😭That gave me all the feels!
now this is cool! more of this, less of the crap in the news!
Did I just try and turn up the volume on a sign language video?
I can’t hear it..
There's no sound!
this is wonderful...love still seeing signs of decent humanity. :)
Ok, but who was singing the loudest?
Wish this video had sound.... ohhhh.
What a wonderful gesture! Kudos to the teachers for teaching them how to sign and to acknowledge him in that way!  For all those asking for sound....  He’s deaf!  Try listening with your heart and your eyes..... from his perspective. To him there wasn’t any sound.
I tried to turn the volume up but I forgot they were signing fml
This shit made my eyes fog up.
At first I was disappointed there was no sound. Then I realized this is the most authentic experience.
Why is there no sound?
This just totally made my day!
The teacher is the real mvp here.
Then the janitor laid down some pipes on the teacher for good measure
Thanks I’m sobbing at work now
Custodians were always the nicest people. As long as I was nice to them, they’d help me out more than most teachers would
First post I look at today, aaaaand I'm crying.
Needs a repost on r/humansbeingbros
This is the sweetest thing ever
Props to the teacher to taking class time to do this. Teaching kids another language is difficult, and she used it to teach them another lesson on appreciating those around us. Bravo!
Why the fuck don't we pay teachers more?!?!!!?!?!!!!
I like this new trend of custodian appreciation
Lovely 😊 I love seeing schools appreciating their custodians.
Can we make this whole making custodians feel amazing a daily thing?
I'm not teasing the guy but I walk like that after sitting on the toilet too long on reddit.
This reminded me that I still have a heart.
Sign language is truly amazing <3
Ok, how many of you instantly tried to turn the volume up?! I need to know I'm not alone!
I love that one kid who was just circling his arms in front of him the whole time.
Is there a version with sound?
This video needs sound
Was gonna ask for video with audio then I realized....
I tried to put the sound on.... to hear the singing..... ... .
Does he have a messed up knee/leg/back, or is he just doing a dramatic falling walk like you might do when you’re taken back by the magic of the situation?
Love this! I work for the school board and there’s no one besides the principal I respect more than the custodial staff... if I see kids purposely making a mess, I make them clean it up and give them a lecture on how hard the custodians work for them and me. It’s a thankless job and no one knows how much work or hours they actually do.
am i the only dumbass that turned up my volume expecting to hear something
That really made my day, and it's only 9am
I want a sub specifically for people being wholesome to custodians
Custodians don’t get enough love. Good job kids, faith in humanity restored.
Once when I was complaining about mowing lawns my mom told me, “There’s no job which you’re too good to do.” At first, I took it as a slight. But now that I’m older, I really appreciate her saying it and I try my best to remember it.
Made my day thank you, there is still good in the world. Just a little bit sometimes is huge.
r/MadeMeSmile
This is awesome. I supervise construction. I had one def carpenter working on my site out of 200 + workers. He communicated with everyone only through text and note pads. I took the time to learn and teach my team to say good morning and good night when we saw him. He was so excited the first morning I used it he started signing me and I had to explain I don’t know sign I just learned for him. We are still friends.
I wish I could upvote this a million times!
School custodians are just the best people somehow.  They deserve so much more than we give them for the work they do and the things they put up with - and always with a smile.
Can we get a link with sound ffs...
I'm dumb. Checking my volume cause I didn't hear anything
I'm not crying, you're crying.
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😢
Too early for chopping onions in here.  /sniff
\-My hands so hurt...\-Why?\-I've been singing all night!
I love how much fun the teacher looks like she’s having while she’s signing with them! I love how much fun everyone looks like they’re having! My morning started out so shitty, I’m so glad this vid was the first thing I saw when I opened reddit.
I’m really dumb I turned this up expecting there to be volume
My heart.
Yes, yes, this is great. But: Is this a StarWars shirt?
This is so great. That teacher is thoughtful. The kids learned more than just sign language.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Learning the best lessons early!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
These kids touched this guys heart for life!
I have something in my eye. I'm not tearing up!
Why did I turn my volume up
My son is taking ASL as his foreign language in high school. I hope so much that he has the opportunity to make someone happy with his knowledge.  Loved seeing this today😁
wow
This!! And more of this kind of stuff, throughout the world. I need it, so I don’t loose hope in mankind. Thanks OP :)
It’s nice to be important. But it’s more important to be NICE.
r/mademesmile
This was lovely
Isn't this same custodian we saw in the gym last week?
Is Teacher wearing \_leggings\_?
Videos of people crying for joy will never get old. I love these.
That’s amazing he must be really proud them after that.
I’m crying
Oh...my heart. Why does it feel stretched to breaking and then full to overflowing at the same time? I love this feeling.  What a sweet thing to do. ❤️
Always remember to be nice to custodians! When I was a sophomore dorming in college we had a "floor meeting" and I suggested, hey, we should give the janitor a thank you card for all he's done for us. Well, the RA looked at me like "uh, okay..." and honestly the weird reaction from her and her assistant made me back off. I feel bad I never thanked him, but I got so self-conscious about my suggestion. I thought, maybe that isn't really a thing these people do. I mean, I grew up with my mom tipping the mailperson at Christmas, so I figured being appreciative was normal.
Who’s chopping onions??
I wondered why there was no sound at first but then i realised it
More wholesome than wholesome!
I thought it said "sids king" at first
I’m not crying...It’s just been rainin’, on my face.
Well done kids! It is very well thought out!
This the kinda shit that makes you cry on your period
One of my happiest memories from elementary school was giving my janitor a box of Oreos for winter break. You could tell he was so happy 😁.
Does he have a feather duster?  There appears to be a lot ...sniff ... of dust ... sniff ... in here. *reaches for tissue*
I remember if fourth grade we had a janitor named Martin. He was a hispanic man who couldn’t really speak english all that well. Anyways every time we would have an assembly in the gym Martin would always be on the stage doing a final sweep of the floor. Me and my friends just started chanting Martin, Martin, Martin and eventually most of the gym joined in and this continued every time he would appear on stage and you could see his eyes light up and he couldn’t contain his smile anymore. Martin if your reading, your the fucking man.
Eyebleach
Where's the sound?
Jannitor in a video : instant upvote
My. Freaking. Heart.
Who brought onions?
This made me cry. Such genuine happiness. Don’t feel like I see these kinds of things enough these days.
I’m stone cold and eyes did not water at all.
If I ever have kids I hope to God that they have teachers like these two. I don't have clear memories of math or science or reading lessons from elementary school, but I can clearly recall the lessons I was taught about being kind to others.
The sweetest thing ever
I FREAKING LOVE VIDEOS ABOUT APPRECIATING JANITORS 😭😂💕
Ok, this is fucking adorable! :')
Well that's wholesome.
this was a great way to start my day. thank you
my stupid ass was trying to find the volume control to turn it up
I'm not crying your crying!
I'm not crying, it's just been raining, on my face.
Aww
Make me cry at work...
Yay!! So wonderful!! So mamy ways!!!
This reminds me of my elementary school janitor, a Vietnam veteran. The whole whole school lined up and cheered on his last day of work there.
Instant tears. To see children learning sign language is something, but see them put it to such compassionate use is tear jerking
Expected to 'hear' the kids singing for a moment, and then realized, wait it's exactly what the custodian would have experienced.
We need more of these kinds of thing in the news!! That guy looks legit thrilled about this!
I wanna fuckin cry fam...
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
I'm not fucking crying, YOURE CRYINGGG
Yo that’s wholesome as fuck
No shit here, it made my eyes wet.How sweet.
It warms my heart to see the expression in the man's face.&#x200B;
My dad is a custodian too and he loves his job, it's great seeing this. 🥰
These never fail to make me happy. What wonderful teachers these ladies are!
His reaction!! Genuine surprise and appreciation! I love these videos
We don’t deserve custodians 😭😭😭😭
❤️❤️❤️ beautiful
This actually made me start crying. This is one of the best things I've EVER seen on this subreddit.
[deleted]
I cant hear anything bro
Reddit needed this today.
MY HEARTmy emotions
Why cant the news show this as much as they show the hate and anger they want you to see?The fact that this made me tear up is sad. This should make me so happy, it did, but I wish I could feel that more often. I'm tired of being angry.
Those are some awesome teachers.
Unpopular opinion here, but isn't it sort of demeaning to be OVERLY nice to a custodian? It almost feels as if you are pitying them. Don't get me wrong, you should always be kind and considerate to anyone regardless of their position but all of this over the top custodian worship strikes me as sort of bizarre.
Me: I’ll just have a quick peek at reddit during my downtime at work Boss: what’s wrong?? Why are you crying!
Can we get it with sound?
Really?!? Isn't it a little early to choke me up with somerhing like this?
As the son of a retired Janitor, that would've made his year.
The sound isn't working. :/
I feel that two things are inevitable in elementary school: Someone smears shit on the bathroom wall and everyone loves the custodian.
IF YOU DONT THANK YOUR ~~BUS DRIVER~~ CUSTODIAN YOURE A RACIST
**Awwwww, how nice. That's sweet.**
Why do people never post the video with sound
Is there sound for this?
Why is there no sound?
Imma cry famz
Stop making my allergies make my eyes water up, you bastards.
nah im not crying, one of the kids must be cutting onions or something.
I read the title, then immediately paused the video to try and turn the sound on.Ill be ok...
My father is a lead custodian and has the kindest heart of anyone I know! He works at an elementary school and takes his job seriously for the well-being of the students and staff. He never judges a soul, but he also never allows bullying or disrespect of any kind. He loves interacting with the kiddos, and each year he looks forward to surprising his co-workers with Christmas gifts. He expects nothing in return for his kindness. He does his work thoroughly, enjoys getting top-scores on all of his inspections, and spends plenty of time outside of work with my special needs brother and disabled mother. I adored having my father with me during my elementary school years. I saw him as a protector, and he was always super nice to my friends and classmates too.  I still adore him now that he's ready for retirement. I don't think he will ever lose his dedication and determination to his work!
Can someone find me the one with sound
Videos of people shedding tears of joy or being genuinely touched by the kindness of others is my favorite thing in the internet.
We had a custodian at my elementary school that was an amazing guy. He was nice as hell and all the kids loved him. One day our teacher was being a butch so he made a bs excuse to get us out early and gave us chocolate milk and cookies and sat and talked with us about it. He died in a car accident a few weeks later and literally the whole school cried. Rip Mr. Ray
Why doesn't the gif have sound I can't understand what they're saying
I’m not crying, you’re crying! ❤️😂❤️😂
Singing HBD to custodians is a much better trend to see go viral than trying to dance outside your moving car or waiting in a corn field dressed as a clown to scare people.
This makes me smile. When I was in elementary school, like k-4th I would leave treats for the custodian who cleaned our classrooms, especially around holidays. Custodians are underappreciated, especially the ones that work in schools!
It’d be better with audio...Yes I know I’m going to hell.However this strange liquid started to come out of my eyes around the second loop.
Fuck i feel awful. First thing i asked was “wheres the sound” until i properly read the title again
Cuts onions in sign language
its existed for 8 hours and already has top gliding on r/aww, wow.also very fitting that the GIF is silent.
I'm not crying! You're crying!
Turned the volume all the way up then realized the grave mistake I made Oops!
Where's the sound?
It always makes me so happy to see schools doing nice things for janitors, and then seeing the janitor happy
Treating people like human beings, always the best way! Best teacher! 👐👐👐
I can't hear anything!  Can you please re-upload with sound!
I can’t get the audio to work
I love that even singing it in sign language Happy Birthday is hard for everyone to get in sync.  Universal experiences no matter what your background or language make humankind a beautiful thing.
No volume?
OMG ! So Amazing the kids were looking happy !
That guy has a hell of a limp.
Who left this bowl of onions here?
This is amazing, great to see first thing in the morning :)
A sister making a brother happy, I can dig that
This is so beautiful
That's awesome. And I hope they continue to treat their custodian with the same kindness as they grow up.
Hit me right in the feels first thing in the morning!
Oh man I’m sobbing now this is so sweet
tears in my eyes love it.
My heart
Giving me all the feels this morning
Too sweet!
Fucj I almost cried
His reaction makes me so happy
One of the kids accidentaly put the school on fire due to flame justsu
Why no sound?
This is a pure and beautiful thing.
I always thought it was just my schools where the custodians were awesome people that deserved this kind of stuff. I love seeing shit like this.
It’s fitting there’s no sound.
This is beautiful :)
This is one of the nicest things I have seen all this week.
This is a pure and beautiful thing.
It’s too early in the morning to be tearing up at my desk.
why are my eyes sweating
This is beautiful
I laughed because the video has no sound.
Jesus, just be nice to people who deal with you, what you consume or what you throw away. How hard is that?
That head grab says it all
This is that kind of good shit I needed on a crappy morning.
Is that really considered singing, or just aggressive signing.
this video is so sad :(
Here, have my awwpvote
How are they gonna top this one? Are kids going to do some sky writing for their janitor next time?
I have a cold. I just woke up. I WASN'T READY 😭😭😭😭
No sound? /s
These kids half assed it.... Still wholesome af
How does this not have more upvotes?!
This is so precious
This is the sweetest thing ever!
This was the best post to wake up to this morning
Someone get these damn onions out of here!!!
Probably thought he was coming in to the class to clean up sick or wee and then gets a surprise like that
Why did I expect sound wth
This is so heart warming <3
children will always bring a smile to our faces no matter the situation. I love what am seeing.
A little bit hope for humanity has been restored
Custodians dont ever get the credit they deserve. This is very heart warming.
We had a housekeeper in my dorm in college. Lois was a sweet elderly lady, and my suitemate and I would tap dance for her. She loved it, loved us, and we loved her. One of my happiest memories of college.
The feels are strong with this one.
Wow!
I was like „this is probably way better with sound“...
This man looks like one of the sweetest custodians, he deserves this.
Did anyone else try to see if there was sound and then feel like an idiot?
As a custodian, I love this! It’s a thankless job but a moment like this makes all the crap (literal and figurative) worth it
r/wholesome
Where's the sound to this gif? Oh wait ...
I never thought I'd see anything from where I live on here! That's hickerson elementary in Coffee County.
Yes!! More janitor appreciation posts!!
Some of the singing is a little pitchy. But coming from kids, that makes it even cuter. Aaaawwwww....
This is the new grandpa’s and dad’s crying over gifts trend. Totally fine with both trends coexisting in harmony.
This the shit i live for
Why can't I hear the sound
When did the kids learn sign language
Tears-of-joy jutsu
His reaction is absolutely priceless!
Me and one of the custodians at my school are both metalheads, so he always asks me what I’m listening to. And since I usually sit alone at lunch he frequently talks to me about music/movies/video games and he seems like a really cool dude.
I was expecting sound, but it makes more sense this way.
I can't hear what they're singing
All the feels
I often think I wish I could see the custodian from the small school I went to from 1st to 5th grades.  His name was Mitch and he was the nicest old black man you could EVER meet.  He gave the best hugs and I wish I could have another 35 years later.  There was only one class per grade and he knew us all.
Very heartwarming
In middle school I had this janitor named Mr. Stapleton. He was kind of big and gruff but also really nice. I'd always say hi to him coming into school and he'd always call me "little man." Don't know why but it always made my day a little bit.
This is the smile I TOTALLY NEEDED this morning.  I'm actually tearing up, watching his reaction.  Thanks for posting.
Every viral tweet i see on twitter ends up on reddit after  few hours.
Our high school janitor got some gifts from our school and a deafening, earth-shattering cheer/applause on her last day before she retired. Felt like one of those "where were you?" moments around our school.Margaret you're awesome.
Great. Now my boss wants to have a private meeting about why I'm crying at work.
A very caring act of humanity
I was set up selling antiques at an outdoor show at Jack London Square in Oakland in the 90s.Behind my set-up was this little mini-bandstand... with enough room for maybe three guys or a barbershop quartet,  a permanent fixture (at the time anyway)I hear something going on behind me, I turn and see that there are about a dozen little kids on the bandstand, their parents sitting in folding chairs, and some music comes on.&#x200B;It's R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly." The kids stand there swaying and signing to it, the parents faces are beaming... I watch for a moment, and the realize I have to quickly duck into the men's room around the corner so nobody will see me burst into tears.&#x200B;Little kids, man. Little deaf kids getting support and love from proud happy parents... my own childhood was the total opposite, could not possibly be more opposite, maybe that has something to do with my reaction, but man... &#x200B;I STILL get choked up when I hear that song because of that day... that stupid, cloying, horrible cheesy song... I see those parents and kids.
1. Try not to cry2. cry an awful lot
They did an awful job
Made my fucking day.
And I was annoyed because I couldn't fine the volume/sound button...
My volume isn’t working
Can we get one with sound?
Oh my god that’s so beautiful!
I was wondering why there was no sound, but...
I love happy people
we heard it was your birthday
At my middle school the head custodian was a treasure. He remembered all of our names and was super sweet. And in high school we had lunch lady appreciation day. Everyone deserves recognition!
Now this makes me hopeful
That's actually amazing
Too bad it’s a gif so I couldn’t hear the singing
This made my day :)
Where is the sound?
/r/WatchPeopleLiveInside ?
Such a small, thoughtful act of kindness that will have such a positive impact on that janitor and the kids.
Kids are wonderful makes you smile and cry at the same time Beautiful
heartwarming
Wow, no audio?
More please
That’s beautiful! These Kids are great... Glad they made his birthday a happily memorable one
My heart
r/mademesmile
Oh yea this totally made my day. Just what I needed
One of the nicest videos I've seen in quite some time. Thank you for sharing.
Willy doesn’t hear ya. Willy still cares.
I love this!  I remember the custodian at my elementary school, Mr Jimmy.  Us kids treated him like a rock star and he may as well have been.  He was the nicest, funniest people I've met.  He loved all of us kids and went above and beyond every day. Thanks, Mr Jimmy.
Reddit you gotta stop making me cry this nearly dog
Great on so many levels.
Reddit you gotta stop making me cry this early dog
not sure why i felt the need to turn the volume up
There is goodness in this world.
WHY ARE MY EYES LEAKING
When he puts his hands on his head, such pure happiness
The people who have overcome the greatest hurdles take the most joy out of life
Turn the Volume up ay
I needed this 🙏🏾🙏🏾
my heart ♥️
Aww
I guess it's fitting that this video doesn't have sound. Makes for a really immersive experience.
It's interesting to see just the change in posture.  He obviously has issues with his leg, and his posture probably suffers from it....but the moment he sees those kids, he stands up straight, smiling.  It's like he was 20 years younger for a moment.  Truly a special moment.
What an awesome thing to do, takes like 2 mins yet it will become a lifelong memory. That’s dope.
This is the beauty of what small gestures mean to someone. Hats off to the teacher and students for doing this!
My elementary school’s custodian worked there for 20 years at the least. He was so cool. Wore leather jacket, rode his motorcycle every day, had a mullet, mustache, and still looked classy. He also gave great advice and always took time to console a crying or hurt kid. I went back there when my half brother started school and he was still there 20 years later! Gave him a hug and thanked him for the all the love he put into his work and care for the kids.
Something to the effect of "your worth is not judged you by the way you treat the people that you serve, it's judged by the way that you treat the people who serve you"
One of the most important rules for a teacher to follow is to be nice to the custodial/janitorial staff. Invite them to your holiday parties. Hook them up with snacks. Treat them with respect. If you do, they will take good care of you. If you don’t, don’t expect them to go that extra mile for you.
Um it’s not even 10am and I’m already crying
Didn’t have to play the video. Already getting feels.
Awesome!
Shit, I should probably know the Birthday of my cleaning people.
My elementary school janitor at Rohr Elementary School 1970's was Mr Dempsey. He was a nice Grandpa type, WWII vet and I would bring him treats when my mom baked. Thank you Mr Dempsey!
this is wonderful...love still seeing signs of decent humanity. :)
Being loved and appreciated by children might be the most pure unfiltered love there is.
Love how some of the kids are like me trying to do YMCA:IT'S GOOD TO BE A THE [something, something, wave hands around randomly]... A!!!
I crye
There's hope for humanity yet. Things like this make me sure of it.
heart-warming; kudos to the teacher and those great kids
Do they teach SL in all schools? I was taught SL at school.
No sound on this video. Can you re-upload?
I love it
Thank you for that
But I can't hear them sing.. Oh.
Thank you OP for calling them Custodians. My mother was one and when some student asked for a 'Janitor' she would say "there are no Janitors. I don't know if you'll find any Janitors around here."
Awww so sweet.
Cryin
Holyshit the world is beautiful!!!
This could be a very beautiful moment in a film.
tath is awesome
What is this wetness around my eyes? The fuck?
This made my decade
Custodians are unsung heroes.
Video with sound??
What seems to be the problem with custodian's walking ?
Where's the volume?
Ah man, I remember my janitor from elementary school. Every kid thought he was the coolest
Fuck i love these videos. I remember when I was a freshman my school was teying to move Larry, this really cool janitor to another school so we all signed a petition to keep him so he stayed! He was so happy.
Reminds me of the comic where one parent says to do well in school or be a janitor; the other parent says do well in school and make the world better for them.The first thing I do when I take a teaching position is find custodial and office staff and get to know them. They deserve respect and have secret powers--like the power to fast-track requests.
This is awesome!!
I can't keep crying at the office with this videos...
In a world that sometimes seems filled with monsters and evil, it's good to remember that there are teachers, kids with kind hearts, and others, who will reach out and make sure everyone feels love and gets included in the community.
thank you op for blessing us this morning
What I would give to have the silent Happy Birthday song go mainstream.  It almost makes it bearable for everyone.
Ima cry this is so cute
My heart is so warm now
First thing I saw when I opened up Reddit today. Truly started my day with wholesomeness, thank you
This is a fantastic lesson to teach kids. Appreciate and respect those who work for you and/or work to make your lives better.
I thought he was wearing a fake taxi tshirt
This is the most heartwarming video, I have ever seen. Made my day. <3
Reminds me of Fonzie on Happy Days, learning how to sing Happy Birthday to his hard of hearing girlfriend, and Richie teaches him some ASL![Happy Born Day To You!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGHwtVCqSwc) - Henry Winkler, master of his craft.
I hope “make grand gestures to your custodian” is the new “thank your bus driver”.
A grown man cries.
Aww, I bet his whole day just shined after that.
I adore this. Thanks for sharing!
Is there a link with sound for this?
This is the sweetest thing.
gonna need audio so i can cry my eyeballs out&#x200B;
I cannottt!!! So beautiful! Things like this makes me so damn happy
Would better with sound.
This would be better with audio.
My faith in humanity has been restored for another day😊
My heart....
This brings tears to my eyes, so sweet
I put my headphones on to hear the sound...
This is just beautiful
This Is The Best Video Ever
Dam I thought the video was going to have sound.
By hit gait and left hand, wondering does he have Cerebral Palsy or had a stroke as well?
I needed this today. 💖
me: why is there no sound?me: ...me: oh
My dumbass turn up the volume to hear the kids sing in sign language...God I need sleep. But I enjoyed this so there is that.
Am I the only one here who, for a second, was looking for the sound button?...
MAKE HIM CRY!!!! DO IT, CHILDREN!!! DO IT!!!!!
How precious.
Ok, who else thought “oh hey, I can’t hear it”?
How did they sing in sign language?
I put my volume up :( dumbass moments
That is adorable
Bless him
*Deaf
awwesome
r/noisygifs
 this man would be very happy, all those children love him!
Reddit3.13.2.219433 My
In elementary school I always loved the custodian! Mr. Ken! He was THE MAN! I'm not sure why, but all the kids loved him. He was just an average, nice dude but all the students treated him like a hero. One time a bunch of kids put tar all over the playset and I stayed after school to keep him company cleaning it. Mom was really mad because I didn't check in... And got covered in tar. Glad he didn't get in trouble!
This is tier two of thanking the busdriver
This is actually the most precious thing I’ve ever seen.
But why is there no volume?
That probably made this man’s year!
Love this.
Proof that sweetness still exists.
This is the nicest thing I’ve ever seen thanks op
Got shit in my eyes again.
Protect these custodians at all costs
Take my hearttttt omg
si372usvabajajahs822 im fcrying so hardf
We are capable of really beautiful things
Made my day
This is just so awesome... Faith in humanity restored!
Don’t know why i expected this to have sound....
When our custodian drove our band a few hours away (for free, he insisted we didn't pay him) we tried to be nice and my music teacher paid for his hotel room. He paid her back anyway. JUST ACCEPT OUR KINDNESS AND $140!
That's awesome
Needed this today..
Perfect timing to get off reddit. Thanks to pinko. This was absolutely beautiful.
Beautiful
This is beautiful
Love this! Made my day.
Someone once told me to imagine sign language was actually just gang signs and I haven’t been the same since.
Soooo cute!!! Precious!! 😀😀😀😀😀
The asynchronous way they are signing looks like what it would sound like if they were actually singing.
My mom’s a custodian at a highschool and it means the world to them when people do small things like say hi, or acknowledge them. They work so hard moving desks and tables and waxing floors and cleaning the building. Some assholes piss on the floors, shit on the floor, put cans in the toilet and shit on it. People can be real assholes and they’re the unsung heroes of the workplace. So when you see a custodian just say thanks for what they do, you’ll see it means a lot to people like them.
I can make the blood gang sign
This is beautiful
I didn't hear anything.
My highschool had 3 janitors, one of them was my aunt so I got to know them well, they joked that they all preferred to be called custodial engineers, that legitimately made me rethink everything about 'janitors', now I only call them custodial engineers
So sweet!!
Does someone have sound? I can't hear a thing.
Reminds me of our custodian at my elementary school.  "Mac" always had a big smile, never had a cross word to say.  We all adored him but I am sure he is long gone by now.  He brought so much joy to so many kids.
Need the sound fixed on this video, I can't hear anything.
r/mademesmile
[removed]
Wasn’t planning on crying till at least noon but here I am
this is awesome
Anybody got the video with sound?
This is how you make a grown man cry in front of children
What is a custodian? Think they are called something else where I live? (Scotland)
I’m not crying you are! (I actually generated tears watching this)
I was about to turn up the sound in the video... then I remembered.
Best part is most of those kids will always remember how to sign this.
Would have been better if the video had audio.Even subtitles or something.
My father is a custodian and he has worked at several schools and it’s just so wholesome when he gets letters from students thanking him.
Funeral yesterday...wasn't supposed to cry today.  I'll take it, though. =)
Jesus that kid in the back is waaaaaaay off key
Lol his hands on his hips*well I'll be damned*
I'm not crying, you're crying.
This reminds me of the handyman in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. The one who rode a bike everywhere.
AWWWW!! this is so sweet! im really in tears!! God bless them all
I love this! My grandpa was a school janitor and my grandma was a waitress, it’s the people with the thankless jobs who are always the kindest and most hardworking.
My heart... has melted
Everyone deserves being sung to on their birthday!
Version with sound?
I'm not crying you are
I was going to ask for a version with sound, but I realized I don’t think it would actually matter...
This is why I love Reddit. Right in the feels!
A happy and excited custodian usually seems to indicate happy and excited kids and teachers.
Where is the sound?!
What does a custodian do?
This warms my heart.
That's beautiful
w h o l e s o m e
I think it's suitable that this video has no sound
Some of those kids aren't even doing anything lmao and some of the ones that are just haphazardly doing shit with their hands until it's time to point
my god.  This wins the internet today, and my heart.  I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING!
At first i was like “huh, weird that theres no audio” and then i realized
There’s no sound.  Source?
This is the most wholesome shit
This is awesome
My sister just got accepted into a masters program for speech pathology this morning, this is gonna make her day even better.
theres no sound
I'm not crying. You're crying.
It's only 8 in the morning and you've just made me cry most of my daily tears. This video, and the one about the terminally ill babies. Jesus christ reddit, help me save some tears for the rest of my terrible day!
omg stawp!   too early to cry. !!
It's only 8 in the morning and you've just made me cry most of my daily tears. This video, and the one about the terminally ill babies. Jesus christ reddit, help me save some tears for the rest of my day!
I'm browsing reddit drunk and at first glance this looked like they dabbed on him sorry
This is great. I try to get to know everyone's name at work because I don't want them to feel left out or not acknowledged. I mean some of my coworkers don't know the name of the guy (Chris) who empties their trash cans everyday and it's like a pet peeve of mine.
Oh... well I'm gonna cry.
This was so cute :)
This made me smile...
Sound?
That's the good stuff
Ok, but who was singing the loudest?
These kind of videos always bring a tear to my eye.
This is so precious.
As a school caretaker I love all of these videos ! Makes my heart smile.
What an awesome surprise!
This makes me so happy I feel like it’s MY birthday!
Plot twist- janitor never learned sign language! JK, this is truly great to watch and heartwarming af
This makes me feel good
What’s a custodian?
This made water drip out  of. my eyes. My son is hearing impaired. Thank you  sweet teacher and sweet children. You made my day. Karma to you.
Is this the new thank your bus driver
Growing up in a deaf household these type of videos always get to me... good on this teacher.
No audio? Oh wait...Great video, stuff like this makes me happy<3 and I hope these kids will keep thanking custodians and other works because they deserve recognition :D
This restores my faith in the world!!
This is so sweet Arduno play despacito,Actually plays Megalavania like a bossNooo!!
Why didn't you upload a video with sound?
This is beautiful
Now this is wholesome.
God, kindness is such a wonderful thing.  I feel so bad for all those people who live day to day with hate, fear and animosity in their hearts.
A video. https://youtu.be/bvWaYMgmWooI just picked one I didn't check who uploaded it first. Thought you'd guys enjoy sound.
I hate it when people don't upload videos with the sound on
What a nice thing to wake up too! Love it
During Jr High and High school, I had the honor to know school custodian's who sort of doubled as psych counselors and generally good advisors on how to live in the real world.  The door to the 'janitor closet' was always open, and there was always and empty chair and a willing ear.  And sometimes a bucket of the nasty stuff used to clean up puke too.
Where's the audio?
That's awesome.Bet that made his day.
Things I've learned since high school. Always make friends with the janitorial staff, it becomes a mutually beneficial relationship that will save both your butts more times then you care to count.
Where is the version with audio?
It’s amazing little gestures like these that keep me from feeling totally defeated by the current state of the world. Love this so much.
This is the best thing. <3 This teacher really taught them a valuable lesson. His reaction is adorable!
I think my eyes are *sweating*...
Is there no sound for this video?
We need sound.
IM NOT CRYING, IM NOT CRYING
Just beautiful
watched this in public and STILL almost cried
I'm at work why u do dis to me
The kid in the front in the red tee shirt clearly had no idea what was happening and just waved his arms around until he got to the pointing part
I put my sound on smh 🤦‍♀️
Related story. One of my nieces is deaf. We went for her 3rd or 4th birthday. Most of her friends at the birthday party were also deaf. Now when the cake cutting was gonna happen I was talking to some relative, and before I could start clapping based on whenever I hear the usual “ Happppppppyy birthdayyyyyy....” the thing was over. I got confused as to what just happened and then I realized, these kids sang in ASL, and obviously didn’t clap because they don’t have to make clapping sound and more obviously their hands were busy signing Happy Birthday in sign language. Long story short, I felt happy for my deaf niece after I realized that she has her own cute little world with friends who love her a lot.Even after watching this video, I felt the something similar. First I wished it had sound but then I realized that these are people from my niece’s cute little world.
I need this with sound because I can't hear the song
just woke up and reddit has me crying why???
" look at deez lil crackas throwing gang signs. They make me so proud"
If this doesn’t tug at your heartstrings, you’re dead inside
This is beautiful ❤️
Fuck gifs. Would be 10x better with sound
Jesus... this hit me hard. It’s really beautiful when people do things like this for other people. It restores faith in humanity for a few moments.
I had the sound off. Was they all in sync
My dad was an elementary school principal at 5 or 6 schools when i was growing up - his best friend was always the janitor.In fact now that im thinking about it when he changed schools he always took his secretary and janitor with him.They were like part of our family
What are the green numbers with a diamond next to the gold marker on this post?
Where's the sound?
Why did I expect sound in this video? o\_O
Ok i love life again
Made my morning. Thank you.
These beautiful damn custodian videos just make me tear up so hard. The love! It’s PALPABLE!!
Beautifully adorable. Happy birthday.
I'm not crying, stupid
Kids again for the win
Sobbing at the gym. For the first time not bc of the damn stairmaster.
opposite of /r/noisygifs?
All the school custodians who aren't getting kid parties these days are feeling pretty bad.
this is so beautiful
The real MVP
This is beautiful
I swear someone just cut 50 lbs of onions near me or something
Why can’t I upvote this more than once?
Long may this appreciation of janitor trend continue. I want them honored alongside soldiers at sporting events soon!
Thanks for this. I heard the story on the radio and said he was blind. I had a lot of questions.
That kind of news keeps my hope for humanity afloat.
Is it insensitive to ask for a link with sound?
Glad to see kids are treating cleaning personnel better these days, atleast some anyway.  My granddad was a janitor at a school and every day kids would smear shit on the walls and purposely piss on the floor and sometimes they would get creative and shit in the sink. That's why i refuse to accept contracts with schools now, they pay more usually but the work is 10 times harder because of kids not understanding how to keep their enviroment clean and they don't understand another person has to clean up what they don't. Schools are the quickest way to get employees to quit because it's too much, so i just don't accept their contracts.
Lol looks like it's a new trend to see which elementary school can get the most likes being nice to their custodian. Is it just me, or does recording a kind act subtracts a significant amount of genuineness?
something something Sony something something copyright claim.
Thats amazing!
We never amounted to this but everyone loved our custodian back in elementary school
This is awesome! Finally a post on AWWW that doesn't involve dogs.
This is awesome, I bet this made his day.
Can we get the video with audio?
My grandpa was also a deaf custodian - this is really special
So amazing and cute. However Really should have blurred the kids faces. Unless all of their parents signed consent forms. I feel like people do not take into account privacy in or modern age.
I’d die
This is so wholesome I am actually crying. A post has never done this to me before
It took me a second to figure out why this video had no sound..
That's it. I got my sunshine for the day. Bugging off before Reddit takes dark turn on me.
👐
I’d like to see a version of this with sound
Where's the audio?
This made me fuzzy. Might've teared up a bit.
Custodians are some of the nicest people I’ve met.
I can't lie. I was kinda hoping his reaction stayed the same, but they were all giving him the finger.
Where's the sound?
Why do all these custodian vids gotta make me cry? I didn’t ask for this damnit.
Is there an audio version?
nani?! what jutsu is this?
this is the cutest shit i’ve ever seen
This is fucking beautiful.
This is just amazing 😄
So beautiful! Love all the custodian appreciation posts recently.
The greatest thing.
Wish this video had sound
More of this stuff, please.
One of the reasons I started taking ASL was because I was going to be a traveling nurse. I never did, but I did continue with ASL.I wanted to travel the US and help those who weren't understood. To help those who needed support in hospitals that couldnt give them enough attention.My professor who taught me ASL told me those who are Deaf/hearing impaired have issues with hospitals because they dont feel properly represented. Since then whenever I'm working it always makes my day knowing I can help someone in ASL. Its never expected and it brings a big smile to their face.
How come there’s no sound?
Is it wrong that i turned my volume up
Amazing such a nice thing to do
r/humansbeingbros
This warmed my heart so much
I'm too drunk to watch. Too many feels
This really brightened up my morning.

Is this what thanking the bus driver has evolved into? I don't know where I am anymore.
Why isn’t there any sound?? Oh..
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
I really wish i had my headphones for this 😪
Where's the audio?
I’d love to hear the audio for this song
Crying at work.
Wtf I dont hear....Oh I'm fucking dumb
Where's the sound?
Why no sound
That made me tear up straight up. How beautiful. :)
My heart
AWESOME!!!!
If they did this every year it might get a bit patronizing, but it's still heartwarming nonetheless.
I loved our elementary school custodian. Great guy that did awesome impressions, always making us laugh, and always responded to vomit lickity split. Miss that dude.
r/humansbeungbros
Go teacher :-) awesome!!
Custodians are under-appreciated. They do so much for or schools.
/r/quietgifs
That’s what being Human is all about!
These make me so happy that I'm going to start watching one a day to make me content
Stealig viral video ideas is tight
I love the janitor appreciation trend
I'm not crying! You're crying!
Amazing
Aww!! Kudos to the awesome teacher that had this idea, I'm sure it meant the world to him.
Aww omg this made me cry. He is so happy. What a wonderful thing to do.
Can’t look at this sub at my desk in the office. People probably think I’m stuck in a glass case of emotions.
Amazing! Make me smile today :)
I was about to ask why not post the video....I guess it’s not really needed in this case.
Aww his reaction is incredible
That should make anyones day, lovely 😊
😭🙏🏼💖
This is beyond beautiful
Too early for onions
Right in the feels.
His reaction has made the rest of my week. What a swell guy
Thats fucking awesome
i used to hang out with the younger guys on my school's catering staff at the weekends. We'd hang out in the staff accommodation, drink beer, play playstation, watch movies, play pool etc.they were my beer and cigs connection throughout my later years at school.boarding school is an interesting place :D
I love humans!
I'd cry if I walked into one of my classrooms and something like this happened.Don't think any of my crews birthdays are known to anyone though.
There is no sound in the video?
Why is their no sound on the video?
If hes deaf how does he know the tune and cultural significance of hearing happy birthday?
Why did I try turning this up to hear his reaction
This is beautiful
Way to turn my heart to mush! ♥️
-Faith in Humanity +5
There is no audio!
How come there’s now sound?
Wish this video had sound.... ohhhh.
There are loads of fine people out there.I need reminders.  Thanks op!
If everyone learned sign there would be no more babble.  It would make it much easier to learn a new language too.  They could correct you when you're saying it wrong.
*frantically turns up volume
Hopefully goes down as his best birthday ever!
I'm sure this is supposed to be aww, but I'm more focused on the little asshole in the red shirt that's bullshit signing and having a laugh.
ow ow ow ow my heart is exploding
I tired to turn this up so I could hear them sing......
I think I'm expecting a wholesome overdose!
I clicked and expected audio. I’m not that smart.
Waiting for mods to lock the thread for no reason..
Where’s the sound?
THERE IS SOMETHING IN MY EYEBALL
Nice to see so many custodians getting lots of love lately.
Tear jerker!
r/mademesmile
There's no sound...
Why is there no sound?Oh I’m an idiot

Where did this happen!?
At first I was like damb videos without sound, then I remembered the title.
Go away, feels. I didn't ask you to come here.
Absolutely beautiful!!!!!😍😍😍😘
How wonderfully heartwarming and endearing! Both the kids and the teachers are restoring humanity.
r/mademesmile
Hit me right in the gut
Oh,, Oh,, My heart,, :’)
I doubly concur!
I'm so far in the feels rn
Ah shit jokes on me. I immediately tried to turn the volume up.
These videos are KILLINGGGG MEEEEE today!!!
I know want to learn sign language!
Anybody have a video with sound?
That's so f*ckin' cool!
This made my eyes leak. It's just truly amazing I love it.
Why is there no sound?
Sometimes reddit makes me cry happy tears. This is so sweet.
I‘d love to see this with audioE: OP, source?
Quick! someone hand me a rag to wipe all these tears up while he enjoys this beautiful moment
Any chance there's a video with sound?!
Awww this is so sweet ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭
Where's the sound?
Dude almost forgets to keep standing. God damn that is so sweet
Am deaf, this made me smile so much.
His reaction is so sweet! So cute!
This is the sweetest, kindest, and most thoughtful thing I've seen in a great while!
Moments like this restore my Faith in Humanity.
All this nice stuff people keep doing for custodians has me thinking of a career change.
No tap to unmute?  Wait...
Janitors / custodians have been getting some love from kids lately. There was just another video posted where the kids threw a surprise party for one. Looked like the entire elementary school was present. Heartwarming.
r/dogswithjobs
Is this what they mean by 'sled dog?'
I know that dog! His name is Truckee and he a avi dog at heavenly mountain resort in South Lake Tahoe. He loves sliding
me: turn left...left...TURN LEFT
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
some say he is still sliding to this day
That is hilarious.  My old boy would have done that if he could.  He was a black lab that would spend all day hanging out in the snowy yard when it was 15 degrees F.
He’s just cooling off after sweeps last March I think it was. Somehow the end of the video was cut off but he does flip himself over and starts running again.  Follow him on Instagram: @truckeetheavalanchedog  I have the full video uploaded there. I try to keep it exciting but he’s always at work in the winter w his dad, and guys don’t remember to post badass pictures to Instagram. Lol Glad you all like the video.  There’s no cliff, it’s off Ridge Run at Heavenly when he was working at Sky Patrol. Sometimes he just slides down the mountain at the end of the day, sometimes he jogs slowly side to side so it’s not hard on his body, other times he’s on the back of a sled or loads up on my bf’s shoulders. Cheers everyone.
https://i.imgur.com/92Ht573.gifv
tahoe area? heavenly or northstar?
I genuinely wonder how many dogs have gone off cliffs doing this.... is sledding a learned trait from watching humans? Does this happen in the wild?

Very enthusiastic and a great work ethic I would hire him.
This dog shreds
This is pure snow! It's everywhere! Do you have any idea what the street value of this mountain is?
For something to be fun enough to drag your junk through snow, that's what I'm missing.
Did pupper make it down the hill?!?! I need to know if he's okay
/r/sweatypaws
Gorgeous scenery! Where is this?
HELP. HELP!!!OH no buster someone needs our help.Don't worry Garry we will get there when we get there. Follow my lead.
I was a bit worried the doggy couldn't stop and was gonna crash through a Walmart.
Man it sure doesn't feel great to know that a dog can ski better than me
It's like when you kill a wolf on a mountain in Skyrim. Lol
"This is normal"-dog
At first glance, I thought the black of the tree line was the edge of a cliff and that good boye was headed to certain doom.
Two things come to mind: 1: this is the happiest dog I have ever seen2: please don't hit a tree sweet boy
Getting in some good belly and side scritches.
I thought it was approaching a cliff at first. I’m very released that my eyes were just playing tricks on me.
Can I sign up for this dog’s job?
Love how he grabs some snacks as he goes along. He’s a good boy.
Ha it’s a dog sled
Remember sliding down those hot metal slides in the summer as a kid? This isn’t like that at all.
I love him so much.
"In top news, tesla introduces autopilot mode for search and rescue dogs"
Snowboardercollie
That dog is more of a skier than I'll ever be.
Can’t help but feel uneasy as he gets closer to that lowered treelike/what looks like the edge
This dog fucking loves cocaine
I watched this ten times, laugh-cried, and sent it to a group chat of snowboarders and watched them do the same on the thread. Well done.
That's actually how dogs are trained to search for people in avalanches.
You could say the dog was lying down on the job. ;)
All this just for one pesky itch.
Stupid question. I get that dogs have fur to protect from the cold but wouldn't jumping on snow get them cold?

If I went to work like this daily, I would be complete.
Give this dog a beer commercial.
He is not a sled-dog, but he is a dog-sled.
„Welcome to the beginner‘s group. First of all we need to learn how to slide correctly after falling. I‘ll demonstrate and you keep following my raised paw, please“
Is anyone else getting sweaty palms as he approaches the ledge??
That is hilarious. My old boy would have done that if he could. He was a black lab that would spend all day hanging out in the snowy yard when it was 15 degrees F.
I can't believe people are asking "how dos he stop?".He's got four-wheel drive.
Labs love water in all its forms
That is the happiest dog in the world.
Are we going to need to send a recuse dog to rescue dog?
legend has it he is still sliding to this very day
Dear God... The coefficient of friction under that dog is null! He could go on like this forever!!
Everybody say 'Colorado'!IM A DOG
ok I am really concerned that doggo is about to go careening off a cliff  :(
Am I the only one worried he’s gonna fall off the mountain?
I wish I could do that...
*Well, this is my life now. And I like it.*
On this day, all of his itches were scratched.
That dog and I have very similar riding styles. I'm not very good at snowboarding...
Is that Mookie from Vail?? I miss that pupper...

But what if he can't control himself and needs help 😦

This is the best thing ever.

I like when he chomps out and has a little snow snack during the start of the slide.
This is the most peaceful thing
No Reddit post has ever made me happier
This dog looks like it is heading straight for a cliff.
Hell, I wish I loved my job that much.
I'm going to learn to snowboard because of this for real
This makes me really want to learn how to snowboard

If he were my dog, I’d name him Shredder.
What a very good boy. Also this looks like fun.
It ain’t work if you love it.
Lucky dog.
One paw up for stability.
There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!
Let the dog ski.
How does he stop
I wonder if dogs know they are working or it's just sort of their daily life.
Pioneers used to ride those babies for days!
I love how he’s eating the snow on the way
Dog sled.
I want to love my job just as much as this dog does.

This dog, he gets it. Slide baby slide.
I would love to be able to experience happy dog memories when I'm sad. I feel like this moment is so full of joy.
Serious question because I’ve seen this I think 6-7 times now posted and it looks like a poorer quality.  Is a repost automatically downscaled or is it a product of some other process?
Some say he's still going to this day
What kind of snake is that?
Looks like Tahoe?
This by far is my favorite post  EVER!!!!!!
Reminds me of the Mario 64 level with the baby penguin!

I hope his job isn't to track lost or injured skiers or something... Heh.
That's one cool dog
every dog has its day
Nonsense! The sweetheart deserves it. Slide on, pal!
What I wanna know is how is he sliding so effortlessly? That looks hella fun
Is he a perpetual motion machine?
Oh my goodness. This dog is my hero.
lake tahoe?
He's working, relaxing, scratching his back, and playing all at the same time.
is that dog okay?
I would be so scared of him / her falling off the side of that run...
Thanks! Needed that so bad after shithole today :)
Hopefully he made it down safely, kinda makes me nervous
I can’t help but envy how good that must feel.
That is a very satisfied employee right there
He and that sliding elephant should team up...
Imagine how many dogs slid off of cliffs sliding like this.
Why is it that nothing puts me in a better mood than a dog having the time of it’s life?
The ultimate back scratch
Tahoe?
Wow...It's pretty depressing to learn that a dog is cooler than I am.Just kidding! I've already known that.
OH. That’s muh balls! Let me just roll over into my back. Ahhhhhh.
I am so envious of this dog.
Best way to not get up in the morning.
the infinite scratch
The rollover on to side with paw in air is a true sign of enjoyment
So I CAN bring my dog skiing !?
I am rescue dog! Lookit me slide!
when i grow up i wanna ~~be just as excited as~~ him ~~about his job~~
That is absolutely adorable
...Is he loving his job a bit too much or having a "take the wheels, Jesus" moment?
I wanna see him fetch a tennis ball. You think the skidding past the ball is bad on grass, just wait until this happens.
Gets to the bottom“Alright slope’s good!! C’mon down!!”
I want this dogs life.
Gifs that end too soon...was there a ledge? Oh I hope not.
Somebody please make a shooting stars mix
I have a feeling it's not his first time doing this.
This is what it's like trying to get my dog off the couch at night.
What a Gnar Dog
I like how he almost uses his tail as a rudder in the beginning. In his mind hes Snoopy the Aerial Ace and hes on the hunt for the dastardly Red Baron
Hey, that's my technique. Either on my stomach or my back, but not on the actual snowboard.

Casually chomps on a bit of snow before going on his epic slide...  What a silly boy.  I wonder what his trainers thought the first time he started sliding down a slope, then just kept going.
This is so pure.

Hope he has some breaks.
What are the requirements for a job like this?
I thought it was just flat ground I was so confused how he was sliding and then I realized he was sliding down hill
He has found a way to get both the scratchies and the zoomies at the same time.

If there's anything that dog posts have taught me today, it's that this dog is probably stressed because his ears are back.I'm being sarcastic, this is a lovely post.

Oh yes, mountain scratchies are best scratchies.
I love that when the dog starts clearly going towards the trees the owner clearly speeds up and gets between him and certain pain
Great technique. Tummy rubs for you.

I don't know, I think he's loving it just the right amount.
Lol that high arm "Whuuuuuut!"
Jealous
for some reason I think this is so sweet.  what a really seriously great dog!  good for you & him!  I mean - why can't life always be so sweet as this?
Snowbork
I just imagine "Otherside" playing in the background.
That's actually how snow rescue dogs get down from the slopes. Trust me, I'm also a dog and do that
That is one chill doggo
Dogs are straight up the best animals
I just started. Your post help me decided to do it!
Don’t deny this soft boi the happiness he deserves
Had to comment 667
I like how one of his legs goes straight up during the flow down, trying to smooth ride on his back
Slide.
I just started. Your post help me decided to do it!
This is fucking awesome! Wish I could get down the hill as easily as he does. My biggest problem is the lift. I hate getting off the lift. 😒
awwwww...i really hope he stopped before, what seems like, the end of the cliff
Is he...dabbing?
This is childish but don’t their genitals chaff?
Are they trained to do that to decend faster?
Lets Goooo !
Yo that’s fucking wild that that dog is just sliding down the hill.   So badass
Everyone on Reddit is a bot except for you
My sister has a lab and he is a living form of cocaine in the snow
Too much? Da fuq?That looks like "just enough" to me!
Too cute
Must be...heavenly
PIZZA!!! PIZZA!!!!! PIZZZZAAA!!!
Pure Joy.
Very nice post! Keep it up!
He's a Red Cross scoot-hound?

Humans arent good enough for dogs.  They are simply too amazing.
I miss snowboarding at Heavenly!
Snowboi
GOOD BOY
Where's the one with the retriever doing the same thing?
Chomping on bits of snow as he goes. Hilarious.
[ohh really] (http://www.hardwareandtools.com.pk/product/tolsen-heavy-duty-tool-bag-17/)
Loving his job just enough, unless he went over the cliff. Then, a bit too much
This is Tahoe. I board here all the time.
Is he still sliding to this day??
Everyone on reddit is a bot except you
This looks just like my friend when we first went skiing together ;)
This seriously brought tears of joy to my eyes.
Just amazing
Same here
I'm a bit worried that he will drop somewhere.
My home
Aeeewww
That was definitely not this year. That's Ridge Run at Heave-n-leave. No snow in Tahoe. We're riding MTN bikes instead.
We all should be able to do it at least once in a lifetime, voluntarily. I had done it once, on a long slope, but I was forced to do it so I do not bump into people in front of me.
This is quite possibly the greatest thing I've ever seen on the internet

SHREDDIN'!
I've seen many people leave mountain bars like this after too much apres ski!
Dog sledding :D
I love this good boi
A working dog is a happy dog!
So this just made me really happy. There is good in this world
Yolo:))
great post!

I love how he chomps the snow on the way down.
Awww, so cute.

This was the last video taken of that poor, poor dog

Dogs will be dogs 🤣

Imagining this happening with no humans to witness it is even stranger.
i always wonder how dogs dont freeze their dicks doing stuff like this
How do you stop a dog when it's going down hill like this?
Dude, are you gonna hit the brakes anytime soon? Avalanche is coming.
Is owner on a ski or snowmobile or drone ...or a ghost ?
Simple pleasures are the best...
Some say he is still sliding to this day.
You say he's enjoying it too much, but it looks to me like he's enjoying it just the right amount.
I don't get what its job is.
He looks like he's having so much fun
Did that dog just fucking *dab,* on the way by??
Very cute, much wow!
OH MY GOD SOMEONE HOLD THE DOGGY!
Great for that itch you just can’t scratch.
He is either on his way to save Someone or he's scratching himself
Autodogs, roll out!
Nice post:)
It looks more like he/she has fallen and can't get up.
Where is this place btw? It's breathtaking!
Hope he stuck the landing 😂
Best boye 😍🖤
 And the dog never came back !!
I know da wae
Thanks so much for the help you have been giving me.
This is the best thing i've seen this year

I love the way they work around the cat. Like it's amazing that this is something they go and do each night, but even more so to me that the cat starts in the middle and waits for the worlds best whirlpool to suck them up and carry them away to cozyland. .
I will never in my life be as god-tier comfy as this cat.
Looks very cozy for the cat, but one of the dogs is laying on a ball.
Not sure if the warmth is from the dogs or the heater ❤
Cat: "Heated bed, assemble.   Very good."
Real pack mentality here.  The two biggest members are keeping the littlest pack member safe in the middle
This is quite possibly the cutest thing I've ever seen!
That’s what I call being successful in life
cat: "time for bed fellow dogs"
They even form a heart
Is there a definite list of all the cute gifs/videos for these doggos/cat?  It appears to be the same cast as - https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9vv0rf/go_get_your_brother_for_a_picturehttps://i.imgur.com/IQ0qrem.gifvhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EsJ_rVJ9To&feature=youtu.behttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOY0akenssE
That is so sweet.
This has to be the dog that's always posted pulling the cat by the leash, right?
I wanna be this cat
They make a heart.😊❤️
i am the cat -these my frens herei like when theycurl up so neari keep my spothere on the bed,they circle roundthen hang their headsome cats have kitsat night they hold, but me - i'll keep my bed of gold
Good god, if that's not the cutest thing I've seen all month...
They look as if they’ve been asked to do a demonstration of it. At the end they all look a bit awkward like they’re wondering if they can get back to what they were doing before you asked them to show reddit how they sleep.
Nothing warms my cold, frigid heart like seeing cute dogs and cute cats interacting in friendly ways. Look at them. *Look at them!* They're so goddamn cute! They're friends and they love each other and it's *fucking adorable!*
Further proof that cats run the world.

When I see things like this it makes me wish my corgi and cat weren't bitter enemies.
Their bodies are making a little heart
The dogs almost make a heart shape!
And they have a heater 😍😍😍
Sir, you have a beautiful family.
two dogs and a radiator, that's pretty cat comfortable.
The royal guards.
Well looks like I'm getting two dogs now.
Cuteness overload!
lol wow.  what a perfect video
My God but that's cute. I think my eyeball's just melted.....
When going to sleep becomes a coordinated operation.
Is it wrong to be jealous of a cat ?
These besties just made my day 😊
You don't know if they sleep like that every night though OP, if it's just another one of your shitty reposts.
Omg! This is so sweet!
But that ball! it's gotta be jabbing the dog all night long.
Cuteness overload ❤️
My cat just walks on my face
That cat has has 99 problems but having warm cuddly friends is not one of them!
Does anyone else see the cat looks like it’s smiling? Lol
I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything cuter. Thanks OP
S’mores!
How vanilla oreos are made
A couple people have mentioned the dog lying on the ball. I thought I was a pessimist, you must suck the joy out of every room you enter.
Christ, get a bigger bed for those dogs, or at least spend twenty and get another
The sweetest little cuddle puddle!!!
Threesome. Should be marked NSFW.

Get them a new squishier bed
I’m super jealous of that cat.
That kitty is the only one who knows how lucky he is. Too cute!
Cat checks his bed before finally laying down like..  "yup, everyone's in the right spot.  Night"

Id take that same spot!
That cat has got it right!
So very precious
That is adorable!

I wish my German Shepard would do this with my kitty. All she wants to do is chase my poor cats around. Even though my damn cat instigates.
These three pets are the stars of reddit now. They have so much stuff going on every week
finally a cat can sleep in the dogs bed
Brb off to buy some golden retrievers
Good owner.. There's a little space heater for the kids
I cried
Right next to that power bill engorging fire hazard.Chill - I have like 3.
How did you like that heater? I'm thinking about getting the same one.
For a second I thought the second Goldie was going to accidentally body slam the cat laying down but it perfectly angled itself so they both could get maximum snuggles 😽
They’re the three best friends that anyone could have. They’re the three best friends that anyone could have....
Have you ever come home drunk and joined them?
So sweet!!! I love it!!
Ah yes, the ceremonial circling of the wag-ens.I'm here all week. Try the fish.
Why the f would you wait so long to post thos, if it happens EVERY night
My heart ❤
They make a heart ❤️
THIS IS FUCKINGN ADORABLE
Too flipping cute!
Thats cute even though i kinda hate cats
They literally form a heart.
This is the cat that the golden picks up and removes from starting fights!
I can almost hear them saying “Right lads, it’s sleep time, you know the drill.”
Cate: "See human?  The Doggos are now also mine, and they provide me with warmth at my whim.  Now go bring me food and drink."
This. Cutest. Thing. Can’t. Even.
This is what they do on camera and off camera they fight like cat and dogs.
That cat is SET UP.
Most definitely a lie. It's rather obvious the dogs are uncomfortable and ordered to lay down.
The fact you add "every night" surely means it s not.  I guess Human can't stand the truth.
r/eyebleach
My happiness is immeasurable and my day is made.
The dog on the right has to sleep on a ball. That's going to be painful in the morning.

They look like two proud cat parents.
Out of everything I've ever seen on r/awe, this is the only one I audibly said, "awwwe," for.
I cannot even handle how adorable and endearing this is....
So funny how they all get into sleep formation!
Heaven is indeed a place on earth.
Dogs are pack animals. They’re cute too.
Aren't these the same dogs that broke up a cat fight by picking this cat up by it's harness and carrying it away?
They look like an older couple who just got a kid that doesn't want to sleep by him/herself haha

That is just the cutest. I have 2 chihuahuas and a cat and they all disagree with each other. This would never happen in a million years.
oh noe that one on the right is sleeping on a ball
God that's soo cute😍
Lovely
Sofa always have to do at least a 180 before laying down! Why??
This is the most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
I really want to join that cuddly sandwich
Adorbs.
Ah yes, my servants
OwwwwO
My dogs wont even sleep in the same room lol
Whoever it is piling my heartstrings, please stop
This looks so cozy.
Catto has some god-awesome Floof guards
They feel comfortable in that way..
This is one of the sweetest things I've seen on Reddit in a long time! To be fair, I absolutely love Goldens.
More videos or it didn't happen!
And meanwhile I can't even have my cats walk past each other without fighting.They are sisters though.
They all want a piece of that space heater! Whenever my wife clicks on hers the dog and two cats come sprinting to lay in front of that thing!
So they just sleep every night uncomfortable af?
SWEETEST DAMN THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY
It’s a heart with a kitty filled center!!
They kind of make a little heart shape too
Those dogs are your cats peasants.
This absolutely melts my heart.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything cuter. Thanks OP
That's the sweetest thing I've seen today!!
Oh my! So loving!
Good. man, you left a heater for them
I just wanna climb in there

So cute! I'm curious as to Why so many people own Goldies? I'm not complaining, just curious. I see them all the time. Is it some new dog fad or something? Are they over bred? Hmm...
It makes a natural <3 shape! :D
Oh god, my heart.
That is Adorable!!
Lucky cat.
This is a cuddle valley if I've ever seen one...
My cat kinda does the same, loves going to sleep tucked between my legs near the crouch
Aww they made a heart shape, what a heart warming scene with the kitty choosing the warmth of friends over the radiator.
Universe is amazing
Dogs and cats living together
I would feel really left out if these were my pets
How can I get in on this?!
Looks uncomfortable sleep for the dogs
Aren't they the trained dogs from the videos where they pull that cat away from a fight?
Kitty looked right into the cam and smiled three times. As if any confirmation of contentment was needed.
What a beautiful family!

This is so sweet

That is like the cutest thing ever.
Did they both want the wall spot at the start? Look how they go for it! Haha I picture them wanting it’s comforting pressure, but only getting it every other night.
this is like sleeping inside a tauntaun to a cat
So cute😍
It’s even shaped like a heart
This I think is why Reddit exists.
I saw someone use this in another post already. I have no problem with reposts, but just thought I would point that out
How do they know when is time to sleep?
Oh my god. That is TOO much cuteness!!
Can you post more of them doing this everydayWould make my days
so like a sack of potatoes!! then?
The cat sits down first.  I love it!
<3
I’d pay $500 a night to get in on that slumber party.
The dogs formed into a heart!!!
I want that for me. Is that weird?
Omg, adorable! And love how they form a heart with the cat in the middle, just purrfect!
All aboard the snuggle bus!
That’s very nice to have pets caring for each other (add me!)
What a life that cat has. A great house, food, family who loves him/her and two dog brothers who also ..are her bodyguards?
This makes me want more than one pet
Space heater basically makes this shooting fish in a karma barrel :p
What a happy, snuggly life.
Shadow, shadow and sassy. Poor Chance didn’t get in on the action.
How many dog biscuits did this cat paid for this kind of security?

So pure.
These are the same dogs who carry the cat around like that one video where the cat was in a a fight and the dog carried it away
Omg my heart

Bullshit! Cats don’t sleep at night!
Awww they’re so adorably organised. Looks so warm and comfy.
The best thing about my day. Thank you!!!
It's a heart!!!
*this is how they sleep in this video I found online
I love them
Can I use all my karma to be that cat in my next life?
Looks like a big furry heart.
There's a space heater like one meter away, of course the animals are going to pile up right there.
This is why I want another dog. My pup is very high energy and we cant always meet his needs. If we got him a buddy and a doggy door to let them roam our backyard and play, he would never look sad ever again
Is this the cat that always gets dragged out side by the dog?
Lucky kitty! So sweet!
That's too much. I'm pretty sure that video just broke me. The amount of Aww+animals being bros+cute+StopIt!!! Resulted in, what seems to be, a system shut down. It was a good way to go, though. Too bad I never got to se
That dog didn't care that he laid on the ball
Comfy as fuck
the cat's like, "awwww yeeeeeeez"
So these dogs sleep face to face with each other and pretty close to the face of a cat but I always get dog butt? What the fuck

I just had to put my 12 year old golden down on Thursday. Haven't been able to go to work and pretty much in a constant depression since then. He was truly my best friend and has been with me through everything. I thought watching this would make it worse but it might be the first time I've actually smiled since last week. Thank you.
How do they wake up though?

With the space heater right in front of them.... No wonder, lol
Goldens are the BEST!
Now this is a quality aww video. Made me actually giggle a little at how cute it was.

Makes sense. Dogs are already predisposed to follow the alpha of the pack. They may vie for dominance, but eventually, one of them submits, the other being the dominant. But cats don’t follow anyone, bring largely solitary predators. They will fight, and if necessary, often to the death. So if there is a fight for dominance, the dog will submit usually before the cat
This cured all that ails me

Can’t you grab a blanket and tuck them in?

Stupid question. Do the dogs maintain specific sides of the bed where they sleep?
And when one of the dogs rolles over in their sleep?
Your catness
It’s an actual dog bed
So I entered a tunnel on public transit as this video was playing and now it won’t load anymore. Does anyone have an alternative link? Must have cuteness overload!

Together they make a heart! So cute.
Good doggos.
They form something like a furry heart with their bodies.
Second dog just laid down on a ball. She’s certainly not the Princess & the Pea
I love how the cat just seems to get sleepy the second positions are assumed. So sweet 🤣
In the shape of a heart too! ❤️
I wish I was dead this is so beautiful
So sweet!!
Good for you for having a heater for them. My cats gravitate towards any source of heat so I got them a heated blanket. They cant stay away
God..move that ball from under him.
It....just really bothers me that the second dog lay down on that tennis ball. I can just feel it
I love the way that dog on the outside seems to make sure the dog on the inside is comfortable before he gets onto the bed to sleep. So much love
A golden kitten sandwich 😍
Damn goldens are great
That’s so sweet. 💕
That is the most snugglybuggly thing I’ve ever seen and I want to be right in the middle of it
Don’t just film, move the ball for doggio!
This is so strange. My mother shared a different video of this same cat and one of the dogs in the same house. I could tell by the collar on the kitty and tiles on the floor.For the record, the dog grabbed kitty by the scruff of his neck and dragged him along the floor to where he wanted him. Kitty didn't mind.
Turn the heat up!
Goldens are the best!
i wonder if the cat actually sleeps  mine are very active overnights,  it's why i keep my door closed,   let them run amok while i sleep.
Wonder if the Cat knows she's adopted yet >.>
They are careful not to smuch tiny funny looking doggo

Run! Their hair never leaves you.Source-I have a white dog.
A friend of mine in the 80's used to breed these dogs. They are Samoyeds and as beautiful as they are they the sort of dog that only people that obsess about their dogs should keep. Not only do they do they have that fur to maintain but they are a working dog and need an active owner. They also like company so having just one is only a good option for people that have someone at home most of the time. They are stunning though.

How they have a warehouse full of lint rollers! I’ve had 2 huskies before, trashed my vacuum.
Wow I can barely fit one polar bear in my car, let alone three
Hail hydr*awwww*
That's a storm to you? Where I'm from we just call that "snowing".
Snow Cerberus
Here it is! The 2018 Doge Grand Caravan...
Looks like getting the middle seat isn't desirable even in doggo world.
Nice ford
Are you kidding me??? THEY are the REASON for the snowstorm!
It looked like they were all wearing green t-shirts at first glance before I realised it was the window!
Cerberus
My favorite band, Three Dog Day
I don't know why, but this scene just looks so christmas-y to me.
They’re making sure no snow gets in their owners car. Such a good bunch of boys
Anyone else think title sounded like click-bait?
snowstorm, more like light and gentle snow falling down
Pretty sure that's a quest objective. If they each have the voice of a cute Japanese girl, run, you're in the wrong kind of game.
It's Young Cerberus, guardian of the Gates to Heck!
Samoyed are made out of snow, so it doesn't really bother them. In fact they like it, along with the cold.
At least the owner cracked the window so they won't get too hot.
Where are you that this is considered a snowstorm.  That's like, Monday afternoon weather.
These are snow clouds.
Thank you reddit, for being the eye bleach I need after logging off Twitter..
Should've used a masterball for the dogtrio
I see the owner wisely left the window open so they don't overheat.
This looks nothing like a snow storm.  in a snow storm you would barely be able to see that white car.
They have a quest for you
Looks like a normal day in Alberta, haha
>snowstormAccumulation of almost half an inch! Visibility of barely half a mile!

What kind of sad excuse for a snowstorm is that?

I can't blame you. They blend in quite well.
3 snowballs in a snowstorm isn't enough
It's the mythical CerBURRRRRus
These are Samoyeds not Siberian Huskies.
I feel like I saw these same dogs in Massachusetts or New Hampshire.
I'm seeing triple!Nine huskies!

It's Cerberus the 3 headed puppy that guards the gate of Heck
I mean, at least he cracked the window before he left.
Looks like a dodge mini van. Believe it.
That's the best!! I always loved being able to just leave my windows wide open like that with the malamutes inside.  Wide, wide open.  Life was so good to them they never even considered climbing out :)  Just like these 3
I would have to beg the owner to shoot me too, these guys look like too much fun...
Don't know where you are from, but that is not a snowstorm around these parts.
It wouldn't matter what kinda crappy day I was having, this would instantly make it better.
My two American Akita’s will do the same thing! They get pissed if I have the heat on in the car no matter how cold it is outside. Coldest we’ve been in was -6° and while I could barely walk straight, they were wrestling and having the time of their lives. I love dogs.
They left the window open, what's wrong with this? My border collie has the answer: not enough snow in the car.Also, the one in the middle looks like he's been smushed before, knew it was coming, accepted his fate and then changed his mind.
Really cloudy outside
At first glance I thought all their heads were poking out of the same T-shirt, whilst hanging out the window..the actual result is still equally as cute
Middle dog is either thinking"I fucking hate these guys"or "I fucking love these guys"
The fearsome Cerberus!

As cute as this pic is there is an issue: lack of diversity. White snow. Grey van. White pets. Needs some PoC (pets of color). It's 2018. C'mon.I kid.
I thought they were wearing a cute jacket

I know polar bears are endangered but I can't believe they're desperate enough to resort to stealing cars.This is a wake up call, people.
Dugtrio and Ninetails decided that they actually had something in common
Legend has it, their fur was black before the snow storm

I wish people would stop leaving their animals in the car, they’re going to overheat!
Beautiful!
Not sure that they are licensed to drive
Hey at least they left the window(s) for ventilation.
One more and they could do barbershop!

What up dawg.
Even Cerberus likes car rides
What is it? Lemme SEE! My turn!
What’s better than *a* Sammy? *3* sammies!!

In hot weather, leave your window down if leaving dogs in the car.
MOAR PLEEEZ!
Please be responsible and not leave your pets in the car on hot days!
Awesome
Hello, Hello!, HELLO!!
Hop in loser, we're going skiing.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I pulled up next to these three amidst a snowstorm/it's three dogs in a car (one click)
That's Cerberus, the three headed guardian of heck.

This is one of the few times in the year when it's perfectly fine to leave your dogs in the car 🤣
Please tell me their heads all moved in the same direction as well.
So cute! Adorable puppies.

“Amidst a snowstorm”Honey, they ARE the snowstorm.

Shame they left their window open in the storm and let the snow drift in.
They are the cutest puppies ever
Then who's driving?!
In a blizzard, they'd be invisible.
They are frozen together :D
Fucking love Samoyeds!
In Sweden we call that light snowfall.
They're ready for a three dog night.

Hello fren, nice weather we're having
This was especially shocking since I live in a right hand drive country
I was wondering how they dressed all three dogs in scrubs.
Omg I just made a charm with one of those doggo on, I swear! I cannot believe they have the eyes like wedges and big black noses. I want to just hug them for hours. http://imgur.com/cc5VYlk

I thought they were wearing green doggy pajamas. Nope, just the window.
I don't see a snowstorm happening though? Just a light dusting.

They're like: let us out! Can't stay inside on a day like this!
I dunno where you live, but where I live this is normal weather. Thats a weak lookin storm
They are too damn adorable.

Loving it. Had an Akita. She would go nuts in the cold. Just was happy as could be. Summer she was lethargic and glib.
That's a sphinx I wouldn't mind answering a riddle from.

Props to the owner for still rolling the window down for those fluff puppers.
I once lived in the highest town in the US, well over 10K elevation.  Saw it snow every month of the year.  I had a Samoyed, smartest dog I ever owned.  It could be well below zero F, with feet of snow on the ground, and he would refuse to come in.

Dogs have a sense of justice. I used to have three dogs. The oldest needed a daily pill so every night around 9pm I would cut up a hot dog in chunks and cut a slit in one to put the pill into. Of course the other two dogs *also* had to have a hot dog chunk. I eventually lost the older dog when he was 14-1/2, but I kept giving the other two dogs pieces of hot dogs every night at 9pm because they expected it.    So then I got a puppy near the end of January, and I was giving all three dogs pieces of hot dog around 9pm. But in early February one of my older dogs passed away, and then at the end of July I lost the other one. It's been a very difficult couple years. But every night my puppy gets some pieces of hot dog around 9pm and I think about my old boys.  **EDIT**     Wow, I *never* expected my little story to blow up like this. Thanks everyone! For anyone who may be interested, here are some photos of my late boys:     [Joshua, my first dog, on his 14th birthday](https://i.imgur.com/9f1fhGg.jpg). He died about 6 months later, Nov 29, 2016. This is the dog who actually *needed* to take a pill!       [This is Buddy and new puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/DgeBj6T.jpg), at the end of January. Buddy passed away from kidney failure three days after this photo. Poor Jericho only got to know him for a few days but adored him, and for several days after Buddy passed Jericho would sleep in the spot where Buddy always slept.     [Harlan with puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/om5uDhM.jpg). We lost Harlan 6 months later at the end of July due to bone cancer in the leg. Jericho was very fond of Harlan, too.     Poor Jericho loved both his big brothers and now he's an only child. And a big one, I don't have a current picture but he turned 9 months old a couple weeks ago and weighed in at 94 lbs!

The first dog can smell that the other one didn't get the ear stuff. It knows the other dog got bamboozled
Where the fuck do you find dogs that are willing to take ear medicine like that? I had to chase my cocker spaniel all over the house to catch him for his ear meds, and it took two of us to hold him in place to administer it.
Just as adorable is OP's "squirt, squirt, squirt" when applying the second medicine.
All three of my dogs come for medication time. Only one gets meds but they all get cheese
Its important to them to be treated equally. Its in the doggy bill of rights.
Labs are such teddy bears. So sweet and happy
Parenting Done Right 😍
The way that man's face instantly goes from super serious man handling medicine to mischievous 5y/o is amazing!
I bet that guy is a great dad
awwww. i never comment on pet things. but awwww.
Oh wow!  I almost have to sit on my dog to put his ear medication in. I’ve tried everything and it’s still a huge battle.
That's the cutest thing ever, and I can't share it through text thanks to Reddit's player. :\
my name is dogbut cannot hearonce everydayput drop in ear  my doggy frendoes not need medbut still want dropto rub his head
So adorable! " squirt squirt squirt ".
Oh my goodness! I thought my younger dog might be the only one who was pretty sure she also needed medication (eye drops) when the older one did.   I also had to put the lid on and pretend to drop some in her eyes, as well as make a big deal over what a good girl she was, too.  It may have also had something to do with the fact that she might have worried without the "drops" she might get a good girl cookie as well.  Dogs never cease to amaze me.
My old buddy had lots of problems with his floppy ears and had to have ear medicine sometimes. He hated it. But he knew it helped. So whenever we see him scratching his ear too much we'll get up and grab the bottle. He'll run off and keep the dining table between him and me. After a few minutes he'll come up to me and sit. Once I squirt the medicine in and do some massage he'll run off and do some zoomies, roll around on his bed and make these adorable frustrated noises. Finally he'd come back and demand treats for being a good boy.But he would feel much better the next day
The second knows he doesn’t need medicine. What he needs is them sweet sweet ear rubs.
i am dog onewith ear that hurtsmy daddy givesthe little squirtsam second dogmy ear is finei want the squirts -please, dad, do mine!we lucky dogswith Loving dad -Best Medicinewe ever had!
Omg. This is too good
I had a really bad day personally and professionally and i really needed to smile. Thank you OP ❤️
This is so awesome! I am in love with this man for humoring this dog with the "squirt squirt squirt". This kind of thing speaks to someone's character, that he is willing to make that little gesture to acknowledge and appease this dogs quirky need to get the ear drops. Kudos to him!
This just reminded me of something I had forgotten about. My grandpa used to give my grandma eye drops every day. When he would do that, their border collie would jump in the chair and wait for her turn. He'd put the cap on the bottle and pretend to put drops her eyes while she tilted her head back. This was 15+ years ago, and they've all passed away now. Thank you for reminding me of that memory.
Big, goofy Labs are the best. I like how Dog #1 (Katie?) returned to make sure Dog #2 (Josh?) wasn't getting anything special on the down low, and Dog #2 is simply happy to be there for the ear rubs.The owner's great, too. "Squirt, squirt, squirt... all done!"/wigglebutts intensify
Nawww he is just fakin and wants some ear scratches. lol
That is one great dog dad.
1st dog- "you know he bamboozled you, right?"  2nd dog- "doesn't matter, got scritches"  They both just seem happy to be involved, lol
God I love that shit eating grin as he rubs the second dog's ears. Good dad.
The second dog gets up like "Huzzah! I am cured!!!"I've died of happiness.
I think he's just doing it for the ear rubs. Smart doggo.
Haha! I love the sound effects! “Squirt, squirt, squirt”
HECKIN GOOD BOIS 10/10 WOULD BOOP
The look on the man's face, and the satisfaction of equality on the dogs is priceless (especially since he got TWICE the dose. Tsk tsk!).
I totally believe this.My mom’s dog once needed eye drops. I watched her administer them and then she pretended to give them to other pup. I laughed and asked her why she does this and she explained he gets upset because he feels left out.
I used to have to give my Welsh Springer Spaniel haircuts every summer, and I’d finish shaving her then dutifully “shave” my black lab who had so patiently waited for her turn and was seething with jealousy.
My dog needs ear medication and I chase him for 30 minutes trying to put the stuff in his ears. These are good dogs
“Omg it worked, I tricked him, I got petted” 🐶
Aww and Dad plays along
That is so fucking adorable
That good boi is no dummy.  He gets ear skritches too!
Why can’t humans be as good as dogs
It's like toddler rules but with dogs
Adorable.   I lost my best mate Aibo (12 yr Lab ret) earlier this year. I miss him everyday. Miss ya buddy 🌹
Aw! What a great dad!
This is the best thing I've seen all day I love this
Same with my labs. One gets pain meds for her hips and everyone gets "medicine" (totally just balled up cheese).
Awe, I have a chocolate lab and a Habanesse. The lab has ear medicine and hates it so whenever I give it to him the small one starts licking his ears because he thinks he’s in pain lol too cute
We have a dog who needs eyedrops and another who doesn’t.During medication time, dog 1 gets eyedrops then dog 2 watches and asks for some.Once dog 1 is done, we hold dog 2 in position for receiving eyedrops. We then touch the bottom of the vial to the top of her head and she’s happy and believes she’s received her medication.
My dog does the same thing. One has to have a skin treatment nightly. He hates it. Even though the first dog fusses and squirms through the whole thing, my other dog comes and parks it right in front of me as soon as the first dog leaves. I just rub her skin like I do his, pat her butt, and call her a good girl.
The level of trust from the dogs is just amazing.Back when my dog had diabetes, he trusted us so much, and when it came to insulin, he would lay down for the shot when it was that time of the day.He was such a good boy, sure do miss him.
The first dog came back around and took a few sniffs and called bullshit on the con job.
I love animals so goddamn much.
The old man trying to hold back his smile is so endearing.  What good dogs and a good owner, you can tell they are loved.
This is so fucking adorable I can’t even stand it. As an animal nurse, that is not just one but two polite doggies. Good boyes alert!
He puts his hands up, that's how you know it's legit.
Everyday I see more and more proof of dogs being the silliest and goofiest and most innocent and most loving creatures 🙂
Oh my gosh! My mom does the same thing with her two little dogs. One needs medicine, and then the other she has to fake put drops in, “Boop Boop Boop!” And then he runs off and shakes his head like he actually got them put in. He’s reacting to fake drops!
I have been in a grumpy mood since coming from work but this wee clip really made me smile
Love the dogs and the Guy !
I wish i had a dad like those dogs have.
Such a good girl and good boy Awwwwh
Omg I miss my dog so much. I'm on a business trip and had a nightmare about my dog.
I have a cat like this. He sits there and watches us with his head tilted while we give medicine to one cat and then he waits patiently for us to pick him up and give it to him as well.
I wish my dogs sat there for ear medicine, I have to wrestle my basset hound to the ground and sit on her to give her meds.
I had two dogs. An old one that needed medication and a young one that didn't. We'd give them both "medicine" every morning and evening (the old one would get actual medicine, the young one would get a small treat)  The older one has been gone 5 years, the younger one still with us still expects "medicine" you can't call it a treat or he won't take it. Has to be called "medicine"
My dog can't be quiet when he sees me putting make up on and I don't pretend to put some on him too.
You must be mistaken. That's not medicine. That's EAR TREATS.
My dogs are like this. They don't like being brushed or getting their nails clipped individually but if the two of them are together they fight for the privilege.
When you give your younger sibiling an unplugged controller so he can "play" games with you.
How sweet is that!
My mom's puppy has severe hip dysplasia (German Shepherd and mastiff(?) mix) and he had surgery at 9 months old to fix it. After his surgery he was limping and getting pain meds. My dog, being the princess she is, was jealous of all the attention the puppy was getting, so she lifted one of her paws and limped around the house to make us think she was hurt too. We knew she was full of bull because she's done this before AND forgets what paw she 'injured'. Also whenever one of our dogs needs a pill, everybody gets a treat because otherwise they get jealous. And my mom used to own a grumpy old Collie who was smart enough to know when he was getting medication and would eat the treat and spit out the pill, so we would give all the dogs a treat to fool him into thinking it was treats time instead of pill time. Actually worked pretty well! He's been gone for 3 years now but we still do that with all our dogs whenever one needs medicine.BTW: the puppy is 1 year 3 months and he's doing great. He's finally acting like a silly crazy puppy now that he's not in pain anymore. He thinks my brother's lab/ pit mix is his mom, even though she's half his size.
Kinda like having kids no? 😂
Squirt, Squirt, Squirt. :D
All doggo knows is their frien is getting earrubz, and wants earrubz too. I don't blame him.
Solitary. I've never commented in r/awe, but that is some cute stuff right there.
Dang. My dogs all run when they see that little bottle.
So pure.
Brilliant. My dogs will run and hide when I bring out the meds. I guess it's all about the technique. You make it really worth it with that massive ear massage
This is beautiful
r/likeus
nothing is a bigger deal to my dog than ear meds, holy jeez she goes nuts (Golden retriever)
Jesus christ. Reddit video is horrendous. The only video platform that takes 30 seconds to play and then pauses in the middle. USE GFYCAT.
My pup has problems with ear infections so we regularly need to squirt a solution in his ears to keep them clean and healthy. I wish it was this easy with him! Nothing but a battle as he tries to get away. I don’t blame him though, I wouldn’t want someone squirting shit into my ears on a regular basis either.
The way he said "All done" hahaha
First time I actually said aww outloud
Such a GOOD BOI!
If this was on YouTube, there would be a DMCA takedown request for the TV playing in the background.
That’s has to be the cutest video to date. Seriously. This takes the cake.
I wish my dog was like that. It was like trying to ride an unwilling horse through the house last night putting his drops in.
This is a man with a good heart in this video.
It's like toddler rules but with dogs
AWWDUNN
Can’t get over Dad lookin around trying to hold in his laughter.
This is like when one of my dogs gets wet and gets toweled off the dry dog comes over to be toweled too.
I love dogs.... seriously the best thing mankind has done, taming wild dogs.....
What beautiful intuitive creatures. They love their person and just want to know he loves them back. Pure love.
Today I bought a present for a 4 year old... and threw in something for his older brother.  Feels like the same thing.
Gotta love a big sweet Lab.
This is ridiculously sweet. The father human's smile makes it for me.
I love this video so much. Especially when the guys throws his hands up and says ALL DONE
Equal rights for all pups
That man was being adorableEdit: I also love how dogs or animals can expect attention by sitting still and close, not looking directly at you or facing you but giving glances kind of awkwardly.. just waiting for their turn at affection
Nothing better than Labs !  So sweet
One of my friends had a German Shepard, when he was about eight years old my friend got a new German Shepard pup.  The older one was grazed by a car and had a slight limp but he was ok.  Soon the pup started limping too with the same back leg.  My friend took the pup to the vet to get him checked out but the vet said he was fine, nothing wrong.  So this new pup was just learning to limp because of the other dog.
That smile from the human is fucking heart meltingso genuine and free
Oh dogs ❤️

My pup gets so mad that he doesn’t get insulin shots like his diabetic brother twice a day 🙄
I had a dog that needed a shot of insulin 2x a day. I always gave them to her right as she started eating. The other dog wouldn't eat unless she got a shot too, so I used a syringe that hadn't been used and with the top on, pretended to get her medicine too. She then ate real good. After my older one passed away, the other dog to this day will not eat unless she gets her medicine. Give her her shot and she'll eat, otherwise she'll sit and stare at you until she gets it...so silly.
There is something actually really beautiful about this
He thinkin bout them pets
“Squirt squirt squirt”... Is he trying to fool the dog or himself?
I cannot upvote this enough. Warmed my cockles.
That’s the cutest thing I’ve seen all day.
Labs are so adorable, I just can’t
all better now!!
the best <3
I actually had to do that last week. My other pup was so upset that she didn’t get “ear rubs” too
That is so cute. What good doggos
Protect doggos at all costs
My past few days have been weird and this was the most adorable thing I've seen.
Never seen anything cuter.
This is the cutest thing
JESUS MY HEART
THESE DOGS ARE SO WELL BEHAVED
The excited wagging of the tail gets me every time
My dog need to have ear medication when my sisters dog was visiting. My dog hates having her ears cleaned and my sisters dog needed to have medication for his ears before, so when he saw me giving my dog the stuff he ran and hid.
DOGS!!
My lab runs under the table when I take out the ear meds.  I have to take out the peanut butter and he knows that he only gets the PB if he lets me give him the ear meds.
Anything for ear rubs.
My doxie boi Frank the Tank just had back surgery last week. I have another doxie that thinks he need to do physical therapy after I finish with Frank. It’s hysterical!https://i.imgur.com/u7TYGn8.jpg there they are!
I dont care about the drugs, i just want the hugs
Those dogs suit that owner as far as the owners look like their pets thing.
I wish i had a dad like those dogs have.
Well that’s nice. Mine looks at me like I’m going to murder her when I bust out the ear drops.
I have to clean my cat’s ear daily, followed by a treat for being a good boy.Recently got a kitten and he wants treats too, so he also get’s a q-tip on the outside of his ear canal, he’s calm and quiet for them treats.
Man, my dog needed medicine like this - we had to double team, one person holding treats the other doing the ear thing.
me when I want to feel included
Such a brave strong doggo
This absolutely made my day.
Vote for best dog owner!
I love this. Dogs are the best
Perfect.
The second dog has you bamboozled for free ear rubs and you think he's the one who's bamboozled??? He's one step ahead. If anyone's bamboozled, it's definitely you. Bamboozled.
I wish my dog took his ear meds that well!!! The minute   It comes out he try’s to hide his head in the couch or beneath his blanket. And lord help us if he sees the wash and the cleaner sticks come out!
I wish my dog was that good at taking ear medicine 😭😭😭
This is absolutely adorable.  <3  On a serious note though, I just wanted to warn everyone that some ear treatment antibiotics can cause irreversible hearing damage in your dogs.  We took our Bull Terrier in about 6 months ago because she had sudden hearing loss only to find out the veterinarian who we saw her the appointment before prescribed an ointment for a "possible" ear infection that wasn't necessary in the first place.  Our dog's actual problem was ruptured ear drums, not sure why or how it happened, and the ointment went into the holes, got infected and caused her to go deaf.  We tried general anesthesia and a cleaning treatment to get some hearing back, but it failed.  Before a vet gives you ear treatment, have them check the eardrum.  We did it for years with multiple dogs and never had an issue, but it only took one time to change her life forever.You can read about other instances online if you're interested.
I did it all for the scritches..
this is so cute
Lol, the second dog reminds me of Michael Scott
My guys did the exact same thing when one of them needed eye drops!  I had to fake giving eye drops to the other one.
Look at him stoickly waiting. Goodboye means business .
Where's the person with the poem?
We don’t deserve dogs 😭
Placeboggo
We really don't deserve dogs, too pure!
My dog does this every time too! It just melts my heart.
Hahaha cute
My dogs growing up did this! Of course they were labs
Dogs are the best
This is ADORABLE! He waits so patently for his turn.
+1 goodboy point
What a great pet owner!!
Very sweet. Both the dogs and their owner!
So cute it made my day...
This is the most Labrador thing I’ve ever seen
Oh man. This brought back nightmares. We had a 17.5 lb old tomcat that was formerly feral as a pet. He had ear wax problems so got ear infections a few times. I recall working up a sweat and having my muscles be sore the next morning wrestling him with my partner to keep him down to even get a bit of a squirt in an ear. Its amazing what a defense an under 20lb animal can put up
Seriously how lucky are we to have dogs in our lives. I love them so much.
Why are dogs so much better than humans?
Haha reminds me of one of my pups. We have an (almost) 8 year old Bernese and a rescue berner we adopted a few years ago. The rescue has a bunch of health issues and always needs something new. For example, we got her a food bowl shaped like a maze because she used to eat extremely fast when we fed her. My other dog just HAD to try out her bowl. She was infatuated with it. Now she's having leg problems and got a new harness that helps us lift her back end up so she can walk easier. Other pup just HAD to try it out. She's a character... Just can't have something new without her being in on it.
This was me with middle child syndrome! Lol. But not as cute!
“All done!” The best part haha
As a vet, this is actually the best animal video I have ever seen.Absolute gold.
He just wants special ear petting too.
It's because dogs get endorphin pumps from ear rubs. Peddling cuteness for affection.....dirty, rotten, scoundrels.
Are dogs even human?
Dogs are about the best beings on earth.
When my dog smell me grabbing the bottle she hide under the table. She hate that stuff
What's the ear medicine for anyways?
ALL DOONNE! Everyone involved is so cute!
Every time I send home ear meds, I'm going to hope this is what goes on.
It felt like the doggy wanted the ear rub and not the medicine part
I wish my cats were this easy to give medicine too! Rather than cue up, they run off to the four corners of the earth. 😕
Good dogs :)
What a sweet man
scammed
lmao I never thought this could happen cuz whenever I'm dealing with an animal the others suddenly disappear off the face of the earth 🤣
Dogs are just the purest creatures on this planet.
That's one of the cutest things I've ever seen.
Can somebody explain to me what war medicine is? I know very little about ears so my knowledge is that they come in 4 states: can hear everything, can hear everything with hearing aids, can hear  an annoying constant ringing, and can’t hear anything. This is all based on human ears so if this is a dog specific thing, I’d love to know why they have ear medicine.
I want to marry that guy!
My turn my turn!
I just found out how much better it is with sound! :)
My mom's puppy has severe hip dysplasia (German Shepherd and mastiff(?) mix) and he had surgery at 9 months old to fix it. After his surgery he was limping and getting pain meds. My dog, being the princess she is, was jealous of all the attention the puppy was getting, so she lifted one of her paws and limped around the house to make us think she was hurt too. We knew she was full of bull because she's done this before AND forgets what paw she 'injured'. Also whenever one of our dogs needs a pill, everybody gets a treat because otherwise they get jealous. And my mom used to own a grumpy old Collie who was smart enough to know when he was getting medication and would eat the treat and spit out the pill, so we would give all the dogs a treat to fool him into thinking it was treats time instead of pill time. Actually worked pretty well! He's been gone for 3 years now but we still do that with all our dogs whenever one needs medicine.BTW: the puppy is 1 year 3 months and he's doing great. He's finally acting like a silly crazy puppy now that he's not in pain anymore. He thinks my brother's lab/ pit mix is his mom, even though she's half his size.
I heard some where that ears rubbing is like sex massage for dog
Good on everyone to play along!
Dogs are the cutest creatures.
Wow dogs really are the best. 😭
>Squirt squirt squirt>Squirt squirt squirt>ALL DONEMy girlfriend takes it with as much enthusiasm.
That dog is after the ear rubs. The medicine ain't got nothing to do with it.
Amazing.
He just wants dem ear scratches.
The second dog is just in it for the scritches. He knows there’s no medicine.
We dont deserve dogs
Awww!! 😭
Awww :')
Fucking adorable
I wish our lab behaved half that well while we put his ear medicine in.
This was so sweet!!
I suddenly want two giant yellow labs.
So wholesome!
Such a golden retriever thing to do, I love them.
And over here, I can't get either one of my two ear-problem-pups to sit still. I end up tasting it every time, as they fling the crap everywhere from shaking their heads before I can take my hand away.
GIVE ME BELLY RUBS OR GIVE ME TREATS!!
Eff I can't even get my dog to sit still for a second so I can put the darn drops in his ears. You know it's a struggle when not even a treat is of help.
ALL DONE
Doggy cargo cult.
Labs ears need constant cleaning.
So sweet... like little children
That bud got easily fooled.
I wish it was this easy to treat my dogs ears instead of having a wrestle match with her.
hes just in it for the scritches
Awe good man still pretending to put the drops in and made his cute doggo so happy! :)
Lol my turn
Brett Favre?
Aww my god!
I understand.  we had a much loved chihuahua who got pretend ear drops, pretend pills, baths when he didn't need one, etc.
Totally sweet!
That smirk on his face says it all
One of my kittens has a broken leg.  To make him feel good we have to keep them both together in the pen at night.  They get used to the routine.
That is too cute!
That actually made me saw awww out loud.
Hahahahah
this is the cutest thing i’ve seen today :)
I love this.
Lol I remember when my rott had a eye infection and my lab got so jealous that he start hitting her ears for no reason lol
Munchausens by puppy?
This is the best thing I've seen on the internet in a while. So precious!
What a good daddy!!
Like a fucken child! Omg, so adorable!
Because he's a good boy, obviously.
Ok ok, MY turn hooman...
Mine does this too!
The meaning of friendship
What’s fur is fur.
My dog hated his ear meds. The dude ran for the hills once he saw the bottle.
All fixed!!! Love this! Thanks OP I needed this today!
OK that's adorable
I think it comes down to attention. I have a cat that requires asthmatic medication and the other one always wonders why I seek her out specifically.
Haha our Bassetts are like that too!
The dog's thinking, those are funny squirt noises
Dog low key just wants it’s ears rubbed
My rotty, RIP, would love to have her ears cleaned and medicated. She constantly had ear infections every other year.
He just wanted those sweet ear rubs.
Aww, she just wants some attention too. So sweet.
How come he was patiently waiting for his turn. My dog does not even stay still for the ear medicine!
Awww! I walk a lab and he's needs ear drops at the moment too. I wish he was as calm about it as this dude! He loves it when I rub his ears though, as the yeast infection he has makes them super itchy.
My turn, my turn!!
/r/woof_irl
My god you are so lucky she stays still!!! Impossible with my guy.
THE BEST
This. This is why I’m studying to become a vet tech.
 how cute.  I was never able to get one ear treated, and especially had no chance to treat the second
A Team
Pupper just wanted an ear massage. Dogs love them. I give them to my pups regularly.
I love the “squirt squirt squirt” effect 🤗☺️
I have to do the same with my dogs whenever one has to take medicine.
Omg, too freakin cute...God love em
I wish my boi would behave like that for his ear drops....
Good humans are sure to love their animals equally.
Mometamax.
Your dads face is priceless, he knows he’s fooling the pup and is absolutely enjoying it lol
Baby ear medicine!
Swears that’s like me and my sister. If I had something my sister had to have it too lol
Doggo also wants the pats
God I love dogs.
This is the best thing I saw on Reddit today! Please post more of these two.
He’s just there for the ear rubs :)
Dad should put a drop or two in one ear one time so you can record pupper's surprised reaction.
So cute
That guy is awesome.
Nah he just wants the ear massage
Ggk
I freaking love animals.
All dogs are created equal was the first statement in the Doglaration of Independence,.
Little does anyone know he’s only doing it for the ear scritches!
Are we all really about to act like that good boye didn't know exactly what he was doing?He just wanted the scritches, and knows that cuteness cuts straight to our hearts.
My dog does this when I give my kids their meds. He wants meds too.
Omg that is too cute!!
Oh my goodness, that was too adorable! What a good boy ♥️
All the other dog wants is to get the same amount of attention, basically. Adorable little attention hogs.
Lol! He’s just in it for the massage.
This is not my dogs. They’d smell that medicine and run and hide. Ear rubs be damned!
The things that parents do for their children....or it could just be that the other dog wants an ear rub and attention also? Either way, the deal or pact between owner and dog is really cute and funny!
I’m saving this post because it makes me feel all fuzzy.
Too pure
One of my dog is on CBD and the other one just wants what her big brother have. So now I have 2 dogs on CBD!
My dog loves getting his Mometamax when he needs it. Its super soothing for them.
My dog would whine and hide when he needed ear drops...he HATED them. He would tuck himself under the coffee table so we couldn't get to his ears.
Thank you for treating them equally!!!
It's all about the ear rubs afterwards.
I give little white dog her pills in  a  bit of peanut butter, little brown dog also gets peanut butter at the same time.  Getting him in the habit in case he needs pills some day.
I love the fact he pretended for him..awww
dogs are just the best!
My aunt's dogs are this way with insulin shots. One of them is going blind and needs insulin for diabetes and the other doesn't, but has always been very close to his brother so after one gets the shot, my aunt pretend pokes him too every single day. Ra so sweet!
Or he's just here for the massage.
This is so stinking adorable I LOVE yellow labs.  My girl is a scratch addict so if anyone is getting attention she gets jealous.  She tries to push my youngest out of the way when I am getting him dressed.
Golden retrievers <3
She just wants an ear rub
What a good doggy dad! :D
Free ear rubs!
 Dogs cure allergies.
Our dog did this also when I had to put ear drops in our other dog's ear. I guess it made her feel special because she would wiggle her butt and jump around afterward. She's a weird dog though, the only time she wants human food is if we have pumpkin pie.
That is the best human.
Just like a sibling
Meanwhile I have to literally fight my dog just to clean his ears.
Dog Dad rocks!
This kind of happens with my dogs. My elderly dog is on an arthritis pill and so she gets it in a ball of bread every morning. My other dog will pout if he doesn't get a ball of bread as well.
We used to have one dog that needed to be shaved and another dog that shed so no shaving necessary.  Any time we would shave the one dog we would have to lay the clippers on the back of the other one and turn them on so he felt like he was getting shaved too.
This makes me happy.
"Squirt. Squirt. Squirt."
This is so cute
This made my day. 💚
This put a huge smile on my face! You can tell how much they love him. Those are some lucky pups, and a lucky dude!
Bork bless these golden ones.
Is that a Posatex bottle I see?? Ah labs and ear infections lol
Dogs are so amazing.
Nah he just wanted the ear rub.
I wish my lab was this calm when I give him ear medicine
Such beautiful animals.
Oh yeah that's a feels good, man.
This is so adorable
What a sweet and patient doggy daddy.
Damn, my dogs run in the other direction
Dogs are the best !!
I have to use that medicine on my dog too and he hates it. He literally cringes when I pull it out but I think he knows it makes his ears stop itching.
The best part is the dog-dad giving that lippy look to the camera, his eyes are just screaming "Make sure you get this part"
I want an ear massage now.
Good boy is just here for the ear rubs.
I think the other dog just wants extra ear scritches
This is adorable!!
Well, yeah. Looks like the first doggo got a nice ear rub. Gotta get that ear massage.
Golden retrievers!!! Is there a sub for this?
awwww so cute 😍
Just so pure :')
successfully done :'D
I'm impressed they sit still for that.
Omg my dog and I used to play chase around my house anytime I had to put medicine in her ears. It was always a huge struggle. I miss her dearly.
Little Cesar's!
Labs are precious 😭
This is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen
goddamn is that cute!!!
u/bigblue026
Wholesome.
So cute!!!! I love it!
Me too, me too !
THIS IS SO CUTE ❤️
The goodest of boys
That background commercial sounds like something from rick and Morty
Can I be next?
"That looks good. I'll have what he's having."
My dog used to like getting his ear meds, but, I think he liked the ear massage, he was always licking his chops when we'd rub his ears. This is part of the reason I love dogs, they're so cute.
Mometamax or posatex? I can tell by the bottle. I still haven't figured out if that's a good thing or not.
I wish my dog wanted his ear medicine!  He has to be pinned down.
Sooo cute!!
That’s just adorable!
Roofus you make such a big deal about the ear medicine but I can’t even feel them and it only takes a few seconds. Stop being a big baby.
That’s absolutely fucking adorable
And to think that some people hate dogs?? I would drive a school bus full of dogs back and forth from the east coast to the west coast everyday!
Skooert skooert skooert
What does the ear medicine do?
I freaking love labrador retrievers, especially 2!
Gazibo affect
This is so wholesome.
Hahaha if he gets it, I want it also !
Jokes on you he just wants an ear massage !
Are those yellow labs?
right on!
This warms my heart so much.
This is wholesome 😊
Isn't it amazing how much dogs trust us?
Nice try Little Caesars Pizza!
One of mine gets peanut butter with a pill each morning. The other one also has the peanut butter but without the pill just so she won’t cause a stick about it. Can’t miss out on anything...
Yo,  I have that same peanuts blanket
And a spoonful of ear scratchies.
He came for the head scratches
The dog version of a hand job.  He wants it whether he needs it or not.
Dog say. Haha he fell for it. I just wanted a rub
One of my dogs has allergies so I give her a pill in cheese. When I adopted my second dog our cheese bill doubled.
Thank you for making my day! This is too cute.
Shes stealing ear rubs!
LOL we have to do the same thing!
How sweet is that!
Squirt Squirt Squirt
Precious! 😍❤️😍❤️😍
Thats a good dad
Dogs are the best
So cute
This literally made my daughter cry.
Cuuute!!! All better!!
no he clearly just wants the ear massage
This made my heart full
We don’t deserve dogs.
Hahaha, that second one is like:"... I see dem scritches you givin' out. Don't be coy now son"
Labs are the best. And my Dakota was the bestest girl so she even earned herself a tattoo
Love this
Labs and ear infections....it's the most common ailment for them.
Indeed, a couple of good bois
So cute! This guy reminds me of my dad. He would totally do something like this.
 8kAnd zzzz GB  m
That feeling when you’re ears are rubbed
I love the smirk on the guy as he does it. Dogs are so precious.
Ll
this absolutely melted my heart
My dog throws a damn tantrum when it's time for his eye and ear drops
I was having a super shitty day today and this just made my day, thank you OP
He is just trolling bro
OmgI had to do this with both my dogs too lmfao
Ear rub hustle level: placebo.
My dogs do this and I love them for it.
Can’t stop giggling because this whole video is so cute :3 haha
Im gonna assume the dog just wants the ear rubs
He's just in it for the ear rubs.
Very very good goldens
i love this!! thanks for sharing
the dog probably just wanted the ear rubs
The other one is cured too !
Check this kids out on Instagram @a.b.e._creations

That's SO adorable!

What brand is this dog.Edit:breed
Each time I brought home my 3 newborn sons a couple years apart, my big, tough and rough beast of a Rottweiler would sit next to the baby for weeks just standing guard and staring, alerting us with each noise or movement. He was normally very obedient, but when baby toes were in the house, no matter what we did, he could not resist incessantly licking those toes when we weren’t looking. He looked so guilty but couldn’t stop himself. We finally gave up and the babies loved it. He died 4 years ago and I still cry sometimes missing him so much.
I don't know who's tomato this is but it's cute and I want it.
*Just what I always wanted. My own little human! I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him...*
man that is so sweet. dogs get it: tiny, vulnerable, i will be gentle and help you protect it, promise!!!!
Dog got a little stressed out just for not looking at the baby for a quick second. I fear great separation anxiety when this one leaves to elementary school 😂
I think most dogs are super aware of what the deal with human pups is right away. I've read threads before about expecting moms who swear their dogs could tell they were pregnant even before they took a test. I like to think this doggo already knew and was waiting/ excited to see the brand new human.
"Grow up quick hooman....Need someone to throw the ball"
She's like "Idk what this thing is but if anybody tried to hurt it, I'd murder them."
We had a husky when my eldest was born. She really loved pears, we gave her one a few days after bringing the baby home and instead of her usual manic devouring of the pear she gently placed it under the basket where my daughter was taking a nap.
I wonder what dogs think of the new baby scent.  To them, I imagine it being something like this: Owner 1 scent + Owner 2 scent = New Baby scent?  MUST LOVE NEW BABY IT SMELLS LIKE TWO OWNERS IN ONE!
"*MY* baby!"
I love my dog a lot, he's a pitbull terrier, except I feel like he's too much of an animal to be allowed so close to a baby. I just have trust issues.
"this thing is gonna drop *SO MUCH* food for me over the next couple of years..."
"Human small, I protect."
Oh! That is so so so sweet. I  hope my 3 cats fall in love with my lil boy. Find out in 11 weeks!
[deleted]
This is the thing to do with dogs.  Don't leave them unsupervised with a baby but make them feel loved and welcomed and that nothing has changed for them except that noisy creature you brought home. I feel that most dogs in a good, happy, safe home are quite happy to allow new members into their family as long as they are not suddenly made to feel like second class citizens in their own homes.  Dogs, I think, need to be treated very much like older siblings when a baby comes home.  Mommy and Daddy still love you very much and you are a good boy :)
This makes me so happy and sad at the same time.My wife and I had the same moment with our twins and dog, she loved them and was always around for playtime and to be a pillow for them to sleep on, she would give them kisses when they cried and watch over them while they slept.But unfortunately as she aged the vets believe she got severe early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, she began acting erractic and bit both of my twins so bad we had to take them to the hospital and because of this we had to put her down but when I went to see her at the vet after the rabies tests were done on the day we were to put her to sleep she was her normal self, happy to see me and jumping and I help her close is my arms as she licked me one last time and I cried into her as she stuck her tongue out when she fell asleep for the last time.I miss my dog and these moments and I'm sorry if this comment isnt meant for here but I miss her and I just wanted to talk about her one more time and tell people that she was a good girl.Edit to my comment: My apologise for just putting a sad story and not following up with some positivity!Also to follow up, she was in quarantine for 7 days, which I thought meant they were running tests, I guess they removed her brain after she was put to sleep. My apologies for not making that clearer.As for happy, she used to go into my boys rooms at 8 am every day and sniff their feet until they woke up, it got to the point where they started getting up and waiting for her. She would also just follow then around while they scooted around on their little 4 wheel baby scooters and chase them down, when they would stop and turn around she would look at them and then run away and wait for them to chase her.
You gonna finish that or...?
I’ll be a downer too, but it seems like this dog is a bit anxious. Whale eye, little tongue flicks, all signs of anxiety. That being said, hopefully it’s just that these parents know their dog better than anybody and I’m wrong. :) It took my pup a little while to completely be comfortable with my baby around and we made sure to have only supervised, positive interactions/associations between the two. Two years in, they’re total bros now (and still always supervised).
Funny. My parents always told me when I was a wee baby that I could never be left alone with our husky because he would try and drag me around and nibble on me like a chew toy. As soon as I got bigger than him though he seemed to learn his place and we got along famously.
Hmm or maybe jealous of baby and just getting as close to possible to the owner.
Idk dog looks kind of stressed/nervous - lip lick, whale eye, side glance, ear tuck... Probably going to be downvoted to oblivion because baby + dog how could someone say no?! But here’s a link that has some of the behaviors summed up https://positively.com/dog-training/understanding-dogs/canine-body-language/ I’m not saying baby and dog is world shattering bad btw, just that it’s not as “aww adorable look how happy the doggie is” as we anthropomorphize it to be
Pediatrician here. I don't care who your dog is, this is fucking stupid.Source: have seen it multiple times
[deleted]
Aren't you worried the dog will bite the babys face or something? this just seems dangerous to me
[reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTaEJMKc7Lw)
This dog is showing quite a few stress signals here. Doesn't necessarily mean impending doom, but if I was that mother I would be more cautious in the future with letting the dog that close. 1) the ears are pinned back, doesn't necessarily indicate fear, sometimes from excitement. Similiar to tail wagging. 2) lots of lip licking. Appeasement signal to ward off potential threat. 3) the dog makes "whale eyes", they are bulging a bit, then he looks away breaking eye contact. Maybe from a distraction hard to say.That dog is definitely uneasy and nervous. :( not really a good spot to be in for the dog or baby. I'm not saying this dog is a "baby killer" from a 5 second gif. But he doesn't seem comfortable with it. It's a pretty good example of how we tend to personify dogs, and don't realize they have body language that is very different from our own.
Never leave a new baby alone with a dog.  Tragedy can and does strike suddenly.
Yeah... That's really not what that dogs doing....it's showing anxiety and jealousy. It's trying to get as close to the mom as possible.
I am wolf dog. I will eat this tiny human later tonight.
she must be hungry
Either that or she's just really jealous.
I'm all for dogs, babies, and upvotes but there's been instances where dogs attack newborns. This is just one of them. http://abc13.com/police-identify-8-week-old-baby-killed-by-family-dogs/2329045/waiting for the downvotes to roll in
Hi, animal-noob here. I was wondering, how do we know one dog is perfectly safe to be so close to a baby (or our face) at a 99.9% probability?
I like dogs but I dnt trust them around babies. It's seems like I'm the only one lol.
[You shouldn't conduct the experiment using live subjects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvnJmN_yehw)
Our overactive daschound/jack russel terrier mutt never showed any interest in mini humans...till we brought ours home. The dog would not leave our son alone, had to be a nearby when we were holding him. He would also become very concerned at any squeak or cry that our son made. He would run to the bassinet, check on our son, run to find us, then follow us back to make sure everything was alright.
This whole comment section is a great example of how the majority of humans tend to anthropomorphize animals. In reality, animal instincts are very different. It really just looks like the dog is investigating with smell and gauging it's position in the pack with this new member. It's even putting it's head on the baby, like, "okay, so I'm still above the baby in rank.. nobody does anything when I rest on top of it."
Humans are terrible at reading dog body language. She’s licking her lips, ears back and wide eyes - she’s anxious and unhappy. The dog shouldn’t be put into this situation as clearly she is unsure how to act; this is not to insinuate she is going to harm the baby in any way - but she’s trying to tell you she’s uncomfortable.
Every year some kid dies because an idiot parent thinks their pet is different and would never attack their kid
I love dogs,  *love* them, but just please understand that they are still animals and they're unpredictable- my friends 5 month old kid was attacked by their dog last week when it had ZERO previous aggressive behavior and in fact is easily intimidated by their kitten. Totally unprovoked. We all love them. but they're still unpredictable.
DANGER DANGER DANGER! That dog is not super relaxed and comfortable and is showing a lot of body language of stress and conflict.
Or hungry
This is sweet, but people keep forgetting that dogs are animals. One wrong movement, sound or alarm, the dog snaps and the baby is left severely disfigured or worse, regardless of weather or not the dog understands how "precious" it is
To join the chorus of semi-negativity, I saw a gif that was on /r/funny titled something like “I think he was jealous,” where a dog owner was patting a stuffed dog in front of his real dog.  The actual dog sat there for a long while looking totally mellow until he just flipped out on the stuffed toy.  People in that thread were saying “Oh yea my dog would be totally jealous,"  yet here I see “It knows its a baby it totally wouldnt harm him.”There’s a few other comments in this thread that mention the dog looks somewhat anxious or is looking to gain the adults affection, and I tend to agree.  Either way, even if I knew the temperament of my own dog, I would still never ever letting it that close to a newborn.
My baby cousin has a huge scar on her face from someone doing this with a dog. Cool.
He just want to take a bite
My male husky knew when I was pregnant. He jumped up on everyone but stopped jumping on me once my belly was noticeable. He was also a loner but couldn’t sleep anywhere except under my babies’ crib. He loved kids and the smaller the better. Very loving breed.
Dogs just get it.
I feel like a curmudgeon when I say this, but I would never let a dog that close to a newborn like that, dogs got germs like everyone else and who knows if they'd paw at the baby as is their want
good boyo swer to protec smol hooman
one bite and its all over.
Seams pretty dangerous to have dog so close to the head.
Eh. As much as I appreciate the moment, it would be very hard for me to let any animal that close for too long. The most loyal of pets make small mistakes and with a newborn, completely not worth the risk. I'd wait until they were much older before introducing them to an animal.
'My dog doesn't bite!'
this makes me anxious
Just remember, however adorable they are, never leave the baby and dog alone together
Wish dog lifespan was like 100 years.
Aww that's so sweet. Dogs are wonderful. <3
Dis hooman is gonna get more luv than me?I is ok with it. Just save some luvs for me plz.
Everytime I see a dog this close to a little child I get so tense. You might know when a dog won't bite, but just because of an instinct, jealousy or whatever may happen, a bite would totally kill the kid...
Looks like the dog is about to take a bite lol
That baby’s in danger.
Ears back, lip licking, looking away, I don’t think it’s love
Is this normal cuz I usually hear story about dogs get jealousy of the new born baby and attack the baby
Why would you let a dog that close to a newborn baby?  Risks are high benefits low.
That's cute and all but I wouldn't let the dog be so close to the baby's face, tbh.  Animal lover but this made me nervous af. You never know with dogs, they could bite at it for a variety of reasons like one of their toys, etc.
This is not doggy love. That is dog asking what the hell is this. Is it food, is it play? Why r u showing over protection, human. This dog doesn't know what the baby is yet in the family's hierarchy.Let the downvotes begin :D
Years of being best friends await
Never doing that. I love dogs but nope...
Are there ever incidents of dogs biting infants as small as this one?
This gives me the chills, I feel that the dog could bite the baby any moment.
While I understand that people find this sweet... This is r/aww ... I can't help but get worried when I see things like this. No matter how much you'd like to embellish it, it remains that newborns are exceptionally fragile, and dogs are animals, not humans. They are unpredictable. No matter how well trained or good natured, I couldn't ever place my trust in an animal in that kind of way. You only have to glance at a newspaper to see that tragedy *can* strike. Just my opinion.
sister in laws husky but my niece in the face. I cringed when I saw OPs post.
I would never let a dog this close to a baby.
Ive said it before and Ill say it every time i see a post like this.Dogs are animals, its not worth the chance of having a babies face bitten off for the sake of a fuckin "aww" moment. Jesus christ people, stop thinking you know what animals think.
It's so sweet how she tries to be as gentle as possible around the baby.
I have a serious question. Human touch and any kind of germs around a new baby is super harmful, why do people let dogs around new borns or atleast like why this close? Is it not harmful?
My friends dog gives their newborn his toys to play fetch, while he’s sleeping. It’s the cutest thing. He’s gotta wait a few years for his future best bud to grow up first!
I'm totally not going to eat it when you walk away
That dog is clearly begging for dinner.
This is 100% the case with my pittie [Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/UqFfT) and my son.
*im just gonna put my nose right here okay*
The baby makes me want to downvote, the puppy makes me want to upvote. I guess I'll do nothing then.
Seriously wtf did humans do to deserve dogs. I'm totally convinced that if an apocalypse happened the higher beings/religious icons  (what ever you believe in) will save all dogs and leave us.
One thing that a lot of people aren't quite addressing is that dogs have played a very important role of keeping watch over human children for a long time. There are even nanny dogs that have specifically been bred for this purpose.
Imagine if it just bit right into the baby's skull.
Now I want a baby and a dog.
I thought it was more of an “Are you gonna eat that” look
"Are you gonna eat that?" - Dog, probably.
Do dogs know that babies are fragile creatures?
Dogs are so strange , mine is huge and could pull a large man off his feet , yet give him a rope toy and a kid and he will only pull enough so that it's fun , he knows just how much pressure to use when playing , the same when walking on a lead
'But, but, when do I eat it?'
Yea.. that's not what's happening here...
For the safety of both the baby and your dog, stop doing this.
'What can I do to help?'
My doggo growled at anyone who would touch my wife's pregnant belly. She never growled towards anyone like that before.Dogs know.
There's some good comments about dogs knowing and wanting to protect newborns. Also remember dogs can swing the otherway. Huskeys especially have been known to kill many small things and even attack younger children, even though they might seem to be the nicest dog in the world. We can only guess the dynamic that the dog thinks it's in (i.e the owners are the alpha). Not always the case. Just be cautious introducing new things to the pack.Congratulations though. Super cute dog and baby!Edit: typo
❤️❤️❤️
When she looks at the camera, I'm half convinced she's a porg
That’s her baby now. Supervised visits only.
Do dogs have an understanding of other species offspring? I just think it's neat how some dogs will protect your children. And other animals will eat them immediately.
Millie is such a sweet dodge
This human is too small, must observe for further growth Edit: Spelling, for I am dumb human
More likely she just wants to smell new tiny human
She's high on human!
That little munchkin tasted dog breath for the first time. You can see the reaction. They'll make great friends.
"got any games?"
"Welcome to the pack"
Doggos are too good for us
She looks so much like my puppy!
It’s an evolutionary trait that babies of any species are cute. It is protection, although it doesn’t always work. I recently watched a documentary where a male lion came and killed a bunch of cubs from a different father. He wanted to mate with the mother so those cubs had to go.
We don't deserve dogs ! So precious...
I wonder if dogs smell or react to the oxytocin?
I thought it was an avocado in the thumbnail
Animals are so fucking amazing
amazing
The baby is like "Hey brah, stop touching  me."
Germs though?
Really cute baby and I love your pet as well. Both look charming.
Aah what a sweet, sweet doggo. I love dogs so much.
I rember reading that dogs literraly feel in love with their people. Just big balls of fur and love.
They'll be causing trouble together before you know it, congratulations & enjoy!
The look of tenderness in that dog is incredible.  And I don't mean it's meat you peckerwoods.
WhY hE sO sMoL?
I'm in love with this gif.
My favorite thing to do with posts like this is sort by controversial and read all the comments that are like **"OMG THE DOG CAN EAT THE BABY"**
A life long friendship is made
How old is the doggy in this clip? I hope she’s young enough to have some good years left by the time this child is old enough to play with her.
What have we done to deserve such magnificent creatures..
She’s very maternal towards the little baby
Well the mom would’ve been exposed to the dog during pregnancy, so to an extent so would the baby. It’s not like the dog was rolling around in radioactive waste either. Whatever they’re exposed to, so are we as long as it’s our dog.
You mean her new tiny human! Super sweet.
*I shall protect you for the rest of my life, human*
Fairy dogmother
At a glance I thought the baby's head was a ballsack.
This is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen
Kinda a rough day...then this...thank you needed it
This is so adorable.
The look on her face is beautiful.
Gettin in on that new bay bay smell.
UH NO, she's concerned she's not gonna get  all of the attention!!!
Dogs are special animals
Great. Now I want a husky AND a baby.
Another reason why dogs are amazing
She got that gentle and loving eyes looking at the baby.
Oh man that’s so incredibly sweet! I love it 😍
my eyes are all misty andni dont knoe ehy brcause i thpught i deleted all my human emotions.
Oh my goodness my heart just melted 😭 These two will have a great childhood together
That is the cutest!!!!!
"Tiny human is mine too? Yeah, tiny human is mine too."
adorable
Dogs are too fucking pure for this earth. Im not a dog expert but I have to imagine that they know babies are the human equivalent of puppies and have the same reaction.
One of the sweetest things ever.
This is such a bittersweet memory for me. A few months ago we had to say goodbye to our sweet girl. When she met both of our kids she couldn’t contain her excitement. She adored them both and always was there with them. From the beginning. When I was pregnant she would hover over me and guard my belly. She would also walk me and turn around to circle around and then push me along gently as if to say “come on fatty, puppies aren’t an excuse to be slow on a WALK!”
“I will take care of this tiny human for the rest of my life.”
I'm a 28 year old guy and I get really emotional when I'm hungover. I need to stay hydrated not cry it all out thanks jackass
It has that *"new baby"* smell.
Thought the head was a ballsack for a solid 3 seconds
This is the definition of "awwww"
Even dogs love that new-baby smell.
"omg he smells like both of you, this is awesome!"
Or hungry.
We do not deserve dogs, but goddamn am I happy we have them
“Damnit it still won’t pet me”
Oh this is so amazing!
Aww
Malamutes are the best!
She's a good girl..no doubt about it!
"We're gonna be the best of friends"
More like... "This... thing... smells... WEIRD."
We have 10 month old dog and a 2 1/2 year old son.  I think it’s amazing the bond they have developed. It’s like she treats him like a puppy trying to herd him when he’s running around and keeps a watch when he’s in the sandbox along with other things I’ve seen in nature shows.
Smells like flowers
that dog looks hungry
This gif is everything
i love this a million times.
super cute, love dogs so much
I am literally dyeing right now...
That kid is going to have the best guard doggo
This is so beautiful. It made me tear up.
Most beautiful thin I’ve seen. This filled my heart with warmth.
aww
My mom told me that female dog she had when I was born did the same thing, and that she would lay next to my crib constantly like she wanted to protect me. I remember her a little. My two dogs are impressively patient with my niece. My female would sneak behind her little chair when she couldn't yet walk just to touch her with the nose on the back of baby's head. Now when niece is two dog follows her everywhere. Yesterday niece got into cabinet where I keep treats for dogs. I walked in and catched her. She knew she wasn't supposed to open cabinets, so she stood there with a bag of treats and said "gonna give it to Bonia! (My dogs name according to my niece). So she did. I couldn't bring myself to be mad because I was laughing inside. Dog was in heaven tho.Not every dog is great with kids and even when it is we should supervise them because they're animals and kids are kids, but they can go awesome together.
Man, considering how nice babies smell to us, to dogs they must have the nicest smell in the world.
My heart melted
protect mode, enabled.
We don’t deserve dogs...
That hooman is gonna get many wet noses.
He just met his best friend :)
Cute!
Dogs are so gentle
'I like dis pink puppy'
Sweet puppy
Clearly enjoying that new bb smell.
Dog: "Excuse me, but this is my baby now."
This may be the cutest thing I have seen all day.
I love the face dogs get around babies
What a good girl
Are dogs aware that human babies are delicate? She seems to be really gentle with the baby
Thank you for making my day a little bit better <3
I wonder how much they understand this is a new "pup" in the pack.
How PRECIOUS is this!!!!
For how long domesticated dogs have lived alongside humans, I'm sure they're probably instinctively aware of what baby humans are like, just as we are aware of them having puppies.
I just keep watching this.
boy, this is heartbreaking. too bad that puppy must wait so long to play with his new born best friend. :)
cute
She knows...This is splendid
And thus a lifelong friendship is born.
The animal instinct for newborns kicks in.
*aww* so cute . . . 😘
She's like: Holy crap it's so small!!!!
For those reason sometime I prefer dogs to humans they are just so sweeeeetCongrat for the baby also! :)
He just loves that new human smell.
Oh how I love this
That baby is going to love dogs when it grows up
This is so precious
My husky is way too hyper to do that
My six month old mal puppy and my seven year old son are on a path to becoming best friends- I’m not sure they realize they’re not the same species :) Mals are very intelligent, and seven year old boys not so much so I’m pretty sure they’re evenly matched. It’s what I’ve wanted for him since the day he was born- and we couldn’t be happier
She wants to eat your baby
Ah yes, that new baby smell. Breath it in.
Can...can I eat it?
My brother was worried about how his crazy, spoiled, not so perfectly trained, formerly pampered princess Fox Terrier would react when my nephew was born.  She loved him from day one and even "guarded" his room.  No jealousy whatsoever even though she got a lot less attention (maybe some relief in retrospect).Use common sense and don't set up any situations that could end badly, but dogs have been with humans for a long time.
My Golden, who had previously not shown himself to have even one protective bone in his body, immediately took over as protector when I brought my newborn son home. That night, he positioned himself between me and the door to the nursery, facing the door, as if to say “If you want to get to him, you gotta come through me first.”
“Mmm, little potato smells like mom”
Dog is looking a wee bit stressed :/
Thought the baby's head was a testicle (I'm gross I'm sorry) and had a very misconstrued viewing of this adorable gif
Dogs and humans coevolved together. They recognize human emotions and facial expressions. Makes sense they cherish our offspring as well
What did humans do to deserve dogs?
Dogs are absolutely adorable. I'm glad to be an owner of a rescued doggo :)
Love it. My wife and I just got home from hospital today with our first child. Our three cats could care less. Looking into cats for dogs exchange programs
I expected the dog to lick the baby's face.
"The pack grows stronger" - Doggo
Man I fucking love dogs! I mean there is no limit to their love, it is truly boundless
Congrats on your child, we just had ours last night! No doggo though :/
Nothing short of precious! Nothing.
Such a cute pair... that baby’s entire head could fit in the dogs mouth lol
Doggie knows that babies are eventually food slot machines. Licked faces, licked floors, easy begging... yeah, that pup hit the lottery and knows it.
I think that doggy sees a yummy morsel ready to eat.
It’s called jealousy......morons
Dogs are compassionate and understanding. You are the leader of his/her pack, therefor he/she knows that the baby is a part too. A dog can only be as good as it's master.
"I-It's... a hooman pup. Hallo hooman pup."
Aww so beautiful, dogs are more protective when it comes on to babies they really understand what's going on smart.
Cute, probably fine, but has a small potential for unspeakable horrors. No thank you with my infants.
It amazes me how dogs instinctively know how to treat and behave around human babies.
Hooman, tiny hooman
Keep your big dogs away from babies idiots
"Are you gonna eat that?"
This is the most adorable thing ever.
What type of dog is that? It’s beautiful
this is the cutest shit ive ever seen
When the dog looks at the camera they look so pure
Thats a look of jealousy o.o
Somehow you know that dog is going to love that little human for the rest of his/her life. What a nice moment to witness! My brovaries are glowing bright!!
Dogs truly are man's best friend.
"I want to bury this in the backyard."
Always amazes me how well so many dogs do around babies and small kids of all kinds.My dog plays rough with larger humans or who he sees as strong enough to play. Yet, he is so gentle with kids and calm. He doesn't jump on, push, lick or run around them. He will stay close, but doesn't lean on them, moves slowly and watches them. He was maybe 5 months old when he started displaying that. Dogs are truly amazing creatures.
[deleted]
The dog looks like it is sad that you only had a litter of one.
Wy u so smol?
god i love dogs
She’s the best girl.
Mmmm... Yum. Give it to me since you're not gonna eat it.
My parents had a husky when I was born and my parents said that she was insanely protective of me. When I was learning to walk, she would run over and make sure I was ok when I fell down. One time when I was still a baby I was crying and my mom was frustrated because she couldn’t get me to calm down. She shouted at me from another room asking me what I wanted to stop crying. The dog went into my room to protect me and for the next few days wouldn’t let my mom be alone with me in the same room. The dog passed when I was like 3 or 4 and I have a memory or two of her always being near me. I think most dogs have a sixth sense for babies knowing they are essentially helpless and need protection.
The cutest thing about this is that the dog would probably protect the baby with his/her life. The dog is completely aware if the fact that it’s a baby, and as it’s a baby in his/her pack, the dog will protect it.
"Wen the wurl attac, I protec! Promis!"
She’s hungry is what she is.
“Thank you for giving me this gift, hooman”
Classic example of how dogs become family and you can see the look in the face of this dog that even though you had this baby we are going to raise this baby it’s my baby to...❤️
I love this dog more than I’ve ever and will ever love another human being
So sweet!
I haven't commented in a post for years (I don't think), but I have to let you know this clip is AMAZING.  It brings a big smile to my face :)
Are dogs actually this smart? Do they recognize that this is an infant and you have to be delicate with them?
She is protecting her future partner in crime.
That is just the sweetest thing. Thanks for sharing. Brightened my day!
No she's just hungry that's all
Humans did something very right when choosing dogs as our companion species.
And my dog just peed on my new L-couch 🙂
I remember the day we bought each of our kids home and the immediacy with which the dog connected to them. Each time he was asleep next to their cot or basket right away, and he never left their side for his entire life. I miss my boy.
Puppers make the best babysitters. No cash required.
Babies smell WONDERFUL.
So cute. Also having a dog in the household is the best thing you can do for a newborn’s immune system!
We don’t deserve dogs
Dog looks at camera: " OMG it's so cute! I show him Trik. Hay budy, I'll lay my hed her, you lean in n boop the snoot"
Dog want to know how long until the tiny human can give ear scratches
she **protec**
milperthusky on Instagram! Both of their huskies are more needy than this human baby will ever be and I love it.
This makes me happy!! I’ve known too many people that have to give up their fur baby when the human joins the family
Dogs sense of smell is 40 times greater than ours... imagine how intense that new baby smell is for the lucky pup! It is the greatest smell in the world.
IT'S A TINY LITTLE HAIRLESS PUPPER!
ITT: dozens of people who own dogs but don't understand even basic psychology...your dog thinks it is part of a 'pack', your newborn smells exactly like both you and your spouse, it smells familiar, it smells like the pack...not just the pack the alphas in the pack so you damn sure love and protect that
How healthy/hygenic is this for the baby?
My heart just exploded. This is the sweetest thing.
Thats going to be something Special, i can just see itAll that aside._Doggo must hecking P R O T E C C_
totes adorbs
The way the dog looks up at the human and almost seems to ask "is this ours? Is it really?! No way!"
A good dog is the purest creature

[removed]
Babies just smell really good!
Blessed... all three of you.
my heart hurts
This melted my heart
Jealous of the dogs restraint to not lick! My heeler loves my 4 month old, but she can't resist the urge to lick him any time she's close enough to him!
I think this is my new favorite post of all time!
A bit off topic but the your shirt is so cool!!!!!
Gimme that husky.... NOW!
God I fucking love dogs
guardian
Female dog?
Love at it's finest.
Its probably the new baby smell.
Holy Doge, that doge is fucking adorable I just wanna fucking give it a pet.
Credit where it's due, this is @milperthusky!
He will drop food on the floor so dog will be Happy.
Ummmmm....chicken.....
u/bisexual-taco
My mom told me to have my husband bring home a couple diapers from the hospital to let the dog sniff baby smells.  No problems with 3 kids. .
The dog's name is Millie. The source instagram page this video is from (**milperthusky**) is full of *super* cute videos of her and her brother Rupert.
What an interesting pink cub you have here
This is too sweet.Our dog still isn't sure of the tiny human, and it's been 3 years! They just politely coexist. The cat, on the other hand, hates our son. Like, to the point where he sighs when the kid walks into the room...and yet, he still lets this child do whatever he wants to him! They'll lay on the floor together, my son smooshes his belly fat, grabs his feet and tail, gives him squeezes, the works, and the cat still puts up with all of it! As soon as there's a chance, though, he escapes to our room to hide from the tiny monster.Now that I'm expecting again, the cat has started snuggling with my belly. Maybe in the hopes that he'll get a more gentle friend this time around...(fat chance, fatso).
This makes me wonder: how is it that dogs and cats can sometimes understand if not care greatly for an infant so much?
I TOO LIKE TINY HUMANS HA HA HA. error ()
I wish my dogs loved our baby. They are jealous and scared of her. They move away when she reaches out for them and try to push her over when she is in our laps.
We don't deserve dogs.
Didn't this happen in one of the twilight movies?
This needs to be a feature length movie
"This hooman smells so goooooood"
That's her baby now
"Can I eat it already?"
How can something be so scary and cute at the same time
Dogs are the best
Can anyone tell me which breed it is? A Malamute? Very lovely dog :>
Nah.  She just doesn't want you to forget who is the First Baby in the house.
Oh I love pets and babies!
Lovely
"I love you humans, but that is the ugliest puppy I have ever seen. I mean it doesn't even have fur! And where is the rest of the litter?"
Why did i mistake the babies head for an oddly designed fleshlight for a second
my tired eyes have only seen a dog staring at a scrotum at first
[removed]
That’s the cutest shit I’ve ever seen
I did the same thing with my two dogs, the female embrace her, the male was kinda jealous but now they are all good.
I have a feeling that this dog literally finds this baby "cute" in the EXACT way that humans find puppies "cute".
What kind of pupper is that
Just imagine how many people would flip the fuck out if this dog was a pitbull.
Big Al says dogs can’t look up
"Can i eat it ?"
"We're going to be best friends, little human."
Insert appropriate Seinfeld joke.
I can already imagine all the adventures these two are gonna have...
The doggo is downloading the baby.exe content.
Oh my god this is one of the cutest things I have ever seen.
@milperthusky
we have had cats do this...
Smells like future funs
I always feel like bull terriers get a bad rap with children because occasionally some nutter who has brought their dog up to be pretty scary leaves them with a child and what everyone else could tell you was going to happen happens. My staffy Maxie was brilliant with children and everything she did was so soft and gentle where as she was really rough when playing with adults, god I miss her :(
I just realized that every dog who knows a baby from the start of its life will never really see that human completely grown up.Kinda fucked.
I'll just leave [this article](https://news.sky.com/story/woman-mauled-to-death-by-own-dogs-in-grisly-attack-in-us-11175051) here.
Oh my gosh.
You can just tell that dog is fighting the urge to give the baby face licks.
Cats are the same. They love the big, hairless, useless kittens.
What kind of species is this? A husky??
I wish our dog was like this. She's afraid of our new son, and won't even come within two feet of him. :(
That's really cute. Wonder what the husky is thinking.
Is this the title of Dr Hook's next song?
Oooooo mommy’s Butt Turkey !
I think that’s [my dog. ](https://i.imgur.com/3OId9qi.jpg)
I read somewhere that the Eskimos used to let their Siberian Huskies watch over their little children when they went out to go hunt for food.  I own a Siberian Husky myself and when ever he is around babies he gets real passive, calm but you can tell hes protective.  Its real amazing how traits are on passed on in certain breeds.  Dogs are amazing animals.  pS:  anyone that thinks this dog would harm the baby doesn’t know jack about Siberian Huskies.  They are the most friendliest and gentle breed there is .
She looks like one of the last Jedi furrbies. No spoilers.
This just reminds me of how much I Love dogs and hate cats.
Kona
How do you know it's a girl?
i used to get on at the same bus stop and ride the same bus with her every morning in Seattle. her owner hated all of the publicity she gets but he understood. she would sometimes get on the bus without him paying attention then she would get off at the dog park and he would meet her there. very cool dog
I would ride that bus just so I could sit next to that dog.
That's what Eclipse wants you to think.  She's actually cashing Social Security checks for her owner, who is buried in the backyard.
Wow, it took me at least eighteen years to get my act together as much as this dog right here.
I've seen Eclipse on the D line in Seattle (the route she takes). She got on downtown and hopped off in Queen Anne. I was so excited - it was like seeing a celebrity! But no one else cared so I felt like a dork.Edit: hey, thanks for the gold, fellow bus-riding dog fan! I hope other Metro riders get a chance to see Eclipse on the bus.
Yes!  I ride the D line everyday to work down at Pike Place Market.  I get to see this dog every now and then when the timing is right.  Always cheers me up on those cloudy Seattle days.
AMA Request - owner of this dog.
Amazing! How? She can even take a bus home?
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass
Good for her. I always feel bad for pets that are stuck at home alone all day while their owners are at work.
Rosa Barks
And I know fucking 20 year olds who can't even do their own laundry.
"Just goin to grab a drink w the girls, they took my license back in '08" -Eclipse probably
She's a strong independent doggo who don't need no man
Very intelligent dog.
but but...who plays with her at the dog park?
These are the kind of posts that I see, smile, read a couple comments, go back to the caption and pic, smile again, close reddit out. End on a good note.
Let me start by saying this is awesome and I'm glad it happens.But..... How is this legal? I thought most cities have rules against unattended animals and whatnot.
For those who would like to see a little clip of Eclipse :)https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/01/13/black-lab-rides-bus-seattle-washington/21726965/
This is the greatest animal story I've ever read if it's true!
But who picks up her poop?
I live in Seattle and I never see her! I'm clearly riding the wrong buses!!
My dog can't figure out how to get out from under a blanket about half the time.  This makes me feel very, very bad about my pooch.
This dog takes the bus to the park. Meanwhile my dog chews on his butt until he yells with pain, than continues to do it again and again
So cute! I hope nobody tries to take her :(
Such a well-behaved doggo! I can imagine her walking around downtown like Belle in the opening scene of Beauty and the Beast. Except people are friendlier and there are more pats and hugs.
once upon a time there was light in my life, now there's only love in the park

Heh, my dog did the same and went to visit the Seattle dog park.  At least, so I hope. I haven't seen him for a few years.  I live in the Netherlands.
My dog shit on the carpet while going outside yesterday...
My dogs cant even remember to not shit in the house and this motherfucker knows that bus schedule.
Hachiko's reincarnation I guess.

Self walking dogs. What a time to be alive
I wouldn't care if my dog knew exactly what he/she was doing and would make it to the park every single day, I would never let my dog do this. One day someone would take him/her guaranteed. The world is a shit place.
There was a time in this country that Eclipse would have to sit in the back of the bus.
Eclipse is so IntelliJ
This is Eclipse. Every day she shucks off her responsibilities at home and goes to the FUCKING dog park all day.
Looks like a ruff commute.
Just a small town hound . . .Living in a boring town. He took the city bus going any . . .where . . .
I want to believe this is all true so bad, but this damn internet is a cruel, cruel place.
Props to miles on 99.9kisw for breaking the story.
What does she do at the dog park? Do other dogs make the trek and they meet there? Or does she just sit on a bench watching people? lolSurprised History Channel or E haven't done a program on her; "Shining Bright with Eclipse".
Video on CNN from a few years ago about Eclipse riding bus[Seattle Public Transit has Gone to Dogs](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/living/dog-rides-bus-to-dog-park/index.html)
This is Seattle's Lil Sebastian.
What happens if an aggressive dog attacks her and no one is around to help with her injuries? At our dog park one stupid man with his Pit Bull kept hurting dogs and he didn't care. I'd hate to see her have to deal with that alone. It seems like the Pit Bull owner enjoys watching his dog attack others, he says 'oh he's just playing, that's how he plays' meanwhile dogs are getting legs ripped and head punctures... it's just not safe. Just like a young child needs their parent or adult supervision, your dog is kind of like a child.
I can't help feeling, if her owner intentionally lets her just wander around on her own, then that's not very responsible. That would mean that no one's picking up her poo and she could easily be stolen or injured. Sometimes, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
Seems pretty irresponsible to let your dog go by themselves but whatever...
Thank you! I usually completely ignore aww's but this one struck me for some reason.
Would love to see the video of a go pro attached to the dog.
Multipass
 Does she let u sit with her? That dog probably takes no shit from anyone. Like trying to hit on a girl on the bus. That sideways glance then eye roll
I caught this post just as I was walking by the dog park she visits!http://i.imgur.com/WZbthBN.jpgThe neighborhood looks after her here :)
Well maybe she should get a fucking job and buy a car instead of riding the bus^^^/s
Would love to see a video of her entering and then arriving at the park and what she does there!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's not a cat.
There ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball
This is something r/Leftovers would cream over
I was reading the comments here on my phone while playing Life is Strange when I realized *it was the Eclipse scene*.Life *is* Strange.
Eclipse Luna or Neon?
When you're a dog and life is making you lonely  You can always go - downtown.  When you've got worries all the noise and the hurry  Seems to help I know downtown.
So when the dog revolution happens, im going to point at shit like this and say, "I SAW IT COMING!"
I N D E P E N D E N T G I R L E
She is a strong, independent black lab and she will not move to the back of the bus
I work at a store downtown that she visits a couple times a week. People are baffled to see a dog walking around without an owner, but she's very well behaved & a joy to have around.
This post made me realise how smart dogs are and how stupid mine is
Damn, I'm not even that independent
She just wants to crack open a cold one with the pups.
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean? She got her own toys. She got her own bones. Bus pass, never growls she's a good dog.Oh god I hate myself but I had to get it out of my head...
So who picks up her shit?
A - How could you ever train a dog to do this?B - How is this not a problem in some way? A dog not on a leash, with no human caretaker, getting on  and off public transportation and wandering around a heavily populated urban area and he doesn't get in any kind of trouble? While I find this amazing and adorable, I'm surprised he can get away with this without animal control or something cramping his style.
Wholesome aww
It might be an incredible coincidence but I'm almost certain that is one of the RapidRide buses in Seattle.
If that's true it may be the coolest thing I've literally ever heard about. She takes her own bus pass and goes to the dog park?  There's still hope for us yet if that's true.
Is anyone fascinated by whether she gets off the bus of her own volition or if the bus driver does it?
Who let the dog out? woof woof woof
Shut the fuck up... my dog barely knows how to play fetch
No way!
wow, and I know people who can't figure out how public transportation works.
Lazy owners or overachieving owners, I'm not sure which!
The dog on the bus goes, "Bwark, bwark, bwark."
This is honestly the most precious thing I've ever seen in my life!! Way to go, Eclipse!!
Dogs are going to be the first alien friend of ours
Rosa Barks
Here's a news report. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz4XEpK6INU
I'd offer up my seat for this one
I wish I was this independent
American suburban variation on the Moscow metro dogs.
Smarter than most people in the world rn.
You all complain about dogs. I had a damned bird that would sit on my chest and peck at my lips/teeth at dawn. Every day.  Yes, she had a cage. Yes, it was covered. Yes, it was in my room.  Yes I could have shut the cage door.Ever heard a parrot scream?  NOW you know why. The neighbors called 911, thinking murder was happening. After that....well, refer to the first paragraph.
I live in Seattle, and more than once my dog has escaped the yard and gotten on the bus that goes to the dog park. Not the bus that we always take to go to the store, but the one we only use to go to the park.Every time, someone gets her off the bus and calls me.I feel like she's heard of Eclipse somehow. Maybe I should get her an orca card...
This is awesome. As for the people who are panicked about her being loose, that's how it use to be without people freaking out about every little thing. When growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, my dog would roam the neighborhood and everyone knew her. People would let her come into their homes and let her sleep over for an hour or so. Then Mitzi would trott home and be a happy puppy cause she went on her adventure. Just like humans they want to explore. She passed away at 16. I would never change that for her.
This dog is more capable than some people I know.
Dogs smarter than me, i can barely get the bus, i get nervous about prices and what to say
What? How? That's so coom
Debbie Downer here. There are way too many terrible things that could happen to her accidentally or maliciously. I'm not on board with this.
She runs around the dog park unsupervised?
How does this become a thing? Because I'm a decent guy but I can't imagine a bus driver allowing my dog to ride the bus unattended for even one stop.
Look at this [dogspreader](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9eee627188d82fc63fad2c16536a846831bb47d2/c=181-0-1652-1106&r=x483&c=640x480/local/-/media/2015/01/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635567831115685412-AP-US-ODD-Bus-Riding-Dog.1.jpg). Unacceptable
No leash laws?. Just curious.
Rosa Barks.
This dog is more independent than 75% of millennials.
Username checks out.
Makes me feel even worse about always getting lost with public transport
I love these stories but always question the first time the dog is allowed to go on her own.  Assuming the driver was in on it to make sure but wow what trust from a dog owner.
Labs are smurt!!
Anyway we could see a video of it?
Is that true??
Shit, I know some people who couldn't do that
What a good girl!
I need to know more.
Lies
No fucking way
What a cutie! Anyone know what kind of dog breed she is? She looks almost exactly like my dog & I can't figure out what my doggo is mixed with. Thanks in advance! :)
How does she get back?
Seattle?
R/woof_irl
No way
I would get lost or probably lose my bus pass
Wait you can do that?
What does an astronomer do when he sees a shaggy dog? Eclipse it!
I feel like I'm not being told a very important part of this story.
This is adorable, but I can't imagine letting my pups go to the dog park alone. I've seen too many fights break out among dogs at those parks.
This is an adorable dog, but I still prefer Netbeans...
This stuff makes me believe in reincarnation. Well this and that one Reddit thread about creepy children.
Funny. I'm in Seattle for the week and I'm almost convinced I've seen the fella
The owner sits at home by the window patiently waiting for Eclipse to come back from work
Love this pic, but I'm wondering...Are there leash laws to contend with?
Is this even real? If so, impressively trained pup
She recognizes the dog park whenever she sees it? That's a well-trained girl!
Quickly! To the woofmobile!
The goodest of girls!
Is this in Seattle???
is this real?  this is awesome if so
I get the worst passengers. Why can't I have this kind of shit in my route?
No gods, no masters
Not sure if great owners, or crappy owners and a great community around Eclipse. Anyone have a story here?
That's fucking awesome .
Allowed to pet?
Lazy dog owners can't even take there dog for a walk to the dog park.
I always thought it would be cats to take over the world. I was wrong.
How does that dog even know the bus schedule?
a neighbour dog used to always get out of his yard when i was younger and would legit break into our backyard and open the gate to get my dog because they were friends, i remember being like 6 blocks over and seeing them just running by together and it caught me off guard. That neighbour dog scared the fuck out of me one time tho i was in the woods on my bike and heard rustling behind me and was 100% convinced it was a cougar till i saw his wagging tail.
Eclipse is taking the bus to fuck all the bitches
This is quite possibly the smartest dog ever! Hats off to her owner(s,) nice job!!
Dogs are not allowed in the dog park.
I mean how though?
How are some dogs so damn smart and some so damn stupid?
Omg this has got to be my dogs twin!
I can't fuggin believe this is real. This is like a game changer for my life.
Nope
God help her if she ever met a dog named NetBeans.
I WANT TO BELIEVE SO BADLY
If dat aint evolution... dunno what is
This is  such bullshit
Worst. Seeing. Eye. Dog. Ever.
The men's room's own Miles a Montgomery aka DJ bus rider broke the story.
This is arguably the smartest dog I've ever heard of. And at the same time I worry myself sick just thinking about what would happen if she missed her ride.
I use to see this guy walk around Portland with his cat just chillin on his shoulder.
Does she pick up her own shit?
Yeah it's real!  I can see getting on the bus but idk how Eclipse knows which stop is the dog park.  The park is right next to the bus stop.
PLEASE PROTECT ECLIPSE AT ALL COST !!!
Must be a ruff commute during rush hour.
this might be my favorite thing I've ever seen
I've been on a bus (D line downtown Seattle) when she got on and it made my day! She's a very sweet dog. She got off at a stop where there's a dog park haha.
This is adorable and all but what owner allows their dog to do this?
Serious question. What about the poo? Or is eclipse timed out properly to poo back at the owners? Edit: just read the article. Poo is handled by owner that is not far behind.
I don't know why, but this seems so sad to me.
There's this dog named IntelliJ and she just teleports herself to the dog park.
And I can't even get my dog to walk straight on the leash.
I saw a dog walking itself on Block Island once. I was having lunch at a restaurant with sidewalk seating, and this big Golden Lab comes by, holding his own leash neatly in his mouth. No humans walking with or near him, and nobody seemed to think this was odd except me.
I can just picture the loyalty this dog engenders in the bus drivers. I'm picturing a passenger saying "I'm not sharing a ride with a dog!" and driver just TURNING on them "Fine. Get the fuck off my bus. Go on, get fucked. You're upsetting Eclipse."
Brb moving to Seattle
I was already amazed by stray dogs in turkey waiting for green lights to cross streets.This is on a whole other level!
Doggo haz multipass
Someone should attach a gopro to her and record her day. I would so wanna watch that
Can you imagine the bus driver like "Ohhhh hey sorry Eclipse, your bus pass is out of credits!" And the dog's just like "Nahhh nahhhh nahhhhhh I ride! I'm going to the park!"
Greatest thing I have ever seen.  Like lasers...with rock and roll.
Who's a good girl!!!!!
I feel like at some point someone complained she took up a seat but didn't have a bus pass. Then got a bus pass and everything was ok.
Is it normal for a dog to catch a bus in Seattle?
The headline here is amazing. I want more details. How was the dog trained to do this? How did the dog learn that "car things kill you" (you don't get trial and error with that one). How does she leave and enter the house? This is amazing and I want the deets.Also, the dog park we go to has a double gate system to avoid dogs escaping when someone is trying to bring their dog out. How does Eclipse enter the dog park there?
Let me get this straight, the (very intelligent) dog has to go to the dog park by itself because the owner is too lazy? Seriously?
She is like the Moscow metro doggos.
I live in Aachen Germany and I have a husky that is nearly all white and looks very wolfy. Everyone in this city knows my dog. I meet people for the first time and I bring up my dog and everyone is like "ohhhh Einstein!" Or I go into a bakery and people already know me because they saw me carrying down the street and while it is cool that everyone treats me super nice and is super friendly because of him I actually get pretty uncomfortable sometimes when I walked through the street and everyone is looking in my (dog's) direction. I don't feel like I can be anonymous, most of the time I don't care but sometimes I would prefer they didn't. So I understand why the owner might not like all the publicity
Oh dogs definitely have a sense of time. When I was in the military and only came home on weekends, my mom told me about 10 mins before I came home every Friday he would jump on the couch and wait for me or sit at the door and wait, and this was the only time she said he did this
This dog is going places
Does this seem irresponsible to anyone else?
Who's a good girl?
I would have a heart attack if my dog did this
They're evolving..
Not sure if cool or lazy owner... hmm?
tomorrows training lesson: Apply for job as Wal-Mart greeter.  It would make me feel a little more comfortable walking in Wal-Mart then some of the people they have greeting you now.
I want to believe.
And my neighbors dog just barks and eats his own droppings.
I worry now that she will be harmed on her way to or from the park or at the park for 15 minutes of fame.  I hope she is protected.
She's a strong, independent black lab!
So many questions:Why does she go to the park alone?How does she know which bus to get on?  How does she know which bus to get home?
Who picks up her poop?
Talk about lazy owners.
[deleted]
This makes me worry.
Does she clean up after herself too?
Not to be the party pooper, but no matter how cool this might be, it also seems highly irresponsible and disrespectful towards other people. What if something happens to the dog? And what about the people who want nothing to do with an unleashed dog? How are they supposed to know the dog doesn't just snap and turn aggressive all of a sudden? There's a reason why a leash is required by law where I live and it's not just to be mean to dog owners.
So who picks up her shit at the park?
That seems really fucking irresponsible of the owner.
who picks up her poop?
This makes me uncomfortable for some reason. I really, really don't like this. Too many crazy ass people in the world to be letting your dog go out on its own.
What if something goes awry! I'd be afraid if something went wrong/she got lost/stolen... this is awesome but also scary
I'd be too worried that some sicko would harm my baby. Adorable though.
The real question is who picks its shit up!?
Yeah here's the original post from 2015:http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2saipz/eclipse_dog_takes_bus_to_park_everyday_all_by/?st=J3WGTFHO&sh=3b32aa5d
Cute but terrible owners.
Holy fucking shit??
No one thinks that dog is a alien in disguise Jesus people
I'd give up my seat for her.
If you need me, I'll be on the bus all day everyday to see this doggo and give pets, lots and lots of pets
What a good dog.
Just waiting for a Portlander to tell you about "this may be a little weird for Seattle, but it's totally normal in Portland"
Oh my gawd. I need to go visit Seattle more often!
I would love to see a video of his day at the dog park including the 2 bus rides. That would be so wholesome.
This is so sweet and amazing!
Does she pull the cord?
How cute this is has completely shattered my world-view.
Does anyone know the genesis of this?
I would be scared someone would come up on my amazingly smart bus riding dog!
Only if the driver feels like stopping at the right stop. No way is that dog pulling the stop string thing
This dog has its life more together than some of the weirdos that live there.
Feels very much like something out of a Pinkwater book.
Everyday I think, "Nothing could make me want a dog anymore than I already do", and things like this show up.
This looks like a Vancouver bus
That's adorable
This is the dog version of Matilda.
Does he return by himself?
Seems like it sometimes.  Seattle has the nicest days in the world I've ever had....the 3 days it's nice.
Smart Dog and OMG adorable too
Dogspreading!!
The goodest dog tbh
Eclipse, the black doggo of darkness that shall unite Midland. Had she ended any 100 year wars yet?
cute i have a yellow canary
I can see her just climbing up on someone if there isn't any seats left. So adorable.
Is anyone else a little angry? I get fined if my feet touch the seat but a rouge dog gets to ride shotgun.
Shit I couldn't teach my ex gf how to do this
Does she return home or does the stay there and her family picks her up?
This pup can get herself all the way to a park by bus, mine can't figure out he can enter the house when a sheer curtain is in the way.
My great grandfather used to have a dog that ran all over town to a female dog when she was on heat, then he was tired when he ran all the way there so he took the bus home. Everyone including the bus driver knew whose dog it was so it was chill.
But will she make space for me if its full and the only empty seat was next to her?
While you all talk about Seattleans like they are doing a bad thing with not caring, here in my country, this would've never even happened let alone people not reacting to it. The first day a poor doggo tries it, either some maniac with a gun would shoot it or some other maniac would do maniacal stuff to it that I don't want to imagine.
Yea, well my dog can sit AND shake.
Please give me that dog <3
Is she dogspreading?TRIGGERED
I bet that Eclipse's tail goes nuts if you make eye contact with her and say "hi."
A friend of mine had a Border Collie like this. She knew how to navigate the Bay Area (loooooong ago so I forget if this was Berkeley or SF or what) and if she got bored, she'd often do a lap around the neighborhood to check out all his favorite bars to try and find him. Sometimes we'd just be hanging out and suddenly his dog is at the bar too. There's something really impressive about a dog that adapts so well to society that they understand the public transit system, stop lights and the like.
How in the fuck?  I, for sure, couldn't even do this without my phone.
Does she pick up her own poop?
She looks like my Lily. Lily was put down because the meds couldn't control her seizures.
Wow what a smart dog 😀
There's an island in Greece called Skiathos and when I was there, each day a dog got on the bus in town and rode it down to the beach
Is this trained or just a very smart dog who learned that habits of getting to the dog very park.
/r/soposts
... My dog still runs into walls by accident
I want to hug this dog. I hope she lives forever.
What timeline is this?
Yeah, but when is Eclipse doing an AMA?
All I see is a strong and independent black lab that don't need no man. ;)
When a Dog has a more involved social life than me.
Russian dogs mastered public transportation a long time ago. http://abcnews.go.com/International/Technology/stray-dogs-master-complex-moscow-subway-system/story?id=10145833Eclipse is a Russian spy.

She also pays rent every month and goes to the gym 3 times a week
Where’s the owner??
Good doggo 🐶☺️
God bless this dog I hope nobody tries to hurt it!!
Does she pull the stop cable at the right moment? Or do the drivers just know to always drop her off at the same spot?
After watching a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLVKVPc_Z6k) [clips](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/01/13/black-lab-rides-bus-seattle-washington/21726965/) of Eclipse...she must feel like the man when shes taking that route
Is this legal?
This is so awesome! Pigeons in London use the underground trains (getting on and off at different stops) but never have tickets, because humans can't pick the offender out of an identity parade...
First time we took our labrador by bus, my wife told her to sit as she was buyinh a ticket. When she turned around, our lab was comfortably seated on the seat, next to a guy in a suit. Priceless.
And here I know many adult humans who can't seem to do the same
Nothing in the rulebook says a dog can't ride the bus.
That's incredible. I'd love it if my dog were this independent.
Coolest dog ever!
My gf made a good point, who picks up after her poop?
what a happy doggo and a smarty pants
*cough* those are not tears, just, I have some, you know...dust in my eyes <3
Oh neat! It's Seattle!
[deleted]
Citizens are not even supposed to be consciously aware of the dog park.  Do not enter the dog park.
all i can think of is how the fuck does one teach a dog to be this autonomous. I see dogs walking without a leash i lose my mind, this guy doesnt even need an owner anymore.
This reminds me of the stray dogs in russia using the subway system :P
Smart doggo
Ok it is cute, but isn't the owner worried she might get kidnapped?
Dogs are not allowed in the dog park.
My first reaction is to feel sad that she goes by herself. Does her owner ever go with her? Of course second reaction is OMFG A DOG IS RIDING THE BUUUUUS
I wouldn't let my dog go around by herself like that. It's irresponsible. I'd be afraid of some shitty person abusing her.
How large of a town do you live in? I live in Miami and all I can think about is that someone would have stolen that dog the first day it tried public transport.
How deplorable. Dogs are becoming too independent these days Smithy, next thing we know they'll want to vote!
/u/bexnoodles19
Dogs are the most intelligent creatures on the earth next to your mom
This dog is going places...
You really know your place in the world when you get lost using google maps on your daily commute whilst this handsome fella cruises the public transport network without fuss
Before leash laws, many dogs had lives like this.Let them out in the morning, they go out, do their business, visit places, see friends, come back in the evening.I'm glad to see at least one dog gets to still live that life.  Not sure how it's legal...no leash laws in Seattle?
r/rarepuppers
She Has  A Life More Organised Than Me...
She's a good girl!
I'm new.  How the fuck does a dog get on and off a bus by itself at a regular schedule?  Are you telling me this is a thing?
Meh, my dog has her own car and she drives herself downtown, she can even stop by the market and get me some food on her way back. Her name is IntelliJ.
I'm easily impressed but I would completely lose my mind if I saw a dog go through the process of taking public transportation, by itself, to go to the dog park....it would be like the first time one of my kids made their own breakfast without destroying anything.
Maybe this will be the start of a doggie movement. #frontofthebus
I rly don't want this to be fake news
This dog is manspreading
Absolutely the most adorable thing I've ever seen. And so nice of the bus company to give her a bus pass.
Dumb question here but where is the dog's owner?
No i'd totally be excited to see this!
My home town (Merrill, Wisconsin) had a dog just like this way back when they had a trolley, who would get on the trolley in the morning and go the west side, and get back on to go back east at night. The high school just painted a huge mural of him on the side of a building. They called him Jack the Trolley Dog.
Bullshit
Even I don't have a bus pass:(
Say what?  This is a thing?  Why do I feel so sad for the dog!?  If my dogs did this I'd be worried sick and feel like a terrible ownerI hope this is fake.  How does the dog know what bus to take and what not too??
Seattle looks cool that dog is cool to
I want to know how the dog is trained to go solo, I would be so stressed if I put my dog on a bus alone. I have to drag him out of the park, he's not voluntarily leaving that place alone.
does dog never scare anyone? I'm a dog owner and love dogs but seeing him unattended make me anxious because of how many people with dog hangups there are.
She is so smart🤗🐶
News story: https://youtu.be/Bz4XEpK6INU
What a beauty! :D
Am I the only person worried about who's picking up the dog shit if she's travelling by herself?!
My heart can't handle how wholesome this is ;-;
Bet this is in Seattle
Lol she thinks she's people.
How does he know which bus to take?
I wonder is she rode back on her own too
Wish this dog could talk. Would love to know how it knows.
Mom, i can take the bus by myself, u are embarrassing me front of Eclipse.
This is the kind of thing I should receive notification for, not stupid jokes.
Dog parks are amazing places to head to when you just need a bit of therapy for your soul and and don't own a dog of your own.
Here's a news segment that was made about her a few years ago: https://youtu.be/Uh4eR8kZwHI
I got to meet another dog like this. He was a self taught scouting dog that worked for the Marine Corps. I met him at the last year of his life, god rest his soul. He use to go on foot patrols with the unit and fend off dogs and local afghans that got to close. Extremely hardworking and honestly If I could I would have a monument made for him at the Battalion I deployed with. To be fair we all didnt want him to be put down but the whole rabies issue was a health concern higher ups couldnt take a chance with. His name was Willy Pete, I have a couple pictures of him on an old hard drive, but here is a photo of some of the guys I worked in the same Battalion with and the legend himself. https://www.strategypage.com/gallery/images/willy-pete-afghanistan-dog-07-2011.jpg
How sad :( take your dog to the park or don't own a dog... anything could happen to it with nobody taking care of it.
She then walked herself home, ate a pizza and took a nap.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBIX_Y-fT24
Does she also bag up and bin her own poops while she's there?

I'll never understand how Reddit works. This picture and accompanying story is as old as the internet. I think I first saw it when I was on CompuServe. Yet here it is on "the front page of the internet" with 200k ups. ? Maybe I can blow up Reddit with a pic of grumpy cat.
Labs are honestly just the best.
I wish I knew how to train my dog like this.
Would love to sit next to her on the bus
Meanwhile most parents won't even let their kids go to the park by themselves... lol.
No matter how clever my dog was I just could not trust it walking alone in the streets, idiot drivers, thieves or people trying to feed and pet the dog. Too risky for me but none the less it's amazing that this dog is able to do so.
I wonder if the bus drivers of that route think "boy, I hope she gets on my bus today"
It seems like these really cool stories and occurrences happen everywhere except my city. So everything is like, real, fake or "omg, how?"
I hope that dog gets special pet discount for a riding a bus with a monthly pass.
awwww, this is awesome. be safe, Eclipse!!! what a good dogger.
A real life Carl!
Htf is that even possible? My puppy gives me a shit eating grin if I tell her to sit or to stop chewing my shoes 😂
Look at her face lol she's living the life
don't really know why, but this just made my day. Want to pet.
The dog is smarter than me
Doesn't every city, especially ones big enough for public transportation have leash laws?
I'm calling bullshit
I wish she had a GoPro on for a day to truly see her adventure
But but but who picks up her poop?
Hey yesterday was an eclipse
goddamn it thats dangerous as fuck, some crazy homeless shitbag is gonna hurt that poor dog.
How sweet!! 😄
Oh my DOG!
This really makes me smile. I wish we had more understanding people and doggos like this.
Every now and then I feel like some Reddit posts should be deserving of two upvotes per person. This is one of those occasions.
I hope she never gets hurt whilst doing this, what a smart and good dog
The alternative headline being about a dog owner that's so lazy the dog has taken to catching the bus alone in order to get some fresh air.
You could almost say Eclipse is *IntelliJ*ent.No one? Okay.
Lol sort of sad the dog has to take itself to the dog park. Sure it doesn't need its human, but some company is nice.
Yes this is remarkable and cute, but I do think it's bad parenting. Yes I can teach my 4 year old to do the same and they'll probably be OK most of the time, but it's not a good idea.
Fake
Stop starting sentences with "So"... you sound like an idiot.
Why would you start your comment with "So"? This is Eclipse etc... is correct.
And then there's my dog who's so fucking stupid he can't even learn the sit command
OMG I WISH MY TOWN HAD A DOG PLIKE THAT
What if God was one of usJust a slob like one of usJust a doggo on the busTrying to make her way home?
What a shitty owner to not be able to take the dog to the park.
my naem is 'clipsi liek to ridei liek the park my tiem i bideand evry day i ride the busthe many peeple make a fussbecause a sooprize what they seea doggo ride the bus, that me!
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass
Eclipse and the Mystery Soda are some of the only quarks Seattle has left.
What a smart dog!
The next time I hear about this dog, it'll probably be a post from someone saying that he died. I'm already getting pre-sad to prepare myself.
We need to protect her what if she gets stolen :(
I don't buy it
"Look, a dog that goes to the dog park by itself! Cool!""Look, a ten year old that goes to the park by herself! Call social services!"
wow its a dog big fuckin deal
Is this not illegal?
I smell a bamboozle...
Somehow I think this would be normal in Japan
Why did this title start with "so"?
Give it a month and you'll see her on your local news channel.
Last time I was with my Corgi in a bus in Seattle, the bus driver told me not to bring my dog to her bus because dogs are not allowed in Metro except for Service animals. I had to quit my job and look for another that is dog friendly and close to home which wasn't really easy.
I don't know why, but this made me so incredibly sad. It's like... a dog with no human? I don't  really know why that response, but it's super sad.
I downloaded this thread.
So wait.. someone actually spends the money to get their dog, their own bus pass?!
Ha, this is great. Where I live, if you take your dog on a bus with you, buy a bus pass, carry it in a doggy bag, simply, obide by all the regulations, there is always someone who will give you shit. I love posts like this. It gives me the feeling, hey, there really are nice places/communities/people/etc in the world.Good for you doggo!
She must be incredibly smart to know bus routes and timing
I know this dog! She quite frequently visits us at RE-PC. She is a very mellow and sweet dog. She comes in looks for scratches from the staff, then finds a spot near the staff room to lay down and wait for her owner to finish shopping.
How do you even teach a dog to do this?
How do you dm someone
We don't deserve dogs
That's one lazy owner haha
This is adorbs, but I get looks and comments when I let my pups run around without a leash NEXT TO ME... I can't imagine there hasn't been an asshole to report this to the police or animal control
P U B L I C     T R A N S P O R T A T I O N     P U P P E R
One day she won't find her way back. Could never let my dog do this
I'm in Seattle for the summer! I need to find her!!
That is fucking adorable, holy shit I want to hug and pet that dog.
I wish the owner would put a GoPro on this dog.
I would be so nervous letting my dog somewhere by his self. I cant imagine starting a routine like this.
That's amazing. I can't even take the bus
They are evolving...
Just wondering why she had to go by herself? Are her owners disabled?
How does she get home?
She's such a good dog
My poor derpie dog would never be able to do this.  Oh well love her anyway.And whoever said Seattleites are weird, I lived there until 20 and when I go back what strikes me is how grim and unhappy everyone is.  It's marked.
KISW's The Men's Room covered this story a couple years ago! Guess the dogs owner occasionally goes with, and on the dogs collar there's even a buss pass!
OMG THAT'S THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD OF A DOG DOING
Reminds me of when I had no friends as a kid, and would sometimes go to the mini golf place by myself to hang out by myself. Thanks for that, brain.
Kind of bums me out that her human can't go with
Reminds me of those wild dogs in Russia who take the subway to the city to beg for food.  They even sometimes miss their stops cause they pass out on the way XD
I would like to witness that myself. I think it's cool that it has become something natural.
So, how the hell did she learn this?
I hope this isn't fake
That dog is smarter than some of my friends... They can't ride a bus for their lives... End up somewhere in the middle of a field or something
The goodest girl
Is her human companion unable to go on walks with her? Just curious as to why she is alone, anyone know?
On the bus, no one knows you're a dog!
A function and productive citizen of this land.
every single day?
Considering I live in Tacoma near Seattle Ima have to check this out any days eclipse always gets on the bus?
So cute ☺️
Seattle is a weird place loved it though stayed in bell town. I hope to go back soon but you never know too many places to see.
The bus drive  is in on it
So how do they get her to go home? I have to drag my dogs away from the dog park or they'd just stay there forever. Lol.
Why doesn't she have anyone to go with? :(
Where is this?
Adorable story, but the dog probably takes a fat dump and nobody's around to clean it up. That's the first thing I thought of as a dog owner... :(
It's so funny she has to pay fare.
I love dogs so much. I have 2 black labs and I'm trying to find a corgi pup now!
Be safe, doggy
CUTENESS OVERLOAD
One of my neighbors trained her dog to walk itself and he goes on walks every night at 8. It's so cute
It can be noticeable but Seattle will be milder than Denver.  You trade the rain for a gorgeous area.  When it's sunny it's so nice here and there is so many things to do outdoors.
This is so adorable
And she takes multiple stops! And knows where to get off. It's awesome.
Wow i can't even get my dog to fetch anything
I dont even know her, but I love her.
I can't even take my dog on a bus here and yet this dog can get on a bus by itself?
I want my dog to do this
That Dog has more freedom then I had when I was 13
In DC it's illegal to have a pet unattended and not on a leash.  People who are scared of dogs probably were terrified
How does one even go about buying a bus pass for a dog? How much do you charge a dog?
Smart dog
[ABC News article on this awesome doggo!](http://abc13.com/pets/watch-dog-can-ride-bus-without-owner-to-dog-park/472964/)
This renders the bus unusable for people afraid of animals/dogs I'm a dog person but my mom is one of many who were traumatized by an early experience with a dog. In this case a dog mauled her sister. And to this day I have to stand between her and any dog we encounter that's not on a leash. And leave the area with her.Dogs gotta be leashed on public transit if literally nowhere else. "It's a nice dog" ain't the point
Someone should GoPro her adventures!
u/shittymorph
How do you train a dog to do this?
Until you realize the owner took the pic, and it's all an elaborate lie.  This isn't saachan. Don't be fooled.
I'm too lazy to scroll through the messages but is the owner up for laziest dog owner of the year or what?
dog owners must be lazy fucks. maybe someone should bring the dog home and take it to the park regularly so it wouldn't need to walk itself.
Next thing you know they're gonna be taking our jobs.
Doesnt this dog belong to anyone?
No fucking way this is true
This is too good to be true!
Next trip to Seattle im meeting Eclipse.
I'm done!
Thanks, my mistake. Good pupperina.
How!?? Just how? Wut!?!
Why doesn't her human take her to the dog park? I would be so nervous that someone would hurt her or steal her.
Is your name Miles Montgomery?
SWEET BABY
What time does Eclipse ride the bus?
Player with no car = no bitches.
What's the back story? I'm curious why the dog goes by itself every day - where are it's humans? I wish they'd let my dog ride the bus.
Well behaved than 80 percent of the rest of the bus
What a sweet puppy
When animals are taking the bus to work, you know we are living in the Last Days :-p
Does she have a job to get to?
I would like to see humans become chill enough that we can live in harmony with the animals who "get it"
This is fantastic!
We need a video.
How does she know when to get off? If she can do it by herself, that's pretty smart.
omg
I wish I had a dog like that that's amazing that the dog is able to do that itself.
I hope she picks up her own poop.
This is incredible.  At the same time it's kinda like, the fucks up with the parents?  I'd just be to nervous.
I wonder why there are no bus riding dogs in detroit, baltimore or johannesburg
People don't try to steal the dog and/or the bus pass??? I wouldn't but where I'm from someone would.
Yup dirty to the core like the rest of you baby boomers... lol replied to the wrong thread I have drunken millennial fingers we like to just point the blame any direction
love
Come on.
Haha all the stuff I commented on tonight it would be the cord puller that bothered to respond ..."I ain't no dirty cord puller!"... I won't ever touch public transit if I got pull some cords just to get off...
This is actually incredible
She doesn't look handicapped or senior to me.
Is this real? If so that is too cool
Eclipse the dog has a better life then me.   So much freedom so much happiness
Amazing!
How did this passenger to verify the ticket...??? )
Whaaa?!?!?
You know it's two midgets dressed up don't you?
Umm...sorry to ask but how does she get home? Only answer I guess....by bus? And she does this all without a watch or cell phone. Amazing.
I'm trying to imagine my dog trying to do this, and the chaos that would ensue.
Doggos be clever
So what does this dog do when it arrives at location?
Heh - the bus name in my town is called the 'Eclipse'
My dog just stares at the wall all day.
Is this legit? Holy fuck!
This is fantastic- unless your allergic haha
Sounds more like IntelliJ to me. /r/programmerHumor
You going to the park to frend
How does she know where to get off?
[Ah, the old spy-in-the-dog-suit trick!](http://ilovegetsmart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ep13e.jpg)She's probably leaving dead-drops for the Russkies!
How adorable!
I'd be such a nervous wreck if my dog was off on her own.
Fucker taking up two seats! Bad boy!
Sitting big. Adorable, of course she looks like my Ows. :)
Another reason to live in the city if you have a dog that needs exercise: the bus lines & dog parks.
She's so smart
does she press the stop button?
this is the best thing i've ever seen in my entire life
Someone call child services!
I dont know the backstory here, but how did this start ? Did the owners push the dog on the bus and said to the bus driver to let her off at some point and everyone just got along ?
How does the dog know to take the right number bus back? What if there's delays or the bus gets cancelled for some reason?
This is my face when I get on a bus and it's empty.
While my dog, retardo the blunder dog can't work out that if he walks under people's feet he'll get stood on.
People here are just weird. Really weird...
This is fkn insane
This is so impressive. I wonder the swries of progression until owners were like "oh our dog is a genius, she can take herself to the park now "
Omigod I have the cheaper version!
Doggo more civilized than Human smh 😍❤👌👍 good boy :3
Aww how cute!
Beautiful doggo
So, her name is ECLIPSE? Is she named after the worst Java IDE?
This is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen
Is that the only bus on that route ,if not how dog recognises that particular bus that it has to board 🐕🐕🐕🐕
My kind of dog
I want this dog. :(
What lazy dog owner doesn't take their dog to the park?
I N D E P E N D E N T G I R L E
What? No? Is this the best Doggo ever?
Wow, what an awesome and smart dog. Is the owner not concerned someone will try and take the dog? : /
I thought from the thumbnail it was an Fat old woman crouched over hence the nick walking past his apartment window.
Is Eclipse a labradore / border collie mix? Aka Bordador?
So who picks up her poop?
I wonder if things were still pre civil rights if they'd make this dog sit in the back of the bus. I'd bet not
Thats cute! They dont allow dogs on the buses here, with or without their human. Lol
What a sweetheart.
[deleted]
do dogs pay bus fare?
She looks exactly like my fluff, even down to the same color collar!
She's smarter than people.
What if she takes the wrong Bus?
Total Eclipse of the heart
Ha ha that's funny
I'm not sure what's more surprising, that a dog takes the bus to the park, or that somewhere, pets are allowed on buses.
She has her own FB page and loads of pics getting pets along her route, all with a big smile on her face. She clearly lives for this.
Why do so many top posts on r/aww claim the animal does whatever thing "everyday/all the time/only" when it's blatantly obvious the animal doesn't do it often ?So strange to me.
I'm so curious to know how she learned to do this. Most of the time I feel like I have to go somewhere with no one around to even let my dog off the leash, let alone her wandering by herself
The City Council announces the opening of a new Dog Park at the corner of Earl and Somerset, near the Ralph’s. They would like to remind everyone that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. People are not allowed in the Dog Park. It is possible you will see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park. Do not approach them. Do not approach the Dog Park. The fence is electrified and highly dangerous. Try not to look at the Dog Park, and especially do not look for any period of time at the Hooded Figures. The Dog Park will not harm you.
This is it, this is the future. A world where animals and humans get along in harmony and animals are even able to use public transportation by themselves, and go to the store to buy doggie treats... or starbucks
If I ever got to Seattle, I will ride this bus until I see this dog.
Why does this post start with the word "So"?
This is absolutely amazing! I'm in love
Literally more independent than me.
I thought dogs like to walk.
How does the dog get back into her home?
Meanwhile I get lost taking a simple bus stop
Does she clean up her own poop at the dog park too?
Cool stuff, I only just thought about it but just like people animals can differ in that some are born or develop parts of the brain that have a higher capacity of learning.
without a doubt the coolest dog on earth!
Meanwhile I still cant navigate the MBTA red and orange lines after 27 years..
Sorry to ruin everyone's fun but what type of dog is that
They could have used drones to carry ropes up to people they could have tied off in their apartments and scaled down!
"I don't like OP" and "I don't like pit bulls" are not reasons to report a post. Please stop.
It's the opposite with my dog. She has epilepsy and suffers fits sometimes. It can be very scary seeing someone you love have an episode so we just try and protect her, make sure she doesn't hurt herself until she's lucid again. Then afterwards she gets lots of hugs.
My cat sits by me and alerts my partner when I have a seizure. I know it's not as cool but I am proud of him.
Extra good boy
Dog: "This is fine.  Everything is fine.  Seriously, I've got you."  :)
Hmm, can the dog understand just how critical the situation is or does he think he is just being trained in advanced cuddling? Regardless, I'm sure he knows he's getting some treats out of this.
Saw this was posted yesterday on /r/videos (based on post title) but didn't click because I didn't feel like watching a video at the time.I literally said to myself, "I'll just wait til /u/GallowBoob turns it into a gif."And here we are...
This is also my dog when I try to do pushups. She's also a good girl.
What did we do to deserve dogs?
Not all heroes wear capes.
> This is how Colt is trained to block my head during a seizure, because I have a TBI it is very dangerous for me to hit my head, I can literally die if I hit my head really bad again. This is only a reenactment, this is NOT a real seizure. And no of course I'm not really hitting my head in this video. This is just us keeping up with his training, I have to test him on everything that he knows often to make sure he still does it all reliably. He is trained to do this in a certain way that keeps both him and me safe, he will not get hurting doing this the way he has been trained to. I'm not actually there during a seizure so I would not be able to know if he did his job right or not. The middle video is basically a blooper, I laughed so hard, the floor was super slippery and he had a hard time getting his body under my 10lb head. The important thing that makes me super proud is that he never stops trying. He always looks back to make sure I am safe and keeps trying till I am. I am so blessed to have him. He has saved my life in many ways. [Source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZskqSLnMDRQ&feature=youtu.be)
GREAT BOY STATUS UNLOCKED.
"You call it training, I call it snuggles" -Dog probably
"I'm helping because I love you"
That is one really good dog. He's all like "OK Momma we play the game where I force you to use me as a pillow, yeah I know momma im a lumpy pillow but beatin your head on me won't fix it"
I was always taught to not touch the person when they're having a seizure and to just clear everything from around them. Would the dog pushing his body under her head like that not be a risk?    If not, this is adorable as it is amazing. I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate here. Just wanna know some stuff about things, ya know?
This is so badass. Just to be clear though, that woman is faking a seizure right now for the sake of the training right? I've never actually seen anyone have a seizure so I couldn't say what it looks like
My mom has epilepsy and is moderately functioning. How can we get her a good boy like this one?
Throwaway to say that dogs are amazing and their pureness makes me cry. When I was a teenager, I had a self harm problem. I'm currently 3 years free. What made me stop? We got my dog 3 years ago. She caught me self harming ONCE and started barking up a storm and jumped up on me, trying to knock the scissors out of my hands. Still makes me cry to this day. Love you, Marlee <3
Perfect, sweet boy.
That's a good boy.
And now I'm crying.
The girl in the video says the dog is a weimaraner and labrador mix. It does not say anywhere that it is a pitbull?
I tried this with my cat. He sat on my head.
I have one of these animals. Sure, they have the potential to be aggressive and violent - but that's just like any other animal or person that you teach and mentor. These animals have all the same ability to love and be sweet. It's all about who the owner is, what environments they are exposed to, and how you treat them.I adopted a pitbull that was 5 days away from being put down just because she was a pitbull who was found on the street with no known history. She's the best fucking thing to happen to my life. I was in severe depression with no feeling of purpose and she put light back into my life. Edit - this comment won't be at the top and that's fine, but for those who do see this don't buy into the stereotypes. This video provides visual proof of how loving and emotionally aware these animals are.I wish I could take them all home.
For those that don't know, the owner already suffers from a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), so if she ever hits her head hard enough, she could die. The dog is literally saving her life when she does have seizures.
OP said it was a weimaraner/lab mix. Not a pit.
Dogs are amazing!
Not a pit bull folks.
Nothing brings a dog more happiness than a purpose or a way to contribute. It reminds me of the 9/11 search and rescue dogs. They were so determined to find living people, that they got depressed. Search and rescuers had to bury themselves in rubble so the dogs could find a living person.
"It's okay mom I lie here now."
Fuck those pitbull bans. Ban bad owners
The goodest boy!!
Dogs sense of smell is so acute they can smell cancer. Penn Vet Working Dog Clinic is working with dogs to do this.
I had a Pitt Bull named Tyson that ended up becoming my brother's dog. My brother has some issues, and Tyson seemed to always calm him down. It's almost as if Tyson knew what to do. He's been registered as a service dog now, and is still happily taking care of my brother.
Let's be real, OP doesn't repost, he "crossposts" but if reposting wasn't so looked down upon he would do it in a heartbeat. Makes money from it either way, though.
That neck game.
If you saw the youtube video, the owner clearly says the dog was hand picked from the litter by herself and a behavioralist.https://youtu.be/ZskqSLnMDRQI'm much more inclined to believe the owner over a redditor.
I didn't think I could love dogs more, but I was wrong.
This is what a dog does. A cat, on the other hand, would back up to her so her face was bouncing on its ass, because cats are fucking jerks.
I see in his eyes that he understands this is serious. Dogs are too good for us.
This is not a pit bull, this is Colt the Service Dog, he is a Weimaraner/Lab, look up their YouTube channel!
I have a cat that will calm me down. I get super stressed and have panic attacks. A dr said I probably have PTSD because of my past. But my cat wasn't even trained to do this. She was on discount at a local pet store that sold animals for the humane society. I didnt even want a cat at the time but felt a connection with her and her roommate. I also didn't want them to die bc that is where they were headed.Every time I'm upset or angry she comes and cuddles me. The more pissed off i get the harder she cuddles me. She sleeps on me every night. Sets me know when to calm down and it makes me a better person.Animals rock.
I teared up watching, as a wee lad my dog was my best m8 and no matter how horrible shit got in my house or outside,he was always there to comfort me. I wish i could tell him how much i loved him and still do.
God he's the best boy, doing a great job 👍🏼
I don't know why, but I always thought dogs would attack people having seizures. No logic to it, but I just thought they would.
WE ARE NOT WORTHY
Please cross post this in r/epilepsy!  I think some of us would find it interesting
We don't deserve dogs.

"That looks like it hurts... Here use my head instead"
I should show this to the people who I work with who get mad whenever a non-blind person walks in with a service dog...
"The lengths I go to for a little petting..."Joking aside, dogs are awesome, especially service dogs.
He should've put a wallet in her mouth.
*Oh my gosh this is so cool! OP must be someone who works with service dogs I'd love to ask them about it!* **sees username***nevermind.*
This is not the dogs owner. She is not having a seizure. This is a woman training a service dog. OP took someone's video that was on my front page earlier today and made it into a GIF.
I don't like pit bulls not reasons to report a post
Good boy, just don't get your ear caught in her mouth or you'll have a bad time.
I had to do that when my dachshund had seizures. Guess that makes me a service human. But seriously I'd do it all over again. I miss that dog!
His eyes were saying "I hope mama is okay.." We don't deserve dogs. What a good boy!
For those talking sh** and not taking it serious, 1 glorious day you would wish you had a magnificent animal like this watching out for you.  People suck, so dont expect bystanders to help. #natureisfukinglit andhumansarenotworthy
Nicest dog I ever knew was a Staffy bull  bitch called Maxie, I didnt own her she was a part of the family, she died a few years ago age 15, she would have gone to the grave to help a human, most loving animal I've ever known, was brilliant with children never so much as showed her teeth never mind bit one, I honestly put her on a higher level than half the humans on this planet x RIP maxie
How is this not a dog of the pit bull category? The big dopey head, the streamlined ears when active, and the muscular physique. Looks like a staffy, which is counted among pit breeds
Fuck yeah dog! You go dog! I hope she's alright though
I know what to do, I'm a good dog.
How awesome that a dog is trained to absorb the blows and weight of a human head during a traumatic seizure. And not moving . Waiting for his master to be okay . What little troopers we have
Dogs, dude. Dogs.
Just another reason why man kind does not deserve dogs.
This is either a pit bull mix or another bully-breed mix if not a pit bull. regardless of breed this love and trust between dog an owner gave me the happy sniffly tears
The definition of training a service dog!
We don't deserve dogs!
We don't deserve dogs
And people say pitbulls are bad doggos
Its about time pit bulls were recognized for their many uses. Did you know pit bulls were bred as nanny dogs, to help watch small children? The more you know
That made me cry. I <3 pit bulls
What a beautifully trained service dog!
Pit bulls are a beautiful breed. It clearly shows it is not the breed that is dangerous, but the humans.
This was beautiful. To see dogs do such important things for their humans is so touching.
Such a good doggo.
I've never seen anything like this.  It's so amazing what dogs can do.  We're so lucky.
People who are shaming pitbulls are fucking stupid. Those dogs are the most loving breeds you can get, it's the owners responsibility to train their dog correctly. I've had two pits in my life, one when I was around 6 and another at 19. Both of them had/have zero problems in public, loved children and other dogs. Their loyal, protective and loving.
Pitbulls are great but according to the source video this is actually a Weimaraner/English Labrador mix. (The poster says so in the FAQ)
We don't deserve dogs. We probably never will.
Meanwhile a cat would be like.... "Ugh human?... Human? Feed me now!
Had a customer have a seizure when I was working at Home Depot; it hit her as she was sitting down on a low pallet of tile. She had her service dog in training with her, and as soon as we got the woman to the ground, her dog crawled under her right shoulder, prying upward. The pup got the customer on her side in record time. No hesitation. The best pup in the house. The service dog stayed there while I kept the seizing woman's head from knocking the ground until paramedics arrived. He/she may have been in training, but that lil doggo sure did their duty.
Dogs > cats
ITT:  people that didn't read the title.
ITT: People who can't read the fucking title.
Cats can do that!-Nobody
Dogs are better than people.
Omg! That pit bull is viciously trying to protect its owner! Someone stop it!
Gah we don't deserve dogs
Oooooooooooooo what a good boy!!!! <3
What a good boy!
*licks mutton chops*"job well done" -colt
That is fantastic. But I love the slightly sad look in the dog's eyes at the end "Oh well, I guess this is my life now". It's the same look I get when I perfect a task at work and discover it's rubbish
I fking love dogs
Dogs are the best. What else can you say.
What a good dog!
I miss my dog so much. :(
Dogs are so fucking amazing!
What a good boy
G O O D   B O Y E
Goes to show how smart and caring Pitbuls can actually be. Quite possibly my favorite breed of dog.
The comment section can't be that baa... oh man...
I'm not crying! I just have something in my eye
Give him all the medals
Animals are sensitive to changes in people's emotional state.  Has anyone ever watched **The Dog Whisperer**?  Cesar Millan has spent his life trying to understand how dogs can sense changes in an owner's physical condition and emotional state.  Service animals are legally allowed to accompany owners under many circumstances:      https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet
That is incredible. Dogs are incredible.We don't deserve dogs.
I wish I was a cuddle dog.
Sweet sweet puppy!!!!
Aww... one less human...
And my dog just shit on the couch. Sighhh... Pekingese. So cute. So dumb. So cute.
She's not actually having a seizure. She's training her dog to recognize when she is
G O O D B O Y !
I saw the video without reading the title first and thought to myself "why is this girl banging her head on the ground like a fish"
I feel like I just saw this.
How the fack did they train him to do that so carefully. My dog is two I think she finally has "shake"...and now she kinda just throws her paw at me whenever she wants attention, sometimes scratching my face
I love dogs so much fuck this was the best thing I've seen all week
Can you believe there are actually bastards out there cold hearted enough toHate these poor animals?
For a second, I thought it was a cat's head on a human body
This is disturbing me
i laughed
Having a dog is wonderful, great family members.
This is my dog when I'm trying to do crunches.. every time.
Now THAT is a good boy.
I'm glad she has this 🐕
Annnnddd here I am late afternoon, at work, crying. This is too cute.
This dog probably thinks his owner is extremely strange and is just in it for the treats.
😢 little pibble doing his human a service.
Try that with a cat... (rolls eyes)
He's not a Pit. He's a weimeraner/lab.
I would give this dog a medal for saving his owner....
I recently had some seizures and they took a big toll on my body. I scratched up my face, bit open my lip real bad, bruised both my arms, and even loosened some of my teeth. Seeing a dog protect their owner like that makes me want to get a service dog asap.
I'm suspicious that the dog isn't just looking for opportunistic patting.
This is too adorable!!
Damn I love dogs.  :')
ask not what your doggo can do for you—ask what you can do for your doggo.
Just here to say I wish my friend had this dog. He suffered from epilepsy...and died due to a massive head trauma. I would say that I'm extremely thankful to the people that train these animals to look after us humans. But part of me thinks that all animals look out for all living things...then I subscribed to r/natureisfuckingmetal and that removed that thought...but I never see a dog on there.Dogs are awesome
Makes me think how my Sam acted when he saw me have a seizure. He sort of stared at me when I opened my eyes and then when he detected my consciousness he wagged and dived on me but I wonder what his thoughts were when he had to watch me All by himself, makes me sad, I miss him
Mans best friend at work again. 🤘🏼really cool
Why does it say Not a Pitbull? Is it not?
Service dogs completly amaze me.
I like /u/gallowboob and I like /r/pitbulls
Good boy...or girl. Dogs are amazing. Im looking at my english springer now.  She's just chilling peacfully, staring across the back yard, sitting in the grass beneath our feet. A rare wind is blowing, the result of a needed rain. It's cool 88 in Austin from a ninety...SCORCH ur brain hot day. This Texan, Tejano is Drinking a Lone Star tall boy on a hamock chair swing on my deck. And I thank the universe for this day and im amazed at the courage people have. Like the lady in this video. Good doggo. I just used doggo publicly.
/u/GallowBoob Ngl i cried a little at this. I've never seen anything like it, thankyou.
I'm literally crying tears because dogs are so good and pure in this world. Dogs are amazing to learn this!
We've got the BEST DOGGO'S HAVEN'T WE FOLKS?!?!
Dogs are really heaven sent.
The title says "not a pitbull". How'd that get determined? Looks pretty pitty to me.
I'm not into dogs, but that right there? That's a good boy.
At first glance I thought this was a human with a cat head gasping for air.
Wow. Dogs are awesome. Probably better than humans I guess!
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Beyond awesome pup.
That's a *damn good dog*
we don't deserve dogs
Dogs are amazing animals!
TIL: Pirbulls are used as service dogs. TIAL: Pitbull service dogs are awesome.
This is too pure. What did we ever do to deserve dogs? 😭
Dogs are bros
We don't deserve dogs
We don't deserve dogs...
WHO'S A GOOD BOY
"Service dog job? Hmmm I dunno.......""You get lots of free pettings during a seizure.""Okay cool, sign me up!"
Now that's a VERY good boy
I love pitbulls and OP is pretty cool.
They really are a good dawg when properly trained and socialized.
Can we give his more upvotes!
Amazingly smart dog!!!
This is very heartwarming. Upvoted and faved
Cats wouldn't be good at this because they would just start playing with your hair
We do not deserve dogs. Do not care if it's a repost. Cannot be said enough.
They're like furry angels.
Good doggie!
Plot twist, the pup just wants cuddles. Still surprisingly effective!
This goodboy is going for 100k karma.Have an updoot good boy.
Look at the dog's eyes at the end! That made me cry
Why I love dogs
What a darling. As the mom of a child that has seizures,  this melts my heart.
It's probably already been said 1k times but needs to be said again. We do not deserve dogs.
Omg this made me tear up. Bless that pit bull ❤️
What did we do without them.
Holy fuck thats awesome!
We don't deserve the dogs, man
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dogs are amazing.
There are no words to describe how much this touched me on an emotional level and this coming from a person who is terrible at emotion almost to the lack there of.
Dogs are too good for this world. In a perfect world they would be the dominant species
Heartwarming.
This is awesome.  My pittie ate Taco Bell fire sauce out of the garbage today.  I'm gonna show him this.
TIL the most common neurological disease that dogs have are seizures.
It's derpy face at the end. "Me do a good boy job"
What did we do to deserve such unbelievably amazing doggos 😭
Dogs are awesome
So awesome!
My brother in law gets these awful attacks and it really sucks seeing someone you love.
Staffys/pittys make such good service dogs because they love their people so much. This is adorable to see. xx
My pit Hershey just passed away last Saturday. I've been very depressed and probably will be for a while now. Seeing this video has really given me a happy. Pitbulls are the best breed out there, hands down.
She has epilepsy and seeing a dog like this watching out for you.
That sweet look and the lick of the chops she gives when she knows she's done her job 😇good girl. (Just seems like a girl to me)
u/chriswaitforit see pibbles can be service dogs😍😍😍
Dogs are just amazing.
If you don’t get to someone who is having a seizure right away, can they die?
What a good boy
Relatively Irrelevant Question: How did they capture this footage? Is there just a camera on the ground to capture this part of the room?
I had a seizure at home sat on the sofa when I was home alone with my dog, I came round to him sat next to me with his head on my shoulder and his paw on my chest like he was checking I was okay. It seemed extra cute because he’s not allowed on the sofa usually
Such a good boy :)
Very good boy !
The look on the pups face makes me tear up a bit ehh
Pit Bulls and Pit mixes are absolutely wonderful dogs .. loving and gentle. I’ve had 2 in my life.  Humans are the problem.
Oh. I'm gonna cry. Sweet precious protector.
GOOD DOG
Becomes handy when you want a pillow but you're too lazy to get one!
And people complaint about pitbulls.
The goodest of good boys
Absolutely amazing. Pits get such a bad rep, but involving them in these types of programmes will slowly show society that this breed are the same as every other dog that gets adequate training.
Him do a protec
Good dog. Pits are so precious, I'm sure this little one will make an excellent service dog.
Idk even though it says not a Pitbull... Looks a lot like the one I had. Anyone that thinks they are predisposed to violence is just ignorant. Any breed can be trained to attack.  Two corgis attacked my Doberman/Rottweiler and he didn't retaliate.  He sat down and cried and had a slit ear from it.
There is no doubt in my mind that if I was having a seizure, my pit bull would step on me. She has absolutely zero self awareness. She's the best though and I love her. Such a good dog.
belly rubs with the head?weird, but OK.wag wag
No bad dogs. Only bad owners/trainers.
Someone please tell me what the fuck did we do to deserve dogs. What a beautiful, wholesome creature...
Pitbulls are such blessings.
Pitbulls rock. I miss my pit girl.
To whoever say pitbulls are aggressive, then you are wrong humans are the aggressive one that instigate they nature in such beautiful companions 😢
Pits get such a bad reputation. They are truly amazing dogs
That just melted my heart, I love dogs so much, pit-bulls are my favourite, so loving
pit bulls are the most loyal, protective, no nonsense dogs if treated and raised with respect.  best dog i have ever had.
A pit bull bite me a few weeks ago ( I'm a mailman ) can't ever be mad at such sweet dogs for protecting their homes. Also this is cute as hell
THE GOODEST BOY. 😭
I never thought I would enjoy having a cat as a pet but since living with my girlfriend who has a cat, I have learned that they can be very compassionate and a joy to be around. With that said, Chum (our cat) would never "stick his neck out" to protect me. This is why dogs will always be number one.
"We tried to teach a cat the same thing with an epileptic, but instead of helping the cat would go and turn on the strobe light"
I swear man. Pitties are about the most beautiful dogs ever. To my mind they truly are the most perfect breed of dog.
Pits are great dogs.  Too bad they get a bad rap from shitty owners.  While they are bred and trained to be killing machines, the ones that are trained to be kind make awesome pets.  R.I.P. Caesar, you misbehaving little shit.  You were still loads of fun.
Not that it matters but that's not a pitbull.  From the Youtube video, the owner says the dog is a Weimeraner/English Lab mix.
If you don't like pit bulls, I don't like you.
Wow. This is incredible. As someone who has seizures this hits close to home. Pit bulls rule!!!
There is such a terrible stigma around pits. They are incredibly warm and caring when raised with love. I love seeing examples that show the counter-narrative.
That's so awesome. How wonderful that woman and others suffering with seizures have a friend to help them prevent further injury.
I love pitties even more 💓
I just burst into tears
Good dog. Very good dog.
Aww, big scary pibble 💙💙
I was told in medical class not to hold their head. Don't do anything except clear the area of dangerous objects. But hell idk.
we humans don't deserve these wonderful, joy and love filled beings,
testtest
Why did this make me cry
This is Fucking outstanding........
I just hugged my pittie so hard.  Love this.
We don't deserve dogs.
*let the bodies hit the....floooooor*
This is not a good doggo. This is the best doggo.
I'm not crying. You're crying.
You're fuckin with my feels, Reddit. We seriously don't deserve good family members (I mean dogs)
We 100% do not deserve dogs.
I can't think of a reason for a camera to be pointed from that direction in a real life situation. I'm guessing this was staged.  Unless... oh my god the Roombas are watching us!
Literally front page yesterday.
My pit tries to do this and I don't even have seizures. Good doggo.
He protecHe attacBut most importantlyHe protec his owners head by laying it on his bac
And people say pit bulls are bad breeds. It just goes to show that it's not the animal but what you make the animal that counts, as this pit bull is clearly intelligent and compassionate enough to do its job and prevent injury, as opposed to causing injury which they're constantly slated for.
Most remarkable thing I've seen in a while. Pit bulls are so lovable and so caring for there owners! She chose a great service dog!
We literally don't deserve dogs <3
My dogs both do this without any training...they have different intentions, though. PAY ATTENTION TO US.
This is so amazing, it makes me tear up.
Wow, that's amazing.
What a good doggy
That is a very good dog.
Wow! Such a good boy!
I know I'm projecting, but seeing the look in the dogs eyes, it was afraid but so willing to protect her. I'm totally crying.
I want a dog
If my dog does this already (tried it out to see what he would do) does it mean he has potential to be a service animal?
If I had seizures like that, I wouldn't have laminate flooring.
Wow its just amazing how much animals care about us... it almost makes me cry. As someone who suffers from depression, i want a dog really bad
What a good boy (or girl).
Beautiful dog, but you're wrong about the breed - Colt is a lab/weimaraner (but just as good of a dog nonetheless)
Wow, that's amazing. Smart creatures they are!
reverse gif gets me everytime
well trained
Truly mankind's best friend.
Omg❤️❤️❤️I love how he's like " it's okay! I'll protect you friend :)"
And here I am and I can't even get my dog to stop pissing in the house.
Im just gonna type some stuff and say good boy
Good dog!
I love him so much.
I swear to god I saw this exact gif in the morning.
He knows exactly who's a good boy.
Absolutely amazing! Give that dog all the snacks.
Omg ! Cool
I cried watching this.
Who's a good boy???
Looks like Cosby was here.
Wow the human race truly don't deserve such amazing animals.
Good dog.
Good boy :)
No, you are crying.
Yeah, humans are not worthy of dogs. They are far too good to us.
Dogs Are The Best!
Can't figure out if this is cute or amazing so i'll just leave it at both.
[**Here's the original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/comments/6sab96/service_pitbull_training_to_protect_mamas_head/) YouTube video from last night via r/AnimalsBeingBros for anyone interested
can we do this with elected representatives?to the post itself - this is certainly uplifting, not sure if aww, if it weren't galloboob i'd upvote it for sure
I wouldn't be able to stop from laughing if I was the person training the dog to crawl under my face. My dog does this already if he can't see my face and i'm laying down.
Good boy
Why was this being recorded
Heartwarming stuff man. I fucking love my Staff.
Dogs are the best.
How the hell do you train a dog to do that?
This makes me emotional... thanks.
good pup!
Angel 😇
/r/Awwducational
Today at work i saw a service dog alert its owner that her blood sugar was getting low. It was amazing.
[deleted]
My eyes started tearing up:( that's so sweet and loving. I know that dog was trained but regardless that's so casting of him or her.
Fuck me. I love that dog
Well that's certainly something the NHS never offered me
That's amazing! What a good dog!
Was just now listening to a song posted yesterday, [Prismo - Hold On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU8OwUx_w3c) and it was just saying the lyric: "And I said Hey oh just let it go your struggles won't remain And I said Hey oh we're holding hope in wake of yesterdaySo hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on, hold on to me!"Right as the doggo snuggled his way under her. Bam waterworks all over the place. I'm a grown man, but damn that was amazing timing.
that sweet face!
Here. Bump on me instead. I'm softer. <3
There's quite a list of things that could not be done without trained dogs, come to think of it.
I have had epilepsy for like 12 years and never considered I could be eligible for something line that. Cool!
"I am pillow doge!"
When I had seizures, my dog would just sit on me lol
Couldn't that really hurt the dog if the seizure is violent enough?
Why is this post making me cry?
I remember laying down behind my old flatmate to stop him against the wall when he was having a seizure. Had some nasty bruises after that, a 15 stone guy can sure throw some power about when his brain decides to go nuclear.Is this physically safe for the dog?
Guud doggo
Goodboye Givin a soft
What a cute pupper. I have a small jack-chi that does this exact same thing, except he does it for attention, not to save me from anything... well maybe boredom.
This is literally one of the most adorable and sweetest things I've ever seen.
I freaking love dogs
DOGGO to the rescue.
I spoke to a gentleman at the grocery store today with a service dog. His dog was trained to position itself to catch the man when he would stumble due to a balance issue. Animals are amazing!
G O O D B O Y E
¡DALE!
is this staged?this looks staged
This is why animals are better than most humans
Dogs > cats all day every day.
Super cool. Could you also get carpet instead of hardwood to help mitigate any possible head trauma?
Seizure/epilepsy service animals are trained to either detect the change in chemicals or pick up on characteristics in their handlers to respond accordingly. Some of these animals will never respond to a chemical change but will know that a certain action dictates them to perform a task aka protecting her head when the dog sees her hitting it. It can be no different than teaching a dog to speak on command.
Cute
Who's recording this? Shouldn't they be helping?
So who filmed this while she was head banging
Expected more chomp.
That's just beautiful
Only been 12 hours since this was last on top of /all.
I had to watch it about ten times to realise whether that thing having a "seizure" on the floor was a human or not. Am I the only one...?
Awww good dog.
Good do...no, OUTSTANDING dog!
I need to teach my dog to do this for my Wife. Thankfully her Grand Mal are rare, but she's suffered so many concussions in the past year or so.
Reason why dogs are called man's best friend!
Falling and head injuries FROM falling are **so much more** terrifying than I realized before my little sister developed epilepsy, which is apparently pretty common in cognitively impaired kids. She didn't start having seizures until she was 16 and the first was in such a spectacularly bloody fashion that over 5 years later I'm STILL dealing with the fallout from the PTSD I developed (I've always had low-key anxiety, this spiked it into an entirely new level of "anything-and-everything can kill you")... let alone what my mom and sister have to live with.They have it mostly under control now and she doesn't have the grand mal seizures anymore but she'll still seize long enough to fall and then space out for a while. Poor kid's torn her ACL, had 2 black eyes, a broken nose, a bruised rib, more split lips than I can count, and she suction-cupped the small of her back to the side of the tub which turned her entire lower back green and purple, all in the last 3-4 months. I would LOVE for her to get a seizure dog.
I am continually amazed that we can train dogs for this sort of thing. I understand the mechanics of how they are able to sense these things, but the fact that they know to do something appropriate about it is really amazing.
That's amazing!
That is beautiful. What a good boy.
TIL my dog is trained to protect my head in case I ever have a seizure, cuz she does this shit without prompting.
What if they get smothered ?
He's a good boy.
"The camera slowly pans to the left revealing the shadowed figure of a cat slowly licking it's paw. He glances up to see what is causing the annoying noise that has distracted him from his important cleaning process. After realizing it's just the stupid dog heroically saving the stupid human without concern for its own body as it places itself between the floor and the stupid human's head. He watches for a few moments hoping the stupid dog would fail in its desperate attempt to keep the stupid human safe. He decides that this is getting boring and will now amuse himself by vomiting on the stupid human's pillow."
Someone please reverse this lol
I am I pit bull and I am offended by OP and her seizures
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4738  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/68505)
Omg what a champ haha
Goodest of the good boys! <3
Wow
I was very curious as to how you train a dog to do this. I was, let down.
This is one of the cooler things I've seen on here about dogs.
Is this a exercise to acclimate the pup? I've never witnessed a seizure that was that "controlled". My father use to have gran mal seizures, they were violent and hard, not like this.
So much dog love!
If we can create dogs out of wolves why cant we create good people out of shitty people?
OMG, I almost cried.
Awww, good dog.
Dogs are so loving and most of the times better than humans at understanding emotions !
I like how he's  just like "I love my job." theres just a satisfied look on hos face.
Omg, I love dogs.
My dog something similar when I'm doing push ups. And once, my sister told me she passed out and my dog ran to her quickly. Good thing my mother was there to take her to the hospital because I wasn't home. She's a good dog that loves us, and my family loves her.
Just a reminder that dogs are awesome animals. I can't wait to get a place of my own so I can get one.
God dammit dogs are the fucking best
THis is the sweetest thing I've seem all day. I volunteer at my local SPCA & there are so so many pit bulls that go unadopted cause of their reputation I guess, its sad really. Most are good dogs...
As an epileptic, I wish I had one of these little guys
*I'm sobbing.*
Well that made me cry... =)
Good dog.
I'm crying??
Good doggo.
<3 that sweet pibble face
Many epilepsy service dogs are actually trained to identify psychogenic spells that aren't epileptic seizures.  http://www.neurology.org/content/68/4/E2.full.pdf
I wish my dog gave a damn about me
Wonderful animal, dogs are amazing!
/r/MadeMeCry
What a beautiful animal.
Good doggo
"Oh, a massage session going on now!"
He's a good dog
The goodest boy I ever did see
:~((((( but also :~)))))
Crying 😭
TBH I thought her hair was a werewolfs face transforming.
So is no one going to point out that someone just filmed this and let the girl smack her head on the ground?Good dog?
Is it bad that the human looks more like a dog than the dog did?
Dogs are pure. Nothing more needs to be said.
We don't deserve dogs
"No human! The floor is hard, headbutt me instead!"
My dog literally ran straight into my nuts while I was watching this
We do not deserve dogs. Damn that's beautiful.
I have no idea how people live without dogs. Some people have apartments with rules against that, but if you are able to get a dog you should have one. They're fucking great. No better feeling after a shit day of work or school coming home to your dog that acts like he hasn't seen you in decades.
why is it filming
So who has the camera on the floor and is just watching
This made me shed some tears of joy!
That is impressive
I thought the girl was lying on her back. Scrolled through the comments and didn't understand why no one was commenting on crazy face. Scrolled back to video and realized that I was trippin'
Very good dog, but not great that he stopped to film it first
just get a floor made of pillows
I think he's just trying to chill.
Bless this pup, bless the trainer, and bless whoever realized the possibilities and benefits of service animals.  A strong bond of trust & love on both sides, and living fuller lives made possible.Thankyou!
This is love

Well, you know, it's just a dog, but that's really inspiring and moving
Teach it to dial 911 instead
This is my good news for the day.
Whatever type of dog that is, I love how they look very happy with themselves after their job is done :)
Good doggo
Was this not posted this morning?
Haha his face once he's under her it's like he knows he's doing his job and is saying "this will pass, don't worry."
This is so frickin amazing/cool. It trips me out how smart dogs are and what they can be trained to do.
Buddy, my mother's demon dog will turn from trying to murder me to a superhero when something is wrong around me. No training.
Oh my, I know we say it all the time but we really don't deserve dogs

Real life hachiko
I am old and grumpy but this just melted my heart.

When I suffered with epilepsy (thankfully I don't anymore) my dog used to just bark at me. Everytime. Maybe he thought he was gonna scare away the seizure lol. Who knows?? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Very cool (not to mention **cute**), but I was under the impression that the initial fall and tongue biting/ choking were the main dangers involved with seizures. Can the dog catch her too, cause thay would be so cool.
Who's going to set this to Smells like teen spirit?
And now I have a nightmare image of a woman convulsing on the floor and the poor dog laying there with her, in an empty house, until she dies, right there on the dog's side. . . .
This warmed my heart so much.Good boy.
Who's filming this?
r/thisismylifenow
i need such a pet :'(
more than a pet
What a great doggo
This is one of the most touching things I've ever seen. I don't care if the dog was trained or not, if the person is faking it to get a reaction from the pup. It's just touching, no explanation needed.
"Look at me, I'm a pillow!"
How come dogs can somehow sense things like Seizures, cancers and blood sugar levels?Humans are so boring, we grow fingernails...no special powers (excluding the fact we are the most sentient beings on earth)
Thats pretty cool.
What a good boy
Pure love.
Dogs are so great!
[deleted]
This is awesome. But if it were me and my pit in this situation, he would just lick my face...
My dog does this as well. When I lay on the floor she will do her best to force her way under me. Seems like a submissive/snuggle thing that has the added benefit of helping those who suffer siezures
I'm not crying, I'm just sweating from my eyeballs.
Ugh this makes me tear up just watching. I've had a few unknown seizures and it made me feel so good seeing how he was protecting her. hitting your head and waking up with that feeling is awful. good doggo.
We don't deserve the love of dogs
What a good boy (or girl), and what a blessing for that human.
Whoever is training this dog KUDOS. That is some difficult upper level work that dog is doing right there.
What a G O O D B O Y E
that is so cool.
That's amazing.
My hearrrrrrrrrrt ❤️❤️❤️
I don't understand what is having a seizure
Mans eternal best friend.
Having a seizure seems so scary to me. I hope to god I never have one.
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen
Amazing to know that this is a thing. When I was 7 or 8 my mother had a super intense grand mal. Cracked her head on the floor before I realized I should have placed something under her. To prevent anything further I put my foot under her head and kept it there, sock went from white to pure red, foot was bruised to hell. I'll never forget how quickly a small head injury can unload a pint of blood. Without anyone around it could have easily turned fatal. Since then she's owned dogs, they sense her auras before she does and make a point to sit by her side. I imagine this pitbull can do the same, at the first sign of one coming on it's likely preparing to go into action.As someone who now has epilepsy it might be time to get myself a dog.
Dogs don't live long enough.  We need therapy robots.
The goodest boy
It was probably answered but I dont have the gumption to read through over 1000 replies but does the doggo act quicker in real situations? It looks like he is taking his time.
I have a brother who has a seizure disorder and I wish he wasn't scared of dogs and I wasn't allergic to dogs it would be nice to know there was a dog that could help him if he has a seizure and I'm not there
The extent of animal intelligence and compassion never ceases to amaze.
That's the position I get in when I want to cuddle
This makes me want to cry. Animals are so smart. (Obviously I know this is a trained animal but it's amazing they can be trained to recognize the signs/behaviors).
My dog would t even look at me
Made me want to cry.
Good pup.
Dogs need to rule the world
Nah, the dog just likes back massages.
Couldn't help but [think of this](https://youtu.be/BKIgv8AhffA?t=1m40s)!

Further cements the fact that humans don't deserve dogs.

We are worthy
That's great dogs can help in this way ^^
I love this
What a goods pupper
THAT'S A GOOD BOY
Is this safe for the dogs?  I know kids who had seizures when I went to school and normally space is cleared for them cause they could harm themselves or others while they experienced their seizure. This is a serious question.
Another reason why dogs are better then cats
Very good dog.
Aww
Awesome..
Good dog.
Good dog!
He good puppy!
Such a good boy.
Bro best post on Reddit award
man this is crazy... but very sweet
Good boy.
Human doesn't damage head, doggie gets a free massage. Win/win.
This is absolutely amazing! Dogs are incredibly intelligent and sooo loving. Even though he's being trained to do this, he's so wants to do whatever will help his human! And humans can be so mean😡!
This is so sweet, what a good doggy.
My dog is better than any barometer. You know rain or a storm is coming. When she starts shaking and less on the floor.
Any time I see a post like this now I'm reminded of the dog trained to console an autistic person during an emotional breakdown. She was shot and killed by police a few weeks later, after neighbours said she was trying to commit suicide.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3433188/Asperger-s-sufferer-touched-hearts-sharing-footage-dog-helping-cope-meltdown-shot-killed-police-suicide-call.html

Awww! Baby puppy 🐾🐾💖
I'm a bit emotional today due to recent events but dogs are so so good. Good dogs.
Thats so cute
God I fucking love dogs!! They are the best thing in this planet of ours and I'm so glad I get to spend my life with such awesome companions. As I've gotten older I've started to hate people more but my love for dogs is ever growing.
Why does that guys name have a green shield next to it... I want one
Mr. Worldwide
Warms my heart seeing this not every pitbull is mean its all in how u raise them
Is that how seizure do to people?
Best thing I've seen all day. This is awesome that the dog has learned this. Lets just hope the dogs owner doesn't seize :(
Amazing
That's just so amazing❤️
What an awesome dawg
 As
What did we do to deserve dog as companions?
Why did this make me so emotional... love a pit <3
Outta curiosity, is a dog putting it's head beneath the head of someone seizuring up a safe thing? Someone with epilepsy told me once that when someone is convulsing they can seriously hurt others because their body practically becomes a rock.I'm not condemning or anything. I'm just curious. I do understand no one would put a dog's safety in jeopardy.
Dog: I need some body massage .
Dogs are amazing. This video is incredible.
someone is cutting onions...
Dogs are to good for us
beautiful dogy
This is the greatest thing I have seen today I really needed this thank you op
I love everything about this.
Who cares if it's not a pitbull?  Does it really make a difference?  Great video!
That's about the coolest thing I will see via the internet this year
I need a dog that will bang my head against the floor vs saving me, especially when I do stupid shit.
WOW! That almost brought me to tears.
I love how this is put in /r/aww
Is that why my dog hates it when I'm doing pushups or situps?
PITBULLS CONFIRMED BASEDDMX WAS RIGHThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfCYbT9n5u4
I love this, he's adorable. Doing his job.
This is great training for a dog!
That shit so cute
The boy who cried wolf
His face looks like,  "Am I doing this right?"
Beware of Dog..
Dogs are awesome !
Oh my god that made me tear up.
This is f**king amazing.
Service animals are such a blessing!
Gotta love animals. The things they can feel and detect!
Without guessing at what the dog is thinking about the situation. I'm amazed they managed to teach the dog the action that is required. I haven't had a dog in a long time. And to the best of my recollection, it's hard to teach a dog to do anything that it didn't already want to do. I have no idea how they might have gotten the dog to do this the first time around
Best thing I've seen all day.
Good dog!Dogs are so helpful. Mine does something similar when I am working out at home doing push ups or planks. He gets under me so it's easier to exercise. My performance increases drastically when he does this.
God damn dogs are just absolutely ***amazing***
Ohhhh what a precious baby!!!
He's like ohhhhyyyeeeaaaahhhh, human head hugs!!
I'm glad she has this dog ! She probably is very thankful !!!
Might not be a pit bull but it's certainly a good boye
Sweet baby❤️
It still amazes me how dogs can be trained for this. What would we do without them.
Believe it or not, when getting a Red Cross Life-Gaurd certification they specifically tell you not to do this, and nobody could tell me why I'm told not to put a rug or my hand underneath their head
No greater love
Dogs........fuckin eh man.
Mark my words, dogs will one day have civil rights, and likely learn how to speak (simple phrases). No greater friend to man.
Beautiful!
I am imagining the mouthful of hair
Wow.
That is so cool.
sucha guboy!
Dogs, as always, are better than people.
That's a cool ass dog!Service dogs rock!I wish nobody ever needed one but I'm eternally grateful for these beautiful loving animals and the love they give to their partners.*BUT* to the people who discriminate against pit bulls simply for being a pit bull (or any animal for its breed) would be the same type of person to discriminate against a person based on race or even just a stereotype. Harboring this type of mentality is just ignorant and shameful and should call for deep introspective to see who the real monster is.
this is sweet and sad but also just amazing, wow
Damn, when my dog had a seizure I freaked out and was damn near in tears. Yet here's a good boy just here to save their owner. Goodboy.
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen.

At​ quick heads up on this one that is one great doggo there.. could have titled it doggo helps rapper.
I 100% promise that if someone gives me one of these said dogs that I will 100% not abuse this ever time I want a pupper pillow. 100% promise.
That's a good dog
That is truly amazing.
I've had certain dogs that belong to friends that can tell when something is "off." None of the dogs I've ever owned have ever had that ability nor have they ever seemed particularly concerned after a seizure. Maybe I just have dogs that are assholes.
Oh my god I want to cry
Dog's like, "ok now a bit to the left, oooh yeah"
That is... amazing.
If you look at it just right she looks like she has a cat head
Good boy, you get all the treats!
This both warms my heart and breaks it at the same time.
Great dog, great help for someone!
Anyone with epilepsy tell me what having a seizure is like?
I'm convinced that dogs are better people than humans.
I found this really moving. What a wonderful thing to train a dog like this to do.
We, as a human race, do not deserve dogs.
That's a good pupper
/u/dwightsrights_
So smart!
So bad ass
Wow. That is seriously amazing
I love this!!!!
so much better than humans
That's amazing
I have epilepsy and I wish I had a dog like this.
Beautiful soul
This is incredible.
why does it say not a pitbull on top of the picture
Omg my heart!
😲
They really are a good dawg when properly trained and socialized.
I thought this was a person with a cat head for a while
*Sigh Damn dog...This is not the time to get a back back passage
That is incredible.
I've only personally witnessed one seizure in a person. Her movements (thrashings, really) were so violent. Do some people mildly seize? (For lack of a better term) f that dog got under her, he would have been crushed. It was awful.
aaaaaawwww my heart has melted......
Get that dog a treat
This is amazing.
Good boy!
Let's go 100k upvotes!!!!!!
I love dogs. Pitbulls were over rated. I would love to get a pitbull. :)

Dogs are really beautiful. They deserve everything for helping us (even if sometimes they "help" humans doing stupid, unnecessary shit for em and us) 🐶💕
I have a son and a daughter on the way. When they're old enough to help out with managing a pet, I'm getting a dog, hopefully like this one.
well actually pitbulls are is a misunderstand bred off doges

I hate that people have to live through stuff like this.
What a heckn swell pupper. Look at the good job he is doing!
PROTECTOR BOYE
Truly amazing animals.
Gosh, i want to hug that big puppy.
I'm not crying. It's just raining on my face
Atta fuckin boy
Serious question: if someone living alone with their service dog has a seizure, would the dog try to call(?) for help?I realize that people prone to seizures probably don't live on their own, but I'm concerned/curious.
How beautiful
The dog is like, "I like food" in such a serious situation lol. Cute af.
This actually made me curious.. do service dogs get really sad when this happens or do they not understand and just know what to do in the event?Stupid question maybe..
That dog should've called 911 instead.
I bet it just wants back rubs
Oh my goodness I can't imagine. This is the sweetest thing.
So beautiful..

And people abuse them daily!!
Good doggy
It's derpy face at the time to get one!
Okay thanks. That's good news.

If you saw the youtube video, the owner faints and has that first drop
What happened after that?
More like we picked the good dogs
Süré, whãtèvér.
Damn, a pitbull helping someone!  I can't believe it, not!!
It's amazing the connection we have with dogs.
I have new respect for pitbulls
Dogs are so good. We don't deserve them sometimes.

wow this is amazing!   I want a pitbull now
Their big heads are perfect for this
That... that truly is a guardian angel in a puppy’s disguise. Good pup.
This is making me tear up. Such a good doggie.
This is wonderful😇
*Heart breaks*
That’s just fucking amazing.
Bruh my dog does this also
Good doggo! We love you.
Why were they filming?
My lab spastically jumps on me every time I act like I’m hurt.
Why does the tag on this thread say "not a pitbull"? It's a pit bull...
Who's recording the video

I think pit bulls are so cute, I wish they didn't have such a bad reputation. How valid is the fear over pit bulls?
This must be training right.....because how the hell do you film something like this so perfectly
This is fake news
Farming for upvotes. Pit bulls hit the other day so expect this to continue. When reddit becomes predictable it becomes boring.
Tfw when mommy clinton loses the election
Love seeing all the stupid "we don't deserve dogs" when the whole reason they're domesticated is because of humans taming them for thousands and thousands of years, back to neanderthal days. So, ya, i'd say we kinda do deserve dogs, considering we've helped them evolve quite a bit and be able to live longer, healthier lives instead of being mangled out in nature by another predator. It's amazing that we've domesticated dogs enough for them to be able to learn things like this if trained well. Harsh reality that some people just don't get, I guess.
Kinda weird that you mention the breed. No other posts mentions non pit breeds when referring to service dogs, do they?I smell an agenda.
Totally vicious. No way should it be allowed around kids. It's clearly trying to get to get throat. /sJesus Christ, how could anyone hate this bundle of adorable? My dad's pitbull has gotten mean lately because he kicks the poor thing. But whenever I'm over there he's as sweet as could be, would never hurt a soul. Except maybe my dad.
train that dog to dunk some oreos in milk next and you've got a keeper!
This is so beautiful.

Fuck man, this shit hits too close to home. I just recently, in the last year, got diagnosed with epilepsy and seeing a dog do what humans can't comprehend at the time blows me away. Shit fucking sucks
Good dog
Dog:"free pets. Best job ever."
God damn it my first ever tears from a reddit post
Its amazing that the dog did this and all but wtf was the person who filmed this doing??
More like "pitbull takes advantage of situation to get free pats"
This is heartwarming, I had a pitbull and the love they give you is unbelievable
I like seeing "service" and "pitbull" together.
wonder if a cat would ever do that? nah....love dogs
My friend has a lab/pit bull cross this is really lovely though given the bred gets tons of flak
this is everything
This is not a pitbull.  She said herself this is a Weimaraner/lab mix.
Seizures can sometimes be violent.  I don't think a seizure victim should be slamming his/her head on a dog much less a pitbull who might take it the wrong way.
Seems like some serious cranial percussion is already transpiring before doggy gets in place.  A helmet makes more sense.
<3 dogs so much. Thanks for this OP.
We don't deserve dogs
Hmmmm, who put the camera so convenient ?
That's not gonna do shit.  Need to train the dog to soften the blow when the owner faints and has that first drop
We don't deserve dogs
It is a beautiful thing. We surely do not deserve dogs and their love. But we need them.
Dogs are such lovely hearts.
And people say all pitbulls are vicious
I don't believe the title is accurate (or is at least just a joke). You don't protect the head of seizure patient like this, and in fact you don't touch them at all.
I absolutely love pitbulls. They're such good dogs.
Always curious when I see these types of videos. But who sets up the camera.
What a good dog :)
The best boy? Maybe, just maybe.
My pitty does similiar thing and shes not even trained. Granted, she just wants my attention 24/7, but she is the most wellbehaved and best dog ive ever had.
And I'm not allowed to have a pit. Da fuck
Does this hurt the dog :(
fucking DOGS man..i love dogs
Nah fam he just wanted a massage
we don't deserve dogs.
We don't deserve dogs. 😢
Pit bulls are amazing animals, full of love. This good pup is an actual angel.
Very touching... But how/why was this being filmed? Genuine question, like... did they feel it coming on, where they exercising or something before the seizure came on?
All you people reporting a repost because its getting more fake internet points than money you'll make in 5 years.$_$
He protecBut mostly he attac
Man, It must be real annoying when she is just trying to give a blow job and the dog gets confused?

Such vicious killers. /sReally hope more people will understand that it's not the breed that's an issue. It's people who abuse and train them to be vicious that should be punished. I want to plant kisses all over this puppy 😍
Seizures aren't that calm
It's not the breed of dog, it's the training behind it.
Such a good pupper! Great camera angle too!

Another good reason not to ban pits, this isn't even a pit but most people watching won't notice that because of the similarities. I won't deny that pits bite a lot, but the statistics for them are inflated because of how often people can't recognize a pit from a lab mix or other mix breed.
We don't deserve dogs.
I feel like everyone is either hateful of pitbulls or have a pitbull agenda to pushThey're just another fuckin dog, get off it
It's a Pillow Pitty!
That's wild. We don't deserve dogs no matter what type.
We dont deserve them
This makes me want to cry. I grew up with pit bulls and very much love the breed.  My husband has epilepsy, so I've seen some pretty bad seizures and try to be with him if he's feeling unwell.  He can function without a service dog, but for those who cannot, I'd say pit bulls are best type of dog to have.
Camera man should definitely be trying to help.
Ok.. and who was filming?
So instead of helping you just sat there and recorded it?
Why is this being filmed?
So.... who set the camera up?
I think this is awsome, but I cant help but wonder how this was filmed...
Serious question: does the head move like this during a seizure ? Wouldn't the body flail as well?
What type of seizure is that?!
Getting rid of the hard wood floor would be another thing to consider
Is this practice or video of the real thing?
so I'm not sure how these videos are made. Does the subject know that the seizure is coming so places a video nearby to film it occur?
Wait, who is filming this and why aren't they doing anything?
You could get a helm....I guess vanity prevents that.
i really wonder if that dog knows whats happening and that her owner is having a seizure or if the dog just expects treats
Serious question - is that what a seizure looks like?
I imagine when she gives oral sex.....things get......weird.
/r/WhyWereTheyFilming
Who the fuck is recording this???
That's not how a sz looks like
Now if only they could be trained to turn the seizure victim on thier side to avoid choking...
Wtf is she doing on the floor
looks like a pseudoseizure.
Absolutely looks part pit. Looks exactly like my pit/lab
How did this get recorded?
I didn't realize this was on r/aww and I literally said aww out loud
And then it ate the kids.
Who's filming?
[deleted]
What's the point?  Any damage worth protecting against would have happened when she fell down and smashed her head into the floor.
Never seen a seizure that looks like that.
Is she having a karma seizure.
Did someone just set up a camera while she was having a seizure instead of helping her? How does something like this get filmed
[deleted]
Am I missing something? Why is this being recorded?
I love how animals basically trample on everything and everyone when they need to get comfortable
Im jealous at how comfy dogs can get on their first try.
This is basically my wife. "HEY ARE YOU AWAKE, OK I'M GONNA LAY ON YOU"
that's what happens when you leave the Labradoor open

How does this much cuteness exist?
Must animal species enjoys companionship. Sadly i hear time and time again from dog owners or cat owners that their pet doesn't need another companion as they spend plenty of time with their pet, they just forget that they sleep 8 hours every day and work 8 hours or more so thats 16 hours already every day their pet is alone. Or they will say oh but it will become less interested in me if i have another pet. That is definitely not my experience, quite the contrary. Pets give each other something that a human will never ever be able to provide.
Omg adorable! Beautiful dogs! I wanna jump threw my phone and steal 'em! My roommate had 2 adult dogs when my 2 were puppies. Watching them play and cuddle together was the best thing ever!
Sleep tight pupper
Do you think the shape of a dogs head makes them cuddle better? Dogs can just wedge into a spot.
Too pure for this world!
Thats gay

Puppies grow really fast. A few months from now and they wont even fit in there.
Shepherd pups are so gorgeous.
I love that puppies want to do this. If you look through my posts you can see the picture I posted a while back of my 9 month old Basset puppy sleeping on top of his nine-year-old Basset brother. He outweighed his brother considerably and was considerably larger even though he was considerably younger. He was so big it was hard to think of him as being a puppy. But he still loved to snuggle and when Barney, the older one, was dying of cancer, Murphy would curl up around him on the dog bed and keep him warm. It was so sweet.
This is the best thing I've ever seen😭😭😭
It’s so easy for my dogs to get comfortable. One of them will use the other as their pillow.
My heart aches now.

Fuck those chewey boxes. I have to load those into trucks at work and they’re heavy as fuck
awwwwwwwwww.
Is there a scientific reason why some dogs like to snuggle like this? Is it just for warmth or are some sort of doggy endorphins involved?
Now I feel even lonelier
Please post another one of them doing this a year from now.
How come when I try this, ny friends get all weird and kick me out of their apartment?
As a diabetic, I don't think I'm supposed to watch things this sweet.
I fucking hate cuddling when I'm awake. I get to hot too easily and uncomfortable immediately. But I've had girl friends stay over knowing I hate cuddling. Apparently if i'm already sleep, I not only accept it, I go full cuddle/spoon mode. I didn't know until one of my friends talked to me the next day and said "I thought you hated cuddling?" I am the sleeping dog.
Reminds me of the episode in Friends where Joey and Chandler discover that that are ideal napping partners.
I got kicked out of my apartment today for a bullshit reason but this somehow made my day okay.
I've always admired dog's/cat's ability to stay at the bottom of the pile for extended time periods.   Could they be having the same thought as us, "i want to move but cat looks so comfy"?Probably just too lazy.
I have a 12 year old male yellow lab and a two year old female German Shepherd. This post made me very happy.
So, when you get a new puppy and get a new puppy book? They all say not to let new puppy in your bed. So, like, all my new puppies? In bed within the first half hour. I regret NOTHING!
Cute puppo
Aww this is so cute!!!
I’m so high rigjt now, bur this is the cutest thing i have ever seen in my life
This reminds me of my 20 month old son when he doesn’t feel well. He will call me to lay down with him in his bed (he sleeps in a  queen bed with bed rails now), he waits until I am comfortable and then he crawls over and lays on top of my chest/stomach. ❤️
I don't know who did what to make us deserve dogs but damn, Im glad they did! This made my day!
This reminds me a lot of my dogs when they were pups.https://i.imgur.com/giIb0SJ.jpg

Can I find a partner like this
hey its me ur blanket
my heart is crying
How long have they known each other, are they dating?  It's cool that it's acceptable for animal friends to just decide to snuggle and take a nap together.  No matter how long I've known my human friends, it's awkward and weird do that if it's not a significant other.
Ohhhhh this poked my heart
Too much cute. Cannot compute.

This is by far the cutest thing ever.

I tried to get some boots for my Corgi like that but her little legs are too much like stumps.

God bless your work Frida.And God bless your handlers.
Goodest girl ever
Is there anywhere we may send treats and toys to her and all the other rescue dogs?
Aaaaaaaah the goggles!!!!!
Frida looks like she's about to give out some serious snuggles after saving everyone.
My mother was in Mexico City during the earthquake of 85 and from what my dad told me she helped out as a makeshift nurse to help out people. She went by Frida and she was the best mom ever, so naturally this gets my upvote and a smile from me :)
Angel covered in fur. Love.
Bless her soul 💗
She's a good girl ❤️
We don't deserve dogs
G L O V E B O Y E E
Never more fitting time than this for the phrase, "good dog"
And she has lovely little boots 🐶💖
People saw her coming and were like "Thank God It's Frida"
What has mankind done to deserve dogs?
r/dogswithjobs
What did we do to deserve dogs?
You can just call her Frida; animal names do not require quotation marks.
Fine. I'll ask.Why is Frida in quotation marks?
Wow! And she's a doge Marine!
Doggles.
Good girl!
Frida is so cool she puts up with doggles and dhoes and still does her job.
Is that a US Marine behind that good dog?Edit: apparently the Mexican federal police have a utility uniform with a copy of MARPAT.
We must knight her immediately!
Myheart.
You wanna get on my good side trump!? Give this dog a Medal of Honor for being a good doggo
She looks like she's about to say "I'm too old for this shit"
Good girl
She needs back socks!
I just made a noise I didn't know a 24 year old man could make seeing this.
V good Doggo!!
The goodest of girls
In the name of all that is holy, find this dog and do a "After I told her she's a good girl" meme photo.  PLEASE!!!!!
Isn't it amazing that if the saved people could have somehow, somewhere read their destinies where it would have been written: "Will almost die in an earthquake. Will be saved by a dog.", they would have definitely not believed it?
This shouldn't be on r/aww this should be on r/badassasfuck
She just does it for the treats. Dogs that are trained to find people like this have to be given treats after every person they find or else they stop looking for people. A bit greedy if you ask me.Just kidding of course, this dog is a hero :)
If pinned under some concrete or other heavy material, have a dog wearing goggles come up on me, I'd be comforted, assume gonna make it. Dog wearing goggles is some serious shit
It's fine that everyone is feeling joy for this wonderful hero Frida; however, one thing to keep in mind is that many of the heroes scouring rubble in this tragic event are going to possibly have severe health problems in the future months/years. Let's keep that in mind, because these people and animals are making a tremendous sacrifice. God bless Mexico! God bless America!
And was rewarded with 52 good girl
She should give back Marinas vest.
Got respect for Frida.
Meanwhile you have some shitty cultures out there, that are fine with eating dogs.
I'm surprised the rear paws aren't protected as well. After building collapses I'd expect there'd be broken glass everywhere. EDIT: NM https://i.imgur.com/bftD1Kp.jpg
What an amazing dog, Lassie ain't got nothing on Frida!
I'm wondering if she was named after the famous Mexican painter/icon [Frida Kahlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo)
¡Muchas gracias Frida! Eres una buena perra. :)
WTG Frida.  I'm also glad to see they are protecting her feet and her eyes!  Good Girl!
*If we could read the minds of animals, we would find only truths.*This quote explains all one needs to know about dogs.
Who's a good girl
Go Frida!!
/r/dogswithjobs
This dog is harder than I could ever hope to be
Anybody know of a way i can send this good girl some treats? Or make a donation to her, uh, work group?
As a former military member, where is her ear pro. She is not mission ready.
Good pupper
My dogs name is Frida too! She may or may not be as brave as this Frida.Edit: a letter
That's a good dog!
Top doggo.
That's one badass, Spanish-barking dog.
Good girl Frida. And good going for her handler.
Who's a good girl? yea you are aren't you!
HORAH
I fucking love frida
Go, Frida!
Good doggy!
Real heroes were goggles
#Present hero of the universe
Mexican Marines wear wear the same pattern as our Marines? Interesting.
It's amazing what dogs can do.
She got kitten mittens on! Lol
Good girl Frida. I'll buy you some rear shoes too if you need.
She's a hero the world needs.
Good puppy!
Who's a good hero??
Cute little thing, here have a karma
I hope those good things stay safe through aftershocks and secondary disasters, along with people of course. Her going into half-collapsed buildings is a really scary sight.
Bless this angel and everyone working to help the people in mexico. So heartbreaking
I've read that for really bad disasters, rescue dogs get sad when they can't find anyone alive. In such cases they'll have a rescuer pretend to be found by the dog to cheer the rescue pupper up. Such good puppers. The very best puppers.
Well. I should just give up now. This dog is far more than I could ever hope to be. A very good girl.
Look at her little goggles!
Good girl!
Awwwww so cute such a Hero dogo 😻🐩🐶🐶🐕🐶🐩🐕💕💕💕💕
Now THAT is a good dog!
Oh my lord those little doggo slippers and goggles. So cute
What a class a mother fucking bad ass. Good girl.
Frida Marina
Good puppy
But the name tag says Marina :O
Lil’ Sebastian’s legacy lives on, transcending species.
Does household dogs look at her and think man she's damn cool with qll that gear
Good dog.
DEM GOGGS DOE
Nah her names marina
Her vest clearly says Marina tho
I dunno, Looks like a Marina to me.
Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear the cutest damn doggy water shoes I've ever seen.
Sure her names not 'Marina'? xD
All doggos go to toy heaven. Every. Single. one. Of. Them.
52 confirmed good girls.
Good dog. However many pets she gets, it isn't enough.
She is Mexican celebrity now even my grandma told me about her
Hehe her little front shoes
I'm probably late to the party, but I was wondering,Can these dogs tell the difference between "practice" and the real thing? Would they have more urgency in a real live situation and can they also adapt better? I'm posing this question to all trained dogs; Sniffers, K-9, Guide dogs, etc
Marina is the Organisation she ,,works,, for
She is a strong dog and a good trainer
Jesus christ look at those little slippers. I. Can't. Handle. It.
Is there a way that I could donate some money towards buying Frida a toy or some treats?
What a heckin good doggo
Hard working dogs, hard working people. All with hearts of gold and souls headed to whatever the greatest rewards are for the good samaritans that help those who need it.
Frida is a good girl and hero for certain but the number saved in the earthquake was 12. She has over 50 saves in her career though. You may  be cool but never be Frida :) :)
Guess I'm just stoned but I read this title as Frida being a human woman and I didn't read the subreddit and thought it was an article about an amazing real life superhero till now
It’s unreal how amazing dogs are, they best give her the biggest damn treat ever, what a hero dog
/u/bexnoodles19
It's amazing what a trained animal and a human can do.
If only my Lab were that useful.
Good dog Frida!!
looks like diamond dog from MGS5
Good doggo
Good girl, Frida!
And still manages to look cute in that outfit, good dog.
The real MVP
She does in fact look like a hero. You can just tell by her eyes, she's been through/seen some shit.
Good girl
This is the best girl
Good girl! Good girl Frida!
What a good girl.
Look at those booties!
We should save 52 street dogs in her honor.
The goggles. Possibly one of the cutest things of all time.
i thing the name is marina
She's a good dog but hasn't saved 53 lives, only 12, and that's throughout her entire career, not just from this one Mexico earthquake.> "According to Mexican Naval Captain, De Fragata Israel Monterde, Frida has helped to locate 53 people throughout her career in various disaster zones across Mexico, Honduras, Ecuador and Haiti. Of those 53, 12 were found alive." - [BBC: Meet Frida, Mexico’s hero canine who’s saved 12 lives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/b71065eb-d88f-4db4-bbc0-95d885cc4886)
SUCH A GOOD DOGGO!!

"Oh Frida, what stops thine ears?"
Oops!
Good girl <3
She has front row digger protectors...so cute.
That dogs seen some shit
Her face is the epitome of casual badass to the highest degree:"What chu looking at huh. Here I go saving some lives again".
Happy Scrappy Hero Pup!
Too cute
Very good boy
I wish I could like quadruple-like this.
She deserves all the rubs and treats! Good girl Frida!!
My dumbass immediately went to "sure gloves on her front paws but not her rear ones?!" Digging dumbass....  Digging
Bless her heart! And everyone else that has helped and is helping!💜 praying for all those involved!💕
Friday the marina.
And how many lives has a cat saved
Good girl :)
I imagine she's seen a fair amount of gruesome shit in the process as well.
Of course! But seriously this dog has done more than anyone on my ship lol.
This is excellent, good girl
Who's a good girl?
Save me Frida!
Apparently she's an old sea dog.
Goggle rescue boofer, goggle rescue boof!, She rescue, she goggle, and boofs! Then boofs it again! She's a goggle rescue boof!

I’m glad she’s got her PPE on.

This picture was posted before, before the earthquake, good dog but no need to post fake commentaries.
Amazing dog. What a hero!!

New R6S operator leak confirmed
Tell me about her outfit! Are those dog-specific goggles or human goggles made doggy? Does she dig people out herself - is that why she needs the shoes? Does the vest serve a purpose or is it just for easy ID?Oh man.... I'm one of those people who sees a powerful lady and asks "who are you wearing?"
Go get 'me, Pup!!

What a good girl. Good pupper Frida
What an amazingly good girl! If I were trapped, and saw that sweet snout poke through the ruins to rescue me, I would be ecstatic. On second thought, I might think I had died and gone to heaven - where all good dogs go!!
Anyone in this thread who thinks we deserve dogs, doesn't deserve a dog.
Why is Frida wearing Marina's jacket?
Just another day on the job
10/10 would call her a good doggo
What a good girl!
I have always been a fan of Dogoggles.    Also, I know she's a working dog and I would only barely be able to refrain from scratching her muzzle and rubbing her ears.
Someone please Tell her she's a good doggo
Good girl Frida!!!
Good girl.
Op, it clear says marina on her vest.

Good girl!!! I hope her handlers reward her abundantly and give her lots of praise.

LOOK AT HER DOGGY SWIM SHOES
I head during 9/11 Steve Buscemi would hide in the over head compartment of the plane so the dogs would "rescue" him so the dogs do not get stressed or depressed when they didn't find any survivor.
Because she's a good girl.
Dogs are awesome
So cute
Why is “Frida”, in quotation marks?
Good dog.
Man’s best friend, forever and always
Dogs are awesome! But I'm a cat person.

Very nice good doggo.
Pretty much the definition of a good boy.

Is there an awards show for dogs in the line of duty yet? If not we should fund one. Frida is currently best dog in Mexico.
Dogception - we need to go deeper!
Why do only her front paws have boots?
Doggles!

She looks like she's seen hell. It's amazing how much emotion dogs can absorb..
That's a good pupper.
Frida is a hero.But she was made do it by man.That makes her a slave.
She looks exhausted
THE SHOES
A good boy has interesting googles hahaha
That's a badass dog holy crap
Whodagoodgirl
But what happened to Marina? :(
Good girl!
She looks badass af
She looks pretty sad...
Her eyes perfectly convey how I feel after a long work day.
Surely, her name is Marina.
FUCK yea! Do work, Frida! :"D
Good doggo.
Why's it say Marina on her if she's called Frida....
Can't stand glory dogs...
That's a good girl.
That dog looks like it has purpose.
Frida is awesome! Frida is good doggo.

Oh I thought her name was "Marina"
Someone (talking about you /u/Angmew) doesn't really read very careful, does he?
Can someone make sure trump sees this. You know just some more wood for the 🔥
Aww.  She looks tired. Sad.  I'm sure she smelled 10x that many that were gone already.  I saw a show about cadaver dogs, they get really depressed
Isn't she Marina?
Nice doggo
wow! awesome job
Love the boots.
Who do i make the cheque out to?
Awwwww adorable😭
Good girl.
Are those rat boots?
I don't know if someone asked this but why she has glowes(boots?) on her front paws but not on back ones? Bad English.
Oh good girl Johnathan
My hero
H E R O G U R L
The label says Marina... but oh well I guess yet an other woman that tells me a fake name. :(
Good girl!
I don't usually want to buy a dog a beer.
You may be cool but you will never be Frida
Frida people
Her name is MARINA pendejo
God bless Frida
So what happened to Marina, why is Frida wearing her work gear? It looks like there's more to the story.
Don't you mean "save" as well? What does she do to actually save people?
OMG, THOSE SOCKS
I like her little shoes.
My dog can't even find her ball cos its behind a plant pot.....but as much as I love hearing about hero dogs, I can't help but feel a bit sad that they won't ever truly understand how special they are & that not all dogs are capable of doing such an important & dangerous job. Its all in a days work for them.
The goodest of girls
is that a? no it can't be. aL E G E N D A R Y B O Y E ? ? ?
Quit your BS: her name’s Marina
Good girl
She even has tiny dog gloves
I believe that all dogs should replace humans in all jobs. Just sayin
And my dog just frightened herself with her own fart.
H E R O B O Y E...
That's >9000 in dog lifes
It's doggle time!
She looks sad :( As much as I admire service dogs sometimes the work they have to do is terrible and they don't get to choose. Well more accurately a good doggo does whatever makes their person happy.
That's awesome. She's done wonderful job. It's time now that she be retired. That's horrifying work.
That dog is a winner for sure! Well done boy!
Good Girl.
Good girl, Frida!
Frida está trabajando duro y ha encontrado a 52 personas en edificios derrumbados.Gracias Frida!
No wonder Frida sounded familiar, according YLE 12-year-old girl, Frida, [is trapped under a collapsed school building](https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9843282)  I hope all Fridas are okay soon...
Marina also sounds like a nice name for her.
Love her doggles
Man, look at this complete bad-ass!  Holy shit, you look good, girl.The eye protection has to be mirrored for the best effect.
She's a good girl 😊
My parents’ husky took on the role of referee for the cats. Whenever she hears growling or hissing she runs over and breaks it up.
“Come on man. He’s not worth it, you’re drunk. Let’s go.”
"Hold me back hold me back!""Ok."
"I'm gonna kick yer ass!""Nope, nope. We'll have none of that."
Just ruined Mitten’s street cred. Thanks Mom.
I love the dog in the background minding his own damn business 😂
I got myself a Basset Hound when I left my parents home, previously I had a German shepherd which I trained in my teens. Their character is quite different, one being a Hound and the other a Shepherd. On holidays at my parent's I took them both on a hike. The basset, as per usual tries to go in front tracking small prey ,which he does sometimes, even though I don't hunt, and he just stands there looking at the rabbit/mice when eventually he gets one out of hiding. That day he went and ran way too far. So I told my long-haired German Shepherd to go fetch him, he starts running and cuts right in front of the Basset's way looking at him. The small-legged Basset stops, looks at him and then tries to pass under the shepherd's watch, the shepherd barks at him and then the Basset comes running back to me. From then on, everytime the Basset would look like he would get away from near me,  the German Shepherd would run in front of him and bring him back.Genetics and instincts are something amazing.
This is why Golden’s are too pure for this world.
No people? Is this some post apocalyptic future where dogs and cats have taken over the planet and human's have perished?
Homeward Bound lll: 2 Sass 2 Furrious
I love how the cat doesn’t put up a fight as he’s carted back. Like this is definitely not the first time
Where in the hell does this scene take place...?
It's funny how much cats fight versus how much dogs fight. Our dog brawled probably one or two times in his lifetime. Our cat is surprisingly still alive with how much scars he's got. Village cats are hardcore.
When your drunk friend wants to start a fight.
I find the behaviour of dogs absolutely fascinating. Does anyone know, beyond cute ideas, why this dog does this? I'm really interested as to why this dog did this.
Don't talk to strangers!
"it's not worth it bro"
That's wonderfully adorable
Cat: “Aw, come on, man!!  I can take this guy!”Dog: “Nope, he’s gonna whoop your ass just like last time.”Cat: But...Dog: Nope.Cat:  “You better be glad he’s here! I’d..,”Dog: Nope.Cat: “@$&##%+&$!!!”Dog: “Shut up. Remember, I can whoop your ass too.”
A Golden, retrieval.
This is right up there with the gorilla that hates the rain
I love how the build-up is sooo majestic and then when he gets pulled back you can kinda _hear_ how ridiculous the situation is
Perfect title OP! This made me chuckle audibly in a quiet cafe, I know of no greater praise than that.
This is hands down the cutest thing I’ve ever seen on reddit. I challenge anyone to find something more adorable
Now that’s a golden version of retrieving
I love how the cat is just quietly hanging there like "mooooom, I wasn't really gonna hit him"
Older brothers rule
Actually this is in reverse. He’s not as good as the video makes him out to be.
That is toooo precious.
First video in the morning. This is definitely the best way to wake up.
Goldens are the peace keepers of the animal world.
This is the equivalent to your mother screaming at you to GIT BACK ON THIS STOOP (if you grew up in the 80’s and in a city)
r/animalsbeingbros
This is amazing. Makes me very happy. Source video pls
Loose, collar-less dogs are loving friends with a vidcious cat which is odd. It looks like the pup on the steps is talking smack to the other cat.Isle of Dogs was a great movie.
That cat just lost every shred of dignity he ever owned. Poor dear.
GO HOME YOU'RE DRUNK!
“Just let me go at him once!”May be he is acting up all because his brothers are Dawgs
Cat: You lucky I'm on probation.
Cat: "Mess with mittens, get these MITTE-"Dog:"nope"
I always find cats with leashes weird
There's a cat in the background about to yell 'Worldstar!'
Is this filmer the guy who documents the "dog gangs of New York"?
I feel bad for a cat. Gotta be emberrasing for him.
I have a lab and she’s super smart and I think I’ll always have labs...BUT Goldens seem to have this human-like ability to process information and react in the most perceptive, empathetic, and reasonable way.It’s weird how advanced they are in terms of emotion. Weird in the best way.
How embarrassing.
My Pomeranian is always the cat referee. We don't have a lot of fighting, but our one permanent cat is deaf and blind. Our dog is very protective of him. He is so wary when our fosters meet the cat and frequently breaks up play time.We also currently have a litter of kittens. Poor dog is so stressed out about keeping them safe.  https://imgur.com/RGJO6bq.jpg Tuukka and Stephen, BFFL'S
Dogs are even a cat's best friend .....
Mittens is a rebel who doesn't play by your rules but does the dogs
I like the of the other doggo sitting on the stairs wondering about stuff.
Such a good boy
I love how gently the golden grabs the leash and then just drags him up the stairs hahaha
When your drunk friend keeps trying to fight people at the bar.
Do people actually walk cats? I’ve been around dogs my whole life and never actually seen a cat on a leash out in public.
“What the hell, Walter?!”
Love this, I totally send my dog outside when my cat needs back up.
Dogs are so wonderful sometimes. <3
Retrievers gon' retrieve
Poor cat. You know the other cat was laughing his ass off.
The friend who always gets into fights, The friend who stops the fights and the friend who sits back and watches the whole thing while laughing.Just a typical night out.
Aaaawww
Cute cat :3
Yo hold me back son! Hold me back!
Its not worth it Mittens, that guy’s not worth it
That cat is so embarrassed.
Thought that was a lion coming into shot for a split secondcan't lie
I think it’s crazy one species can read another’s body language yet many humans remain clueless when an animal is pissed off.
Maybe the cat is wearing her leash just because of the dog. She certainly provokes every stranger. So the owner has trained  a pacifist safety dog team for her.
I too have a cat named [mittens](https://imgur.com/F4Din2v)
Damn! Dogs are saving our children from beaches, our cats from street fights, and ourselves from crippling panic attacks. What aren't they doing to fix our lives!?
This is so fucking amazing, i love goldens.
Stoop kid shouldn't leave his stoop!
Holy crap--this makes me want to get a golden to keep my cats in line!
Can you have a more loveable breed.
So cute😍😍

Official sneak peak- Homeward Bound: In The Streets
It's like a gang altercation, but for pets!
Mittens was about to fuck some shit up though
It's like my stronger friend when I tried to pick a fight with a guy who would beat my ass up ez
Hold me back! Hold me back, bro!
“Come on, Sassy, let’s go now.”“Shadow, I’m focusing right n—Ok. I guess I’m leaving. You got off easy on this one, pal!”
Wow animals are getting pretty smart
Golden retrievers are truly nature’s perfect mother.
Retriever doing retrievy stuff
This deescalated quickly
"dude, seriously? We've been over this, that cat is twice your size, come on we're going home, be the better cat""IMMA RIP HIS FOOKIN HEAD M8 I SWEAR ON ME MUM""yeah yeah, let's keep moving before you get hurt"
That cat is not a Mittens. I see no markings on those paws
WHEN dogs tell you no more fighting
The two goldens were having a nice conversation in the back, then they look and see Mittens getting ready to fight."Oh gosh, there goes Mittens again. Give me a second, I'll be right back."
That dog is the cat's therapy dog.
“It’s over mittens! I have the high ground.”“You underestimate my pow-““Human said no fighting”“Dammit this is an acting class!!”
My Weimaraner did this to his cat once when a stray tried to make our backyard its home. I had the cat on a leash but my Weimaraner came over and picked up his cat (he picked the kitten up in his mouth out of a box of free to good home kittens and that's how we got the cat) and started walking towards the porch till he realized the cat was still on a leash and just game me this bewildered and annoyed look that made me think "I don't want my cat getting Feline AIDS fucker, let's go." Got my spray bottle of vinegar and tagged the stray till it went away. Got me some roosters the following week from my cousin's farmstead. So now we got no snakes, coons, or stray cats in our backyard. At least no living ones. Had to toss a coon carcass they were eating from in the black fly larvae box for my aquaponics system and give the brothers some black fly larvae for their good work (chickens love black fly larvae).

My parents’ husky took on the role of referee for the cats. Whenever she hears growling or hissing she runs over and breaks it up.
Mittens had the low ground, the battle was already lost. The dog saved Mitten's life that day.
I am genuinely curious why it seems that dogs always break up cat fights.
Mittens: "you're lucky hes holding me back bitch!"...10 seconds later...Mittens: "aww thank god you saved me, jim"
Doggos are so much more intelligent than we give them credit for.

The fuck,  why did reddit notify me of this?
Herding cats.
"Dammit Bob, why do you always wanna fight someone when you're high on catnip?"
Cat on a leash! Hilarious
Man, I swear dogs have special predisposition toward harm prevention. On 2 different occasions and with 2 different dogs, one would always run over and paw me over whenever I start nervously biting my nails and another broke up a fight between my ex and I. He was watching us having an argument on the sofa and as temper rose as we got louder and louder. Finally he jumped on to the sofa and also lodged himself between us while pawing my face to shut the fuck up (he was my dog so he felt comfortable doing that).Cracked us up and stopped the fight cold, and I still have flashbacks of his human-like, genuinely concerned face pawing at my lips to this day.
That's a brave Goldie... That cat was set on flip out mode.

This is the best thing I've seen in a while. The stare down, the posturing, the good boi being a good boi, the other good boi looking on like it's just another Thursday night..
Looks like mom forced doggo to take little cat bro out with him. Other doggo has a shit eating grin; probably an only child that doesn't have to deal with annoying younger siblings.
Mittens just gives up on life immediately
I wonder if cats would do the same thing if two dogs started fighting.Nah, who are we kidding. They'd probably instigate that shit.
Mittens was fixin to get his butt whupped, that big ole street cat looked mean.
Thats just like me and my ex wife, but the cat doesnt have my house, car and kids.

I did not know where this was going. It was like a great Thriller with a Comedic ending.
This is it, this is the greatest thing I've seen on the internet.
That one friend that prevents you from making an ass of yourself when you're drunk.
So thats why they are called retrievers. I get it.
 I love how the cat is like, “wait. No, hang on, what is happening... fine, god damnit.”
Hold me back ~~dawg~~ dog
Somebody needs to make a gif of this with some funny dialogue-captions added.
We had gotten kittens and wanted to see how they would react to the outdoors. We lived on a busy street so we were unsure if we should let them out. My cat bolted toward the front yard immediately. My 10 year old German Shepherd hunted him down, and carried him by the scruff of his neck in her teeth back to us and dropped him at our feet. Sweetest thing ever and maybe saved his life.
Me.When I go out to the bar with my friends.I'm the cat

That's one humiliated cat.
What type of savage puts a harness on a cat LOL!!! This is hilarious
There was this big football player in high school who would break up fights, literally pulling the smaller kids off one another... He was quite the role model and nobody ever really got mad for it.
Dogs are such nice peoples

Lmfao that’s actually hilarious. Is the dog like messing with the cat or is it trained to do that?
That looked like someone could have taken advantage of the cat and done some cheesin
We need a dog like this for our cat.
Wait... why was the person recording in the first place?
This video is great !!

Isn't it normal dog behavior to try to break up fights when they see it?

Walk softly, carry a big stick.  *check*
Now you have to throw it for him.

Now that's a beautiful repost :')

Such strength dude!
Grabbing the limb at the dead center is admirable.The pride in the gait is just beautiful.
You know, this really makes me think about the functional uses of fetch. You, caveman, must tend to fire, but need more sticks. Good doggo solves this problem
He looks like a little plane coming in to land.
Is it just me, or does the stick... BRANCH sort of look photoshopped?
I don’t mean to shit on anyone’s parade but this is definitely CG, right? Everything looks fake to me. Plus the right side of the stick he’s carrying somehow phases into the ground? Idk. Not that that makes the video any less enjoyable. It’s just jarring to me.
He looks like he’s about to set off on the first flight
The only proud boy worth keeping.
Pretty sure its fake. Right tip of the stick disappears when it touches the ground. Still cute though.
Now let's see the dog navigate with that giant stick across a narrow foot bridge.
I thought of the Wright brothers

Damn scary! Why does the stick disappear into the ground though, why the edit?
Looks fake. The right side of the log goes into the ground
Don't wanna get bit by a dog with that mouth strength
Did he take down that tree as well?
My dog does those same little quick steps when he's carrying a heavy stick/log, I love it.  There's a big felled branch on our walking path which is about the size of a large Christmas tree, and every day he has a go at bringing it home.

A 100k repost. Great job!
This is my stick. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My stick is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My stick, without me, is useless. Without my stick, I am useless. I must fetch my stick true. I must fetch quicker than retrievers and spaniels who are trying to steal from me. I must fetch sticks before they fetch before me. And I will.
I've literally said this before and here I find myself saying it again...what's with these gifs of dogs with photoshopped oversized-sticks?
my brother's border collie loooooved fetch. on walks she would find sticks and bring them to us to throw for her. walking along the beach there's a telephone pole-sized tree that had washed up. she stops at it, looks hard, then looks back at me. i give her the dog head turn. "what?" she looks back at the "stick", then back at me with the "this-one-seems-good look". i say, "yeah. probably not". she continues her search for a good throwing stick
Fake or not this is a VERY good boy
Too bad it’s a fake.
This is funny but fake look at the right of the stick it sinks into the ground.
Perfectly balanced
Awww...he is such a cutie pie!  Now how are you going to throw it so he can fetch it again??
This is almost the perfect little gif for what I've been looking for nearly all night. Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.Good doggo and human
Tipping forward and walking on his front 2 legs is the only thing that could improve this video.  But, omg, I love!
#SPEED WADDLE
I once had a staffy like this. She would also obsessively lick paint off walls and dive for rocks, massive rocks. Best dogs.
HIS LIL LEGGERSThis is one of the first times that I legitimately can't even.
To all of the people who think this is fake you should spend more time with dogs.  There was a dog in my neighborhood who would drag trees like that out of the river.  My medium sized female dog regularly picks up logs her own weight.  Dogs are very strong.
Yeah, edited. Watch the stick go through the ground at the beginning.
Every time I see this, I look at my pibble and think "yep, I could see her doing that."
It’s so much bigger than he is!

Not going to lie, saw the title and thought I’d get to see one of those douchey white nationalists get a beat down. Not totally disappointed with what I got but hopes were still dashed.
Maybe it’s just a tiny dog with a normal sized stick.
I'm impressed that he found the exact balance point of the log. Most humans couldn't do that.
So that's how the pyramids were built. They had dogs do all of this stuff...

Has there ever been a boy this good in recorded human history
This makes my teeth hurt
I always thought that dogs were domesticated to help with hunting, fending off attackers, etc.These are masculine endeavors.  I just suddenly realized that maybe that's a long-con cover story because the real reason they got so friendly with us is that they'd bring firewood to the women to start a fire.
He's gona be disappointed when his human can't throw it very far...at all lol
lol. Have fun throwing that for him!
Excellent command of pitch yaw and roll on this pupper
It's like a kid finding a dog. "Can i keep it? Can I keep it?"
The sheer force of dogs never ceases to amaze me.If I had to carry a proportionally large object I would probably stumble and pierce myself through in a matter of seconds.

No aww post can make me like pits. I get that a lot of their bad behavior is due to bad owners but they were bred for murder and it's in their dna. Even good owners can't fully control their pits.

good luck throwing that very far
Kind of looks like a bone mustache.
Someone needs to edit it so he takes off.
Look at the tippy taps, so determined, so excited
Do you guys think dogs’ obsession with sticks is due to a biological drive base in selective breeding to help us gather firewood?
Again?
Awww
A friend’s dog did something like this - after a big storm I took him for a walk in the park, and he found a sapling that had been totally blown out of the ground.  It was a bit thinner, but still had roots and all the branches and leaves and he had to drag it over but he was so Proust of himself!  I was very sorry I couldn’t throw it for him, but I did tear off a branch for him instead. He was a skinny spaniel cross too, so it was quite impressive he managed it.
I instinctively protected my shins. My doggies didn't raise no fool!
This should be some kind of world record
He has a proud walk.
Stick? That's a tree branch.
That dog's name? Gavin McInnes.
What’s the psychology behind this?
Sometimes I wonder if cavemen genuinely appreciated things like this. Like that’s basically free housing material you didn’t have to lug, right? Or firewood. I bet the first dog to bring a guy a big stick got a pretty great response.
Fake
is that eastbourne
I think this is the most reposted gif i have seen on reddit. Its cute and all but now that i have seen it like 200 times im tired of it now.
Reddit is confirmed to be ok with proud boys.
Is that an airplane propeller?
VROOOOOM
Paging u/bellevis
That balance is beyond a good boy, most dogs would drag that stick
perfectly balanced
Whos a good boi?
The absolute strength in this animal is mind blowing. I bet most humans could not pick up that branch. Theres a reason dogs like this were used for hunting.
Those.feet.
Now that is a cute pet
Proud doggo
Is it a dog or a beaver?
I need this kind of balancing in my life.
General reposti, you are a bold one.

Does the pitbull really have the strongest jaws?
Me: okay, you can eat one more snack today but only ONEMy girlfriend:
Where did he even find that
This young man strong as hell.
How tf is he still upright
I thought it was totally fake but it's not.[What is real life?](https://youtu.be/QMGG57MaSGc)
Definitely rotted. As in the branch.
Alt right dog
The goodest boy
Damn, I can't wait to get home and hug my dogs!!
'comment about bite and neck strength of the pitbulls'
My Staffie did this all the time, never found one this big though!Quick story. Leon (as was his name) obviously loved his sticks and in the forest we took him for walks in was a rope swing. For whatever reason he'd always ignored it till one day he suddenly bolted out of the car door ran in the direction of the swing. I'd probably lost him for a good couple minutes and much to my amusement when I did find him he was hanging in mid air on the swing (made from a nice long solid stick) swaying back and forth. Wish we had mobile phone video cameras in those days, but it was hilarious.He would not let go of it either.
He's just working out...
He looks so proud and happy :D
Top dog gets the upvote. I actually laughed out loud thank you
I'm hearing theme from The Dambusters movie
Dog: Throw this one muthaf***er!
That’s some determination. His face is screaming “fuck this is ripping out my teeth, but fuck! what a catch, check this shit out human!”
Oml
You sly dog! You had log!
Looks like he tore down the second to last tree out in that field
This guy
Wonder how far he carried that
Where the fuck did he carry it from? The video starts him off in the middle of the field!
Big stick energy
The little tippy taps are adorable.
There are two people on this thread. Those who are lovin this good boys goodness. And killjoys
I swear I've seen this before
The stick looks edited in....
It’s like a plane taking off the runway
BIGGEST STICK IS BEST STICK
Looks like a plane landing in a bad crosswind :p
Hahahahaha this is the most hilarious thing ever.
That walk is so cute, he is so proud of himself. I love it!!! ovo
It’s my birthday
That’s the whole limb, not a stick. The goodest boi
That’s a strong boy

Wow! This is certainly the most adorable!

I always expect him to take off. Every time.
Can someone make him take off eventually?
Kuubuu found a stick for mommy!

Think he's compensating for something?
We don’t deserve dogs
Big stick for a cute little dog 😀
That must be a pretty strong dog to be able to carry it!
He must have neckmuscles Goku would be jealous of.
Did it take off into the air anytime while doing this?
All dogs are best boys but best stick it best stick
From the preview I thought it was an archaic plane start :-P

Strong dog.  Push stick through earth on right side...  rollseyes...
r/tippytaps
Cute but would be better if It didin't clip Into the ground on the right side xd
Perfectly balanced
Expected him to take off and become an air doggo
He looks like he's about to take flight!
Looks like one of those tiny propeller planes landing on a makeshift airstrip. Even sways with the wind!
Do you live like a 100 feet from the edge of the earth? Flat earth nerds are gonna jizz when they see this!
That balance tho...
Omg that’s not a stick, that’s a big ass branch.
Thank you so much. I was having a bad day.
He could take off with that thing if he runs fast enough.
Shopped or nah?
That boi absolutely has Big Stick Energy.
Pitty strength!!!
The dog is finding the balance! It's cute.

Someone needs to edit the gif so little pup takes off like a plane
You're all wrong, he's clearly trying to hang glide.
It‘s photoshopped, the shadow glitches.
He's so happy doing what he's doing even when he's tired,its a less that we should never give up on life even when we seem to have failed or tired, keep moving..
Does a good job of balancing the weight while trotting right along
When yo Dawg pull up wit a shtick
There wasn't much weight on those back legs.

That’s a bull sized stick he got there
"Boy... That is NOT a stick. That's a whole log!"
Geeeeeez Louise!
The size of a human

Ah the Scottish caber fetch breed
Big stick energy
This is actually a reposting account.
quite a sticky situation
Clear the runway. It's time for takeoff!
I thought that was a shoddily planned homemade plane at first. I was wondering why the wings were so crooked.
“Dad, We’ll never lose this one......we can play forever”
I hiked for 28 days in the Northern Siskiyous with a dog who looked and acted like this. Spent 28 days of getting thwacked on the calves by the good girl hauling logs while running past everyone.She made up for it by crawling into my bag with me at night and keeping me warm.
That's one strong boy.
This is the best GIF I've seen this year
i thought of the pirates of the carribean song while watching this😂
Chuck Norris' dog.
My dog is the same way. He would bring back a redwood if he could
Giant boomarang! <3
This is clearly fake, the thread was locked and reopened, why haven't the mods still taken it down?
Perfectly balanced.
He looks like a fucking airplane trying to take off !!
tfw I thought this was a political statement
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Cute
Got that big stick energy
I was expecting him to take off
What's with staffies always grabbing the nearest tree and dragging home? Every damn walk was like "where's the stick boy find a stick there's a little O FFS PUT THE FUCKING PINE TREE DOWN BOBO!"
😂
Major Big stick energy
Can someone please photoshop so he’s soaring through the sky!
his little feetsies are making me the happiest i have ever been ❤️
His jaws got grrrrreat grrrrrip strength
At first glance I thought it was a small plane tracking the runway through windy conditions
Had balanced so well, almost like it never bounces lol.
Tell me which toothpaste and toothbrush!
Seems right.A friend’s pit that was about the size of a small horse loved to get a downed branch or log and bring it over to you like it was fetch time.Good demo of how they are terrifying lumps of jaws and muscle, but are just as much of a derp as any other breed.
Now you’ll have to reward him with a treat just as big.. Just... do it.
Look at those tippy taps
Looks more like best stick found proud boy
Holy shit Clifford is a lot smaller in real life
His little white socks make him look like he's going so fast!
Behind the gif: https://katraccoon.com/comics/behind-the-gifs/lonely-giant
Haul training progress: 7/7
He got a real nice one there
He walks like Gromit
Holy shit that dog must have some hella strong neck and jaw muscles.
“Dad, get the car. We uhh... gotta go... now!”
Why did the video stop before he took flight????
Did you have a falling out? Seems he’s starting to build a wall through your swamp.
Does anyone else hear that noise when mr.krabs walks?
Best stick for the best boy
Ah, a a great Scottish tradition. Fetching the Caber.
 A rock, stick, squirrel, it was crazy.
That’s a strong mofo
That’s not a stick at all! That’s a dinosaur bone! /s
This is one strong dog. His neck and mouth have to be at least level 8999.
SMALL BOYE BIG STICC
Oh my god, look how fast he’s running! He’s so excited!
“Get the fucking car, get the fucking car, get the fucking car...”
Some say he's still runnin
You can see the end of the stick clipping into the ground. Is shopped.
With that much weight I'm sure he's walking like a person on his front legs and his back ones are just moving by habit.
Casually carries stick
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/6UcnT
Big sticko, goodest pupper
“Mum, mum, mum! Look what I found! Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy!!!!!”
He reminds me of those guys in World’s Strongest Man competitions, carrying heavy shit.
Lol good boy finds a tree :)
Every time I get an idea to start a business :p
Despite a promising start to “PBLSCC” (Pit bull large stick crowd control) program and successful Beta testing in controlled environments. The program was undone at its first real life deployment in magnificent chaos. The closing documentation refers to the incident simply as “Squirrel”.
Those feet. My god.
At the beginning when I scrolled down and saw the video I thought it was eagle flying.

I think Samoyeds are so freakin' cute. Does anyone have one, and if so, how would you describe the breed in general from your experience?
Can anyone tell me what breed this is? Googling "cloud dog" was inconclusive
You thought I was sleeping?Acting.
Of course when a dog does it, it's cute. [But when I do it](http://gfycat.com/meatycaninedeviltasmanian), it's a formal discussion with my boss.

What breed is your dog? He looks like mine, that I have always considered a mutt.
Is it hard to keep a Samoyd reasonably clean?I am very familiar with Northern breeds and social/exercise requirements, but that white coat makes me reluctant to consider the breed.
His 1-2 crossover paw work was top notch.Edit: or her

Cloud doggo needs rests.
My first dog will definitely be a Samoyed :D
Thats how everytime i  mediate and end up falling asleep.
Reminds me of a doggo I met while on vacation as a kid. The place we stayed had a couple of house dogs and one was severely abused as a puppy before being adopted by the owner we stayed with. As a result he would never lie down to sleep. He always fell asleep standing up and then would fall on his face after a few minutes. We felt so bad for the poor guy, but towards the end of our week long stay he had become so comfortable with us that he started to lay down to nap! It made 10 year old me so happy to see that.
This reminds me of my cousins dog, who is the same breed. His name is Celsius and is a very good boye :)
Is this in an IKEA store?
My dog is clever enough to be on the couch when he starts to drift off

My cat does this. I have no idea how he can be tired after 18 hours of naps, and somehow doesn’t need to rest his head to sleep either.

Happened to me at a town hall meeting once..
Adorable !
The dog pound likes to party aaaaaaaall niiiiiiiight looooooong. Til' when?
I know how he feels
I’d be falling asleep too if I were wrapped in that comfy cloudlike fur
if that would be my dog i would just pick him up and cuddle with it on my couch till we both fall asleep
I think this is actually falling awake
2 secs into sleep mode and he gives you that look
OMG! This pupper is so cute! What type of Doggo is he/she?
Watching CNN AGAIN?
I think this is perhaps the most chill cloud I've ever seen.
America's opioid problem is worse than I thought.

He listened his boss tirade about digging bone 🍖 in yard.
What a beautiful dog!
Mr. Bright side
Aw, he looks like he's actually sad that someone was watching him, haha
He's falling asleep, And I'm petting a lab
That confused look after he wakes is what does it for me
*This* is what the opiate epidemic looks like. ☹️ poor doggo needs to get help.
I scrolled past this multiple times thinking it was a photo
Ohh that’s a puppy I could snuggle and nap with 🤗🤗
Just like me when I’m in lectures
That cute face...."I didn't fall right "
That is a cute and fluffy dog.

Poor puppy got them swoop downs in hims stance <3
When you in the barber chair but you're  too relaxed

That dog needs rehab.
those sad eyes after! ‘Why do you betray me hooman’
The most impressive part of this video is the lack of dog hair on the floors and stools
Nodding out oh yeah
Have you spoken to your pupper about rehab and living a substance free life?
REPOST!!

Me at my desk at around 3:30
I like how the dog matches the decor
I think he’s dreaming about being in school
I used to have three dogs in the house, one was an australian shepherd that was the most intelligent animal i have ever known.    When ever the other two dogs were doing something bad some where else in the house the aussie used to find me and sit next to me  so i could see he wasn't involved.    Any time that dog came into the room and sat  at attention I just knew it was time to go investigate what the others were up to.
Dude if the cat is ashamed someone is probably dead.
The dog looks like it's taking legal advice from the cat.
Well let's start with my heart.
Poop in shoes?
It's nice that it was a team effort.
[A truly repentant dog](https://imgur.com/u7A2lJw)
I bark the fifth.
someone pooped in the house and the other ate it.  My golden used to constantly eat my orange cats poop.  no idea why but it was obvious.  I swear my golden enjoyed poop more than any other food.
Please keep us updated!
One time my family came home from dinner and our dog, who usually greeted us, sunkered away in the living room instead. I knew something was up so I ran around the house trying to find what I knew was going to be poop so I could clean it up before mom found out and threw a fit. Lucky never would have been able to understand, but it was found downstairs and i cleaned it and none were the wiser... RIP Lucky dog
We need an update!
Just my gut instinct, but the cat is guilty.
Please let us know when you find out what they did.... other than breaking a few reddit hearts
Cat is telling Dog all the horrible things about humans. Dog's mind can barely handle it.
I FORGIVE THEM
Cat: “don’t make eye contact”Dog: “too late. They’re on to us”
Curious minds want to know.... What did they do?
Cat: "Take the heat for this and I promise much treats. Trust me. Shh, he's watching."
If I was a dog, I’d purposely look guilty on occasion just to mess with my owners head. I’d watch him/her go crazy frantically looking around the house, to not find anything destroyed or puked/pooped/peed on.
CAT: Yo man. Keep it all the way G my G, you don’t say *shit*, y’hear me?DOG: Yo Devaughn, I don’t think I’m strong enough for this.DEVAUGHN: Yo what did you just call me?
Something interesting I heard recently in a Terry Gross Fresh Air interview:>Some of the experiments I do are testing, for instance, anthropomorphisms, attributions that we make of dogs. One of my favorites was of the guilty look. Dogs show this guilty look, pulling their ears back and pulling their tail under their body or turning away. Often, owners know when they've done something wrong. So it's fair for people to say that dogs look guilty. But I thought, that's a strange attribution. How can we be sure that dogs are guilty? And so I did a little test to see if the guilty look popped up only when they'd done something wrong or in any other circumstance.>GROSS: What did you find?>HOROWITZ: And it's a really simple experiment. And I found that the guilty look showed up more often when they were being scolded or about to be scolded by their owners, whether or not they'd done something wrong. And so it looks like we really prompt the dogs to put on this look, which is probably more aptly described as a submissive look or a concerned look, than a guilty look. I'm not saying that dogs don't feel guilt. They very well might, but this look isn't showing us that.From here:https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561551389/from-fire-hydrants-to-rescue-work-dogs-perceive-the-world-through-smell
You know it's bad when the *cat* is looking guilty.
[deleted]
Did you check the backyard? Sprinklers/new holes in the yard?Be sure to check your bed, as well! And any cables you have! Tv, console, PC
One probably puked and the other ate it. At least that's how it goes at my place.
OMG the way the cat sits! Is it the Japanese way?
You'll probably smell it real soon.  :)
So, what did they break, OP? TELL MEEEEEE! 😯
Cat.
This is kind of like a treasure hunt game! So interesting :)
On behalf of reddit, they're forgiven.
Poor babies! I had a dog that would do that to me quite often when I came home from work. For the longest time I couldn't figure out what she was "guilty" of. I finally figured it out after about two months of her giving me that look.... She was guilty of sleeping on our dirty clothes! I finally convinced her it was okay, but she still had a bit of guilty look sometimes. Sweet hearts.
Cat's don't give a fuck about breaking or damaging human stuff, so if the cat is bashful its something more serious.They've probably been fucking.
They're about to break your karma.
I'd check under the bed first.. mine looooove to bring whatever they destroy under the bed
Your hea- oh thats been taken...Ill just go now...
Does this look like a painting to anyone else?
Perfect title.  Props.
Check their teeth! Who pooed in the house and who ate it? Joking but not joking...
When even the cat is embarrassed, you *know* shit went bad
Lol it looks like the cat is whisper to the dog, "say anything and i'll kill you...."
The dog is definitely in submissive mode and accordingly almost certainly is aware of having done something that has gotten him in trouble in the past.  The cat doesn't give a shit and is there either by happenstance, or because the dog is his particular friend and he's showing affection.
We have the same kitty!!!
Lean on me... when you're not strong.
DID YOU FIND IT? WHAT DID THEY DOOOO?
The cat took a crap and the dog ate it.
How bout the internet?
update?
I think they were making out. And now they are both ashamed about it. What happens in the pantry stays in the pantry!
Aww pawtners in crime
The cat is calmly, rationally explaining the consequences of busting him out to the hoomans, the dog want's to go witness protection, but doesn't know how to get that ball rolling.
The cat can't even bear your gaze. Guilty AF
They conspired and killed the neighbors pets
You know they broke something when the cat is hiding in shame as cats usually don't give a fuck. Source: own a cat and can confirm they don't care about anything except food.Edit: cat probs puked and the dog ate it
99% chance the cat did it.
That's a dog that has eaten cat shit.
They both look like siblings that got in trouble. Details: The cat is the younger sister and the dog is the brother
Yeah, the cat ate everything out of the litter box again.
I recommend you not jump into bed tonight, but approach cautiously
Oh I know that look.  It’s gonna be expensive
Ha ha! That's hilarious.. You will.. ; )
They didn't break anything. They're hiding their forbidden love.
It's been four hours. Have you found it yet?
They broke my heart.
How topical...from next week's *New Yorker*:https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/59fcc974f40de92b73812f44/master/w_964,c_limit/171113_a21400_rd2.jpg
They didn't break but melted my heart after seeing this
The cat be like : "Hey Doggo, could you smirk and repeat “On the advice of counsel I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and respectfully decline to answer your question” ?"
My grandfather was a farmer and my mom said the dog once slunk into the house covered in mud looking totally guilty. Turned out he buried a goose. My grandfather later found a hole in the ground, feathers everywhere, and an extremely muddy goose that apparently managed to unearth itself.
They look so heckin' guilty
They had sex.
They probably pooped and ate it.
He may have tried to hump the cat, she's underage.. Wait a minute is that Hollywood star Air Bud?? What's going on with Hollywood these days?
They surely did something. They are hiding something
Cat: I did itDog: Don't get mad at cat. Maybe I did it?
I used to come home ready because I knew my dog had been bad and been on the couch.  Dog let off a lot of fur and I hated getting it on my clothes.I would run to the couch and see if it was warm and if so I knew my couch had been sat on.  The dog would be disciplined.  (no abuse, don't freak out.  just stern voice and a finger wag)My dog went from being excited to see me come home to not and acting "in trouble" even when it did nothing.  I learned forget the couch.  Instead when I came home I would be excited to see my dog and pet my dog + give them love.TL;DR love your animals.edit: Moby Dick's plot
They didn’t break anything. They licked their butts on your bed!
That's what I look like when I spill the oatmeal on my boss's suit during the morning meeting.
They don't want you to find out about their forbidden love.
It is illegal t have pets that cute
check under the couch
They are guilty about something.  Wonder if you ever found out????
I'm gonna guess they didn't break anything, but instead someone peed or pooped where the shouldn't have.  That's usually how my dogs act after.
GUILTY. AS. FUCK.Source: Have owned both cats and a dog.
This is too cute, I love how the cat is hiding away, I can tell he/she did it lol, it's always the cats
Ha! Adorable! It appears they are very sorry for whatever they did.
This photo made me realize that while they're both almost the same color, we would refer to that cat as orange, but not the dog. I've never heard anyone call a dog orange.
[deleted]
so much shame in one photolove it
Must be REALLY bad if even the cat is showing remorse.
So did you find what they broke OP?
The internet.
I’ve got it. Same as mine. Cat pooped and doggie ate it.
Your dog crapped in the house and your cat accidentally sprinted through it, subsequently painting the walls with it as it continued to get run.
The cat definitely devised the cleanup plan and the dogs conscience is showing.
Cat(in mob-like voice): “Listen here bud, be cute and calm. Cute and calm. Now—
The cat did it.
I’m scared...WHAT DID THEY DO?!?
The may have eaten something.
but look at those puppy eyes.
If you can't find whats wrong, that's because they ate it.
They shit. That's the same face my dog make when it shit somewhere sneaky.
u/tashaaaaaaaaaaaa look at them
Your cat has guilty looks?? My cat is proud and cocky as hell when he breaks shit.
They broke the internet
Ah, but you will!
Bitch, act guilty. I aint do shit, got me?
Oh yeah, that is the [guilty] look.
Let us know when/If you find it!
So sweet (๑･̑◡･̑๑)
It was your heart!
This was the picture taken right before catdog was born
They ate the stash and cat can't stop giggling... Dog's pretty sure they know.
One pooped in the house...the other ate it.  Oh the shame
Cat.
Your ❣ heart
Did you ever find out what they broke?
This is just too cute
Partners in crime!  Adorable!
At least they look guilty? Mine is like, "look what I chewed up! isn't it neat!"
My heart
Those faces. Yes. I know those faces all too well. Good luck, and happy hunting for the mistake.
Best thread of the day.
Where's the poop Robin?
Maybe it's their relationship that they're ashamed of? You'd think that in 2017 a dog and cat could be friends without any social repercussions.
They probably made a catdog.
That’s because they ate it.
Maybe nothing broke, just "seasoned"
My heart ❤
 they are ashamed bc they had some sex while you were gone
so cute
I did, it's my heart
Whatever it is, I doubt you'll be able to get angry at them with that face.
Someone threw up and the other ate it.
[You should be trying to find what broke *them*...](https://i.imgur.com/G3YYImd.jpg)
I don't even care what they broke, they're forgiven. Pardoned by cuteness overload.
Hahaha they really can't hide their guilt.
they broke your mind by tricking you into thinking they broke something
Aww don’t be mad!
Whenever I hear people say that dogs only look guilty as a response to you being mad, I think of situations like this.My dog does this too or more recently, while he won't ever run out the door for a walk when I come home, he will if he's gotten into the garbage or something.  I can't help but think he's trying to distract me or at the very least delay getting mad at him. The point is, both of these are independent of how I actually react and dependent on how he thinks I will react.
Yup, sth's broken, pooped on or eaten.
He looks a lot like my boyfriends dog, Zelda. Golden retriever/chowhttps://imgur.com/gallery/T9g5o
This is how my dog looks, when my cat is in heat and has been following him around all day, rubbing her face on him and putting her butt in his face. He looks at me like 😕 "help"
r/AccidentalRenaissance
They ate it
100% the Cat's fault. Look at him, zero remorse.
I have two cats and a dog, when they do this I assume one pooped and the other ate it.
So...? What did they do? I saw this yesterday, and came back to check. Still no answer!
They didn't break anything somebody pooped....or tore the stuffing out of something.
The dog pooped in the litter box and the cat peed in the sock drawer. That or the cat pooped under the table and the dog ate it.
You know one of your dogs is a cat right?
Cat's don't give a fuck.
DEVAUGHN: Yo what did you find it.
awww
haha... no kidding.
Broke the upvote sound barrier
It's the cat who broke it and he is just blackmailing the dog to take responsibility or cat will kill him on his sleep.Cats are always up on bookshelves and pushes things off of it.
the cat is kneeling like it was just praying
Or what they ate, or accidentally killed, or where they pooped? Mind you they're both in on in that's for sure!
Did you now?!
tshirt or postcard adorable for sure.   Also would put on my fridge along with other precious items
Guilty AF
Looks like puppers is keeping kitty’s secret
My dog is acting the same right now... Still havent found anything.
I bet it’s a turd somewhere.
Is she looking?
Your cat has a seriously fluffy belleh
Keep us updated!
Pretty sure this one is food related.
I play this grame with my cat, but it's called "i haven't found where he vomited yet."
Cat.
Look for that missing shoe.
maybe the dog tried playing with the cat and got slapped
Cant tell if Cat is remorseful or scheming...
The dog's collar looks like a low-res texture at least in the picture I'm seeing wtf
Dog took a dump in your closet, cat helped him hide it.
For a cat to feel guilt, it probably murdered your child.
Experience with my teenagers says your cat got something on her face pierced... If nothing's obvious check the tongues.
Somebody pooped somewhere.
I took a big sigh when I saw this.😂 the stress level goes from 1 to 50 in a heartbeat😂😂
Guilty written all over that face. LOL. But way too cute to yell at.
:D
The cat is pregnant
I want to hug your animals.  badly.
The cat hid it.
What's kind is he?
I wanna go with the cat pooped in a shoe and the dog ate it.
Ah, the "Where's the poop?!" game. My least favorite!
Hopefully it's not water that broke
Smell the carpet yet?
you'll find it eventually. they definitely broke something.
Dogs looking at you thinking, whys this thing head bonking meeee?
I take the blame for whatever they did!!!
Dog broke it, cat hid it. May as well buy a new one of whatever they broke.
They share a love that cannot be spoken ! 😍
It might’ve been your back, be careful OP.
Hahaha
Look for the damp spot.
Oh my...this looks serious
What cuties!!
Is that cat in a seiza?
Don't be surprised when you start having cat-dogs
Maybe they didn’t break anything. Maybe they poop under the dining table. Lol
I'm sure the cat doesn't give a fuck
The cat is toughing the dog's heart
Is your litter box clean? Did you or your SO clean it?
The look latinamerican teens give their moms after having sex or drinking alcohol
More like, where they dropped that fat deuce.Follow the smell
let's get started
I mean we all know that face is cos the cat is rubbing himself against the dog, you see it on its hind legs. But anyway. Enjoy.
Cute dog and cat relationship hahaha
Why does it look kind of like a painting? Is it the light reflecting on the dog and the kind of detailless color/fur? I can't put my finger on it.
What did they break? This must be answered.
Where's the poop?
Maybe they went number 1 somewhere... My dog does the same when she pee or breaks anything
/r/GuiltyDogs
At my house when the pets are naughty, one dog hides, the other is sorry-not-sorry, while the cat sits there looking smug.
Check the rubbish bin
https://condenaststore.com/featured/listen-thats-a-tang-dynasty-urn-we-just-broke-harry-bliss.html
Lol that's the definite look of I just s,hat on your pillow.
Good pets. Who's a good pet?Wait, where is my sub?
I love how the cars on his knees.
They doggone did something pawful fur sure, cats off to them if you don't find out though.
Too sweet
Maybe this is DST-syndrome?  "Oh god it was dinner time an hour ago and he hasn't fed us yet!  Does he hate us?  Did we make him mad? :(  "
Time to dig through some poop.
you can't find it because they ATE IT!!!
I'm betting the cat vomited in a shoe. The dog thinks he will get blamed.
Not broke, ate.
OP update plz?
Bribe em
The most beautiful thing I saw today
Awwww..Probably the cookie jar
This is my kryptonite.
OMG I can't stand it
what an awesome duo!
That's a distraction, look behind you..
Check the bottom of your shoes
What beautiful animals
I bet it was the cat idea.
The probably pooped in your computer
The way the kitty is sitting os freaking me out
Nice.......when I was a kid, I was playing badminton with my mom and dog jumped on her and broke her leg...he looked just like this after.
I take the blame OP!!! You have to forgive them!!!
Come on, OP, don't leave us hangin'!
This is love and shame. Cat pooped on the floor, dog ate it to hide the evidence.
Well have you found out about it yet
We might all be looking at the issue from the wrong point of view 🙄
This is super cute. Hahaha
They either broke something or pissed somewhere in the house
Is this a painting?
LOL, I have the same breed of dog. They are so cute!
Each others hearts they are working on it leave em alone.
The cat did it.
These eyes... are cryin'...
Living parallel lives: red lab & orange tabby, except mine being gingers, have no remorse.
I really love your floors. Are they real wood?
 That look of guilt is impressive 😁
Your heart
If the cat's ears were down, that would mean double the damage.  :D
Hide the evidence!
but boy when i do... these guys are in trou-ble!
“Is he looking?”
Where they looking in a certain direction?
It’s my heart
they fucked
Ooh.... but when you DO...it's gonna be a doozy.
My cats would never show this much remorse * *sigh* *
They could have pooped in the kitchen.  Have you checked?  My dogs used to shit in the center of the kitchen for everyone to see.....
It's probably a secret dump they took somewhere in the house.
did u find out?
i found what they broke...my heart...
Why do your animals match and why don’t mine?
OP ? Update plz
They probably got drunk and were making out on your bed.
:))) Priceless
Probably celibacy.
Just spank them now and figure it out later.
they pee'd on the carpet.
Already got one.
That means they ate something :)
Well, whatever they broke...at least they’re sorry about it...
That’s hilarious!
It was the cat wasn't? I have never seen a cat show any shame before, something seems fishy
I know that look, the dog pooped in a high heel shoe in the closet. You will find it traumatically in 6 months, and then scream/cry why god why? Much like Nancy Kerrigan, over and over.
The cat organized this, telling dog to act guilty, and cover his head laughing. Nothing has been done, but OP is having a lot of trouble looking for it. Better prank than breaking material stuff.
Those are two of the guiltiest looking animals ever!
It doesn't matter. All is forgiven. Look at those eyes.
Or it could be a bag of trash all over the bathroom
Um. Their cuteness broke MY HEART.
Plot twist: your dog knocked up your cat, and the pussy is ashamed.
Quick get the Bronco!
You forgive him right now without knowing what it is!
look like, so lovely
Your heart
Check your reuben supply. I bet there's one missing.
They? Nah. Was the cat. Goodboys don't break things.
Or ate😂😂😂
My heart?
My dog looks like this when our cat rubs on her. Actually looks like she is being harassed and needs assistance.
AT THE BATHROOM!!
Your trust
My heart.
But, how can you be mad at such a face?
We want an update!! what did they break!
Yeah. My heart
Your heart :'(
A friendly friend
Yes! My 8 year old staffy mix does this. Sometimes I’ll look for a good five minutes and find nothing, but know I have to punish her because she gave herself up. Sweetest girl, but not the brightest.
The cat pissed on the carpet, the dog thinks you will blame him.
It wasnt photoshop.
Haha my dog does this all the time
Your heart
The dog looks like a cardboard cutout
They’re giving you that “We might have fucked...😬” look.
It doesn't matter, just wuv on them. :(
That look is universal
(Oliver Twist voice) Please sir, “more forgiveness”
You gonna be pissed
Nah, that’s a hidden turd look
I miss these moments so much. We just put down our dog of 6yrs a couple days ago. Is there a sub for dog loss support?
loool
How come my wild hyena of a dog never acts remorseful when he rips my stuff up.
Automatically forgiven for being cute
oh nooooooo
They have such amazing coats. Forgive them because they're fabulous..
They had sex.
You will. Those are the two guiltiest fluffers I’ve ever seen lol
Our hearts. They broke our hearts.
So cuute!
This is making me so happy
The dog looks a bit like Dobby.
Your heart.
My heart with tbose adorable looks
Its gonna be bad dude even the cats sorry and cats are never sorry
They just escaped Kevin Spacey's basement.
Doggo is deserving an beat.
Is that a golden retriever/lab mix???
Dog taking advice from cat? Ha ha ha.LOL
At least they stick together.
I️ think it might have been your face
Pretty sure whatever they broke, the cat was the mastermind behind it. And probably whispering in the dog's ear: "If you rat me out, you better sleep with one eye open tonight"
Awwwww the kitty
They look guilty enough to have been the sole culprits behind Chernobyl, 911, and WW1, plus WW2. Poor kids. Forgive their world ending shenanigans before treat time.
Looks like my doggies
Their hearts 😢
Ultimate guilt.
They are so obviously guilty, oh my.
He is focused to the camera while she is shy.
"Ok, it's raining. Who shit  behind the couch?"
This looks like a painting
SHAME😂😂😂😂😂
Dogs show remorse, cats are just like "it was in my way".
That's some mungojerry and rumpleteaser shit right there!
Im getting a puppy tomorrow after having a pup for 12 years.  I am not looking forward to this look.
Yeah, yeah, aww cute pets....WHO THEY HELL INSTALLED THAT SHOE MOLD UPSIDE DOWN???Edit...Apparently I wrote my my comment upside down. Leaving now...
Guilty as hay-al
The floor
or where they laid a shit
"ask for trial by combat"
That's because they ate it too.
Hahahhaha oh my god those guilty faces and so familiar. You must have a mess somewhere!
They way Eddie Murphy's dog looked at his dad
/u/vinlandpeasant
Each other's heart 💔
It’s like the cat is confessing to its sins
Classic Cat Dog Romance Shame right there.
high profilin, strofilin
Mixture of many emotions on face makes me confused about what would this dog be thinking
so cuteeee
The "Usual" suspects.
It's like Adam and Eve in the Garden: "Who told you you were naked?"
I seen that look before. I am afraid they did something more shameful; cross species sort of way
Cat.
Looks like they kissed each other ...
