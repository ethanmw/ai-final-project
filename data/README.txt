scrape_reddit.py until 12/8 was not working as intended in regard to adding a comment multiple times to the corpus based on its score. As a result all data gathered previous to 12/8 only added comments once regardless of its score. All data that was gathered while scrape_reddit.py was not working as intended has been moved to /unweighted_comments. All new data gathered using scrape_reddit.py will be automatically saved to /weighted_comments.
