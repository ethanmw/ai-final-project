You give the frog water to drink. Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives.,15929,aww
When life hands you a tiny swimming pool....,508,aww
Just have to say that anyone who would notice a random tree frog on a hot day, then go get him a drink, is destined to make the world a better place. Keep up the good work.,19563,aww
Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.,225,aww
That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!,576,aww
He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.,197,aww
It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you.,195,aww
If I fits, I sits,1624,aww
What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?,289,aww
Love this post 🙂,258,aww
Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off.,116,aww
My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I’m there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot.,206,aww
Now he won’t croak!,758,aww
You are a very good human OP!!,141,aww
I love you OP. ♥️ You just gave that frog the best day of his little life.,69,aww
Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"😁,335,aww
You rule,59,aww
Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond?  Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.,948,aww
The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.,542,aww
*wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...,49,aww
Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clip,94,aww
This leapt into my heart!,30,aww
I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy.,29,aww
Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.,63,aww
DID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY’S THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little.,19,aww
I love frogs. They’re so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep.,36,aww
People like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ❤ we all can learn from that!,66,aww

He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him 😊,13,aww
You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.,30,aww
In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.,12,aww
Good on you. But just for reference frogs don’t regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn’t effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel.,23,aww
I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them,26,aww
What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!,27,aww
Tiniest wading pool.,12,aww

I love frogs so small that their swimming pool is a bottle cap. So cute.,8,aww
If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?,8,aww
This is so wholesome.,15,aww
You’re a damn saint.,8,aww
Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE,8,aww
It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.,7,aww
 congrats on making it to the top posts of all time,7,aww
So since we’re talking about caring for small animals here I thought I’d bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I’ve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I’m getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over “NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!” They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there’s no animal. It’s just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn’t amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. Welp that’s it,18,aww
Kind of amazing,11,aww
Stupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!,4,aww
I love how he shuffled all the way to the front so it looked like he was resting his chin on the finger :’),6,aww
Doing God’s work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you,6,aww
Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin.,6,aww
That wiggle😍,5,aww
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?,6,aww
He *is* drinking while soaking! That’s how frogs do it! You’re a good hooman!,10,aww

He just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OP,5,aww
I love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, “Ugh, don’t fuck with me, it’s too hot.” Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren’t going to kill him.,5,aww
Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!,5,aww
/r/HumansBeingBros,4,aww
That frog looked at the camera/human and was like “are you serious? For me? Okay, don’t mind if I do!”,6,aww
My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.Nope.This gets my upvote nonetheless.,5,aww
Quick, sign a contract with him!Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot,5,aww
You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh.,5,aww
You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp,5,aww
 Frogs don’t physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.,5,aww
He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond.,4,aww
You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all time,5,aww

As soon as he realized it was water, his need for moisture overcame his fear of humans. Such a sweet thing to see. Thank you for being such a kind person and even noticing the plight of such a little creature.,5,aww
Frogs don’t “drink”, they absorb water through their skin!,3,aww
amphibians absorb water through their skin so this was the same thing as a drink to him.,4,aww
This is so fucking cute I actually gasped and made a weird squealing noise... he’s so happy in his tiny little pool 😭😭😭,4,aww
Frogs can drink though their skin,3,aww
You're a good person OP. Keep being a bro to all beings big and small,6,aww

Fun fact: Frogs and toads don’t drink water they absorb it through their skin,4,aww

Hopefully that water wasn't chlorinated,3,aww
Man, top post of all time!,3,aww
Technically, he took you up on the offer. Amphibians absorb moisture the their skin instead of physically drinking water. His little scoot in the cap was him maximizing his surface area inside the water. Good job caring for the little guy!,4,aww

We've been getting a huge heat wave here too, +30's and above, which is crazy hot for where I live.  I never even thought of this but I should probably put large water bowls outside for various animals that may be desperate for water or a place to cool off.,3,aww
Thank you for helping Frogger 🙂 This video is adorable.,3,aww
I love how it starts off suspicious, then realizes that there's a nice little pool of water.,3,aww
I don’t know why but all frogs have an Australian accent in my mind.,3,aww
Any way this was in Texas? Because we were melting today.,3,aww
I mean look at the size of the container you offered him! He obviously thought you were offering a bath.If someone pushed a bathtub full of water towards you would you think... oh, a drink?,3,aww

So wholesome. I love the way it looks at you like, "what? Really? That's mine? Nice....ahhhhhhhh, refreshing.",3,aww
Should make a little rock pool in your garden area without pets. If you have frogs its a good sign that you probably have alot of creepy crawlies around that probably need water too. Pot bases are great with a few rocks in them and some fresh water. We do it for all our wildlife in summer! big and small!And i dont like frogs at all! But in the heat im happy to help anything in need!!!,3,aww
Holy crap, this is currently the second highest voted post on r/aww of all time!,3,aww
Frogs “drink” through their skin btw. So technically he’s drinking and bathing :D,3,aww
Many types of frogs drink through their skin and not their mouth as one would think. That is probably why he/she went into the water, to get a drink. Google it. Still extremely adorable. Great post.,3,aww
Boopity Boop, Bappity Bap, There's a Tree frog in my Bottle Cap. 💓,3,aww
The heat here has been really intense as well and the poor jackdaws and crows are all panting and look miserable. We saw some grouped around a small, shallow puddle in the road, taking quick sips, so we bought some water on our ice cream run and poured it into their puddle for them.,3,aww
Wow this became the top post of all time in just 9 hours!,3,aww
This is very adorable. I truly do love frogs, they’re just so cute. However, I absolutely would have screamed, dropped the cap, and retreated quickly at the moment he looks up. They’re so unpredictable and that’s the one thing that terrifies me about frogs. Face leaping little shits.,3,aww
Don’t amphibians “drink” through their skin though? Correct me if I’m wrong. Little dude very well may be getting a drink after all.,3,aww
I wish I had the video still, but I ran into a similar situation in Queensland. This guy was just parked on the bench in like 34 degree heat, tilting his head towards the shower.https://imgur.com/xvJRySB,3,aww
Interesting. A frog named Heat Index.,3,aww
He was having a drink, frogs absorb water through their skin!,3,aww

imagine getting one of the most upvoted posts in just a day. wow props to you OP.,3,aww
Your cute science PSA: Frogs do not drink from their mouths like you do. Most absorb water and gasses directly through a thin layer of skin on their belly and pelvic region called the ‘drink patch.’ (I know because I'm a frog scientist),3,aww
How does it feel to have a Top 8 of all time post after only a day?,3,aww
You should that that frog don't drink water like we do ( using mouth) , they absorb water by their skin using  gland called "drinking patch"...So ,in a reality he only accepted your cold drink respectfully,3,aww
I understand. My wife and I often go far out of our way to help frogs, toads, and turtles. Won't anyone else think of them?,3,aww

Wuss Poppin here for the comment,3,aww
Frogs absorb moisture through their skin rather than drinking it(as do a lot of other amphibians), so it was always going to be both a soak and a drink.,3,aww
I'm gonna guess that frogs and most other amphibians absorb a lot of water through their skin.,3,aww
“Could you take me to the nearest pond please?”,3,aww

Funny story. Once when I was young a tree frog fell in the boat with me and my dad and he handed it to me. When I was done with it I threw it in the water and he was like “what the hell why would you do that?” I said “he’s a frog” he said “a TREE frog. Not a WATER frog” and I cried cause I thought I drowned a frog.,2,aww
He’s probably drinking through the “drinking patch” located on the belly and and underside of their thighs. I learned this from Tuck Everlasting,2,aww
Frogs drink thru their skin... ❤️🐸,2,aww

There's something special about the combination of a kind human and an appreciative frog. Didn't know that until now. But definitely special.,2,aww
So cute! You should put a small dish of water or something out there for him.,2,aww
What a cutie,2,aww
Damn, you’re a real homie!,2,aww
He’s totally smiling at the end <3,2,aww
I didn't know I needed a frog in my life.,2,aww
Frogs actually drink by absorbing water through their skin so he did, in fact, take up your offer.,2,aww
From a frog lover, thank you for this,2,aww
Don't worry, Froggy. I'll keep you moist.,2,aww
How did you not keep him??? Omg soo cute,2,aww
Well this just brightened up my day!,2,aww
Poor guy,2,aww

This is a lot more polite than the time I caught a lethargic amphibian in the basement, took it outside while half asleep myself, and put it a little too enthusiastically in the nearby small pond. Tried to help, ended up water boarding. :(,2,aww
Thank you for taking care for that little frog.,2,aww
"Mjeh",2,aww
That often *is* how many reptiles drink, especially desert reptiles. Water on their body will be drawn to the edges of their mouth via the capillary effect.Think of if you put a paper towel upright in a glass of water. The water will travel up the towel, wetting the portion not in the glass.This be how some frogs and lizards do.,2,aww
Definitely gonna need more frogs on this sub,2,aww
Thank u/footloosepicklejuice friend of frogs,2,aww

A lot of people say humans as a species should die out, as we are killers and haters, but I disagree.  This video shows what we are; the love we have inside us for everything around us.  If there is even just one person with compassion and the want to help others we have hope and we should survive.,2,aww

The wife hangs these flower baskets on the outside lights at our house every summer. One year, while watering it, I see movement inside, and it turns out a frog decided to make it his/her home. So i cut out the bottom of a cup and filled it with water and placed it nicely inside. The next day, I come out to check on em, and low and behold, he is passed out inside the cup in the water. He stayed around for a good 3 or 4 months before he/she decided to move on.,2,aww
The way they just shuffled down in the cap a little deeper than when they first got in and just started relaxing was just adorable.,2,aww
This is the most upvoted thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit, great job!!,2,aww

Frogs do not drink like we do; they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. Ps I’m not smart I googled it,2,aww
I think you may have found a froggo doggo.,2,aww
This has got to be like 100 times worse than when a cat sits on your lap and you're not allowed to move anymore,2,aww

Omg first time ive seen a frog do that so calmly and knowingly. It KNEW you were offering to help it, looked straight up at you and took a chance. This is honestly amazing. And good on you for taking the time out of your day to offer aid to a small critter, clearly it appreciated it. Aaaa this is just so adorable and amazing and ahdjfjkf always makes me wonder what is going through some animals’ heads, like especially for such a tiny frog which are normally skittish.Speaking of frogs, this just made me think of my own [frog story](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/90cn2u/full_story_in_comments_a_very_cold_tree_frog_i/?st=JJTG05I7&sh=e36dedee),1,aww

My niece has discovered a few little tiny skinks living around a rock wall in her backyard.  She's upset that it is so hot outside so I promised her I'd help her make them a little minipond this weekend so they can "Netflix and chill" (her words...yes we are positive that she has no idea what this means and is just repeating things she's heard on TV.  Yes we lol about this).  So what do?  I was thinking of using this old white dogfood dish the previous tennants left in the garage.  Throw a few rocks in there, fill with water and tuck it into a shady corner of the wall.  Will that be beneficial?  Will they even care?,1,aww

Amphibians, in particular frogs, absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The drinking patch is located under their belly and thighs, which explain the “full body soak” in the gif.,1,aww

I found an injured, and probably dying crow on my front steps on July 4th. I knew there was nothing I could do to help the poor fella, so I let him be on the front steps (the alternative would have probably been to forcefully get him off the stairs). I also gave him a bowl of water. That crow might not have been able to get off the step, but he sure enjoyed crawling into the water. The next morning he was gone. In my mind's narrative, he got better and flew away. In reality, he probably died during the night and got carried away by a raccoon or cat or something.,1,aww

My mom's boss was going through some personal problems and had to get rid of his dog. My mom said she would baby sit till he got everything in order. Mom had a car accident not long after and could not work anymore. Her boss moved to another state to take care of one of his kids. 5 years goes by and he comes into town for court with his ex wife. His dog went ape shit when she heard his voice. Dog was crying tears, barking like crazy, and running in circles around him.    We ended up baby sitting the dog for 12 years. She died at 18, but any time he came over, you could tell she was always his dog.,1603,aww

my girlfriend found a dog awhile back and tried to find an owner but no one called back to the signs. she didn't check for a chip because he was pretty haggard looking and she didn't have time to take him to the vet. fast forward to a few months later and she takes him into the vet for a check up and just as a joke checks for a chip and what do you know, he has one. perks up to his old name and she took him to his owner that night, her family was ecstatic and thought he was long gone. i miss that little dog but i am glad he's back with his original family.,2493,aww
TF did the thieves think was gonna happen once they had to bring the dog in?Edit: Apparently they didn't steal it; they bought it in front of a mall. In any case, they shouldn't have tried to keep it once they found out it had a proper owner.,3862,aww
[deleted],1681,aww
[deleted],24954,aww
They should have had a neutral person bring the dog in, and have each person just stand there and then see. Edit: Oh wow this was after 2 years. Definitely his dogEdit2: Just saw the video of the case and it was actually just 5 months. By the time they got on the show it was 6 or 7 months total,2461,aww
> He does that to everybodyFuck off!,889,aww
[Here's the video](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/videos/man-claims-that-woman-has-his-lost-dog/82499782/),832,aww
I love this! You can tell his owner really loved and took care of him the way the dog ran to him.,249,aww
Judge Judy is a pretty cool dude.,590,aww
I'm over here nearly crying over a Judge Judy clip. Damn.,398,aww
And the wise judge spoke 'Cut the dog in half',207,aww
It's a good thing my dog is registered to me and I have proof that he's been mine since he was 8 weeks old.Because *he* really does do this with everybody.,145,aww
Open and shut case, justice served!,227,aww
L A W Y E R B O Y E,92,aww
If there's any question why Judge Judy makes so much money - she's the shit,117,aww
I will John Wick any fucker who tries to steal my dog,61,aww
You can tell it's the *smell* that gets the recognition.,22,aww
It's always incredibly sweet to see a big man loving his tiny prissy pup.,21,aww
"He does that to everybody." Oh shut up.,79,aww
how in the hell does judge judy look the same as she did 20 years ago!?,18,aww
Never thought I'd see r/aww mixed withr/justiceserved,18,aww

Someone tried to steal my puppy at the airport when I was 3 right before Christmas. The airport said he had arrived but he was missing and now they couldn't find him. He was only a few months old and a dalmatian in peak 101 dalmatian times so my dad suspected something was up. He wanted them to look harder, so he told ME, the exhausted 3 year old missing her dog, that someone had lost my puppy...right in front of customer service to intentionally make a scene.Anyway, he mysteriously turned up not long after I started screaming. He was found in a room he shouldn't have been in, back in a maze of offices. My parents swear someone was trying to take him for a Christmas present, but it ended with a happy reunion and 12 more years of walks <3,14,aww
This is too pure for reddit,12,aww

Yeah, when you start crying from holding a dog, it's your fuckin dog.,25,aww
I remember an old man tried to steal our dog, despite him being collared. Luckily we were able to convince the man to give him back without getting the authorities involved.People who steal dogs are sick.,11,aww
Congrats, you just made a 6'8" tall man cry happy tears.,10,aww
Case solved, love that judge.,29,aww
I love how sick of this shit Judy is."It's his dog. That's all, take the dog home",18,aww
Judge Judy is a G... My girlfriend bartends a few daytime shifts a week and always has Judy playing in the background. She's a mega fan. She even dressed up as her for Halloween. I wrote the production company and sent her a pic of my girlfriend in costume and she sent me back an autographed headshot written specifically to my gf. Gf cried. Judge Judy got me some serious cred. JUDY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.,9,aww
"Court room"..."Judge Judy"Not what I was expecting.,9,aww
Realistically the only fair way to settle such a dispute is by cutting the dog in half and letting them both have a piece.,8,aww
Here, it was obvious to everyone the dog was his, but Judge Judy really does have an awesome BS detector. I both fear and love that woman.,16,aww

Woman in court as dense as a logHer behavior likened to a hogShe tries to be coyand hide a good boyCause she purchased a stolen dog,138,aww
Air bud irl.,6,aww
I want to be clear that she didn't say "Would you pick him up." She said, "You can pick him up." She knows how much this dog loves him and how much he loves that dog. There was no hesitation of a doubt and I find that beautiful. And kudos for the guy for having restraint to not just lose it right there,6,aww
Feels like this could also go well in /r/justiceporn.,6,aww
"Court room",5,aww
"Listen to me carefully. Cut the dog in half.""Mmhmm. We both get part that way.""WHAT!? NO!! NOT FLUFFLES! Let her have him. As long as he's alive and happy.""It's his dog.""Oh he says that to everybody.""It's his dog.",16,aww
I'm unreasonably angry after "he does that to everybody"And I'm like... biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii,16,aww
I'm not crying, *you're* crying.,21,aww
Background info:The lady had purchased the dog for $50 6 months ago with little suspicion as the "owner" wanted to get rid of it cause it was incompatible with their other dog.The actual owner found out about it 3 months later and request the return.The conflict comes from when the woman didn't believe (or didn't want to believe) that this was not her dog.TL:DR neither person was at fault and the real asshole was the one who stole the dog to sell for a quick buck causing both sides to feel emotional turmoil... supposedly.,30,aww
I wish Judge Judy would run for president. I trust her.,34,aww
"No your honor, you don't understand. This dog is a total slut! They'll accept pettings from anyone!",4,aww
And then you remember judge judy is fake af anyway,4,aww
This is why you microchip your pets.,4,aww
Lawyer- "do you see the defendant in the courtroom today?"Dog- *wags tail*,5,aww
Your honor, I'd like to request a 20-minute recess for tummy rubs and scritches.,4,aww
Judge Judy, for all the pageantry, is a badass. Good on her.,4,aww
here's the episodehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0a6Oy7rfAand here's the commentary he said/she said at the endhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g&t=1m49s,5,aww
Sad story:When I was 9, my dog was stolen from my garage, a small terrier.Six months later, he was at my doorstep waiting for me.I was overjoyed. He was filthy, washed him, cut his hair, combed him all night and when I woke up, the side door was broken down again into the garage.My dog was stolen again.,6,aww
This made me cry! Good call, Judge Judy. <3,9,aww
Amazing that the Judge Judy serious stare directly translates to: youfuckingassholebitchareyououtofyourgoddamnedmindbringingthisfuckingbullshitgarbageinmyfuckingcourtoflaw Language fascinates me,9,aww
"it's his dog." case dismissed immediately! LOL,10,aww
That was so satisfying to watch. Judge Judy is the bomb.,7,aww
"He does that to everybody."Lol! Funny, he didn't do that to every other person in the court room.,8,aww
Take my children, fine. Take my dog, I'll kill myself,7,aww
What did we do to deserve dogs?,7,aww
You can't say dogs do that to everyone. Kidding me? That was a reaction of a dog seeing someone he knew and loves.,9,aww
"He does that to everyone." Not exactly,3,aww
I think that's the brother or some other close relative of my parents' moving guy. I had just taken the bar exam that morning and he told me about him appearing on that show to recover a stolen dog. Neat to see the video!,4,aww
Lol it's kind of funny that a big black dude has a tiny little dog lol.,3,aww
This is my biggest fear. I adopted my dog two years ago from the Humane Society and I am terrified one day we're going to be walking down the street and he's going to lose his shit seeing someone.,3,aww
BRING OUT THE DANCING LOBSTERS!,5,aww
Her face always screams "I'm sick of this shit.",5,aww
https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g Here's the full case for anyone interested.,5,aww
Case dismissed, bring in the dancing lobsters!,4,aww
Bichons are the most loving breed. They get attached to a person very easily. He may have liked the lady, but it would have never been the same as his daddy.,4,aww
My puppy greets me like this everyday, and only follows me.  Dogs know their true friends.,4,aww
"That's him! He's the one who said I was best doggo!",4,aww
That woman felt the full force of the paw.,4,aww
I just watched this episode this morning. Basically the Plaintiff (the guy who owns the dog) is suing the Defendant for stealing the dog, when the defendant claims she bought it for $50. So this happens.Wholesome case altogether,4,aww
source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6gYeah that dog reacted that way after like 8 months away and you can hear the mom saying "don't. don't. don't." as she's putting the dog down.  They knew damn well that was his dog.   The mom tried to say she recently bought the dog, bs.,4,aww
Yaaaaaas I love judge Judy. Also the moment when the dog and his owner make eye contact 😭,4,aww
I gotta say, despite the fact that reality shows are scripted, and hers probably just as much, I think Judy Scheindlin is one of the best celebrities out there.She actually practiced law, she doesn't take bull (how she acts in the show is how she acts in real life, though maybe toned down a bit) and the show is meant to get people to do the right thing. She's someone people can actually look up to,2,aww
Christ, I didn't see the k on the votes. I was wondering why a post with only 119 upvotes was on the front page XD,5,aww
I love it when dogs are that happy. It's like they can't handle what it does to their body,5,aww
[Judge Judy Dog](https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g) Kind of interesting to watch with sound and see what happens afterwards . I love the, "Thank you Judge Judy! You're not so mean after all" lol,4,aww
"Court room",5,aww
When I was younger, my cat went missing. I was pretty upset and searched/put out signs but didn't find her. A few years later, my vet called - a lady brought in a cat she found as a stray (a few towns over) and my vet recognized my cat. The lady told me all about the adventures they had while waiting to find her "mom" and was happy to return her to me. I offered to work to pay her back the vet bills she had but she said no, it was enough that she found the owners and got to return her. I always thought that was the sweetest thing a person could do for a young kid. I was so happy to have my cat back. :),5,aww
I had one of my dogs stolen out of our front yard. Apparently this 20 something dumbass and his girlfriend decided to pick him up and tried to give it to his dad as a present. Thankfully, his dad was sensible and called the number on his collar to return the him. Not the first time either. A few years ago, someone stole my puppy out of our front yard too. People suck.,3,aww
I went on a week long backpacking trip and they only thing I could think about was getting back to my dog. I had not even a foot in the door when my sweet boy ran over and jumped in my arms freaking out and super happy to see me. I was crying so hard because I was happy to see him. I really relate to this guy crying at holding his dog again.,4,aww
This almost made me cry, i haven't cried since my little han got murdered .,5,aww
"He does that to everybody" what a pathetic excuse 😂😂,7,aww
Every morning Trump wants a binder full of things people like about him.Every morning I'd like a binder full of gifs like this, where good shit's happening to folks all over the daggun place.,7,aww
I own this breed of dog. There's no way that dude isn't the dogs owner. These dogs are sweet and friendly, but they only act like that with 'their' person. My own husband doesn't get that kind of love from my dog. Even if she hadn't seen him in a really long time. These dogs are perfectly nice and love people, they'll let anyone pet them. (Even my girl who is scared of everything.) But this amount of excitement is reserved for that one person that they've adopted.,6,aww
"He does that to everybody"He's not doing it to you, is he?,5,aww
This is beautiful.,3,aww
Judge Judy is awful but was right here.,3,aww
The guy had snausages in his pocket.,3,aww

This is very very sweet. My parents shitzu does the same thing to me. Numerous times my stepmom has brought her in a room full of people and she runs up to me. I was probably her owner in a previous life.,3,aww
If the dog throws a fit, the judge can quit,3,aww
How do we know he doesn't just want the cookie in that guy's pocket?,3,aww

Fuck, I miss my dog.,3,aww
That made my heart sing.,3,aww

Judge Judy deserves every penny of 95$ million contract.,3,aww
I FUCKING LOVE JUDGE JUDY. FOR REAL THO,3,aww
Thank you. This just made my day.,3,aww
That's some Solomon level judging shit.,3,aww

That lying broad should be put in jail. "He does that to everybody" my ass.,3,aww
Ugh why am i crying,3,aww
Damn, I was just watching the video on youtube. A pet knows when they're with their owner- you can't fake that bond.,3,aww
[Here's the clip from the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g)...with sound and post-interviews.,3,aww
If someone tried to steal my dog they wouldn't have made it to Judge Judy.,3,aww
I feel like you just inherently *know* thats his dog, even just watching without sound. Its a gut feeling,3,aww

I wonder what that case was about?,3,aww
Judge Judy's one weak spot is dogs lol. But she also has a keen eye for dogs. Some may be fooled, but Judge Judy isn't. She's a smart cookie!,3,aww
I love that the judge bases who should get the pet based on how the pet is happy to see the owner, this is totally how it should always happen.  Seen a few other instances of this before too (think it was also Judge Judy). I guess that would work ok for dogs, but not cats, because cats DGAF. lol.,3,aww
Best thing I've seen all day,3,aww
"He does that to everybody"The dog hadn't ran to the audience members, though...,3,aww
If someone was selling a dog outside of a mall for $40 I'd find that sketchy as hell. She should have known better.,3,aww
I had to leave my doggo with family when I moved abroad. But every time I come to visit he ignores everyone else and zeroes in on me. Doggo doesn't forget, doggo loves forever.,3,aww

Some months ago I saw what she earns per year. I figured it would be like $5 or 10 million a year, but she gets [$47 million a season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Sheindlin). Not only that, she is the highest paid tv personality.,3,aww

LOYALTY 💓,3,aww
My mom eats this shit up. This one and the slightly younger, less mean female judge show. I don't get it. She's smarter than this.,3,aww
Watched that on judge Judy YouTube yesterday . You can hear the defendant when jj says put the dog down telling her don’t,3,aww
This is a straight up Pixar movie.,3,aww
"He does that to everyone."Give me a break.Anyone that owns a dog knows the difference between a Good Boy greeting their owner, and a Good Boy playing with/asking for scratches from a random person, even if it's the most social Good Boy in the world. The tail wag is completely different. The whine is sadder (like they haven't seen you in a century, even though you just went to the cornerstore to get a carton of milk). They're way more jittery (like they snorted a line of coke). etc.That dude definitely owns that dog. 100%.,3,aww
Cotdam! I just woke up, you can't make me cry like that already,3,aww
I fucking love Judge Judy 😂,3,aww
One of the greatest things I have ever seen on the internet.,3,aww

Case dismissed. Bring in the dancin lobstas,5,aww
Isn't this shit fake?,6,aww
Yes, some dogs act excited around strangers.No dog, ever in the history of dogs has ever acted that way towards someone they didn't intimately know. As-in: A member of their pack.Dogs olfactory systems are the largest and most complex databases in nature. They can remember a person's scent decades after having seen them last. It is how they are able to find their way back to original homesteads after not being there for years. (They often do this when they sense they are dying.)Those women are thieving liars, and I hope they get eaten by bears.,5,aww
"He does that to everybody" yeah, my ass.,5,aww
I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that my dog gets ridiculously overexcited when friends and relatives visit, but is pretty chill greeting me when she doesn't see me for a few days. I'm old news.,8,aww
Totally cried.,5,aww
Is Judge Judy even real? I thought everything except sports (and even sometimes sports) are scripted.This is like Air Bud irl or something.,5,aww
In the YouTube video you can hear the lady saying "don't, don't, don't" when judge Judy asks to put the dog down. What a scumbag.,4,aww
That lady thief is poison.   A real piece of sh*t to stand in a court of law and lie like it was breathing.  Either mentally ill or just poison.  Do they fine the looser or put them in prison ?,4,aww
yeah that is not a court room,5,aww
Is this fake? A setup for the show? Or it really happened?Edit: Seriously, I am not familiar with this kind of show, and curiously asked a question. Was that offensive or so dumb that deserves downvotes?,5,aww
Just like the script writers wrote it!,16,aww
"lost",2,aww
The two women need to be slapped repeatedly for being so ignorant.,2,aww
That's great the dog was returned safe!,2,aww
This is the first time I have completely agreed w Judge Judy 100% and would of done exactly the same thing. Watch the YouTube link above to get more of the picture.,2,aww
Judge Judy rocks!!!,2,aww
Oh judge Judy. This must be the best episode of that entire show.Her net worth is over $300 MILLION.,2,aww
If you want a dog there are so many who need a loving home. People who steal dogs are assholes. I know my dog and I would claw through hell to get to each other if we were kept apart. And that poor man was crying! Judge Judy thank you.,2,aww
love judge judy for her bitchiness,   it's great.    She is a dog lover,   obviously.   The only thing in her pantry in NYC is dog food,   hilarious.   I just hate how she doesn't understand how to judge certain cases,    which is odd since she has the experience.   I noticed this in abuse cases and a few others --  she simply has never experienced it and doesn't understand that people rarely report abuse for various reasons.  Well known to most.   I realize she needs evidence,   and in this case saw it plainly....I think....but she is irrational and uninformed at times.   Still love her!,2,aww

Judge Judy's the fuckin bomb.,2,aww
Not to bust anyones balls in this, because it seems to me the guy really loves the dog, so I'm happy he gets it. But my moms dog will go apeshit the first 2 minutes of seeing me whenever I visit. Anyone she remotely recognize she will absolutely freak out over seeing. So it may just be that inital 2 minute spaz-out. Not that the dog doesn't love the guy, but if the roles were reversed and the guy had been with the dog all day and it hadn't seen the woman for a while, it might be just as happy to see her too.,2,aww
What kind of terrible person would keep a dog from its owner,2,aww
I mean this is cute and all but some dogs will do that to everyone.  I work at an animal shelter and we hold the strays from our county.  When a person come to claim a dog we require proof (vet records, pictures) and some people will say "just let the dog see me and you'll know it's mine."  That may be true but it's certainly not hardcore enough proof to send the dog home with that person.  People try to claim/steal small cute dogs a lot.,2,aww
This reminds me of a r/thathappened post come to life: "the dog jumped out of her arms and ran to me.....everybody clapped",2,aww
you could show this in any country with no words, no sounds and every person would know exactly whats going on here.,2,aww
That was awesome! Lol. That lady has some nerve.,2,aww
I did not think it was possible to love Judge Judy even more.,2,aww
What kind of sicko would steal someone's dog? It's cruel to the person and the dog. Just get your own dog, they practically give them away at shelters.,2,aww

I know judge Judy is "scripted" but I'm glad that dude got his dog back. People who steal dogs are some of the worst scum known to man.,2,aww
Judge Judy should be on the Supreme Court.,2,aww
"That's all, take the dog home." -Judge Judy with the mic drop,2,aww
My roommate has a dog and while she's 100% his, she's like 90% mine too. If that makes sense. She'd be happy if my roommate left and couldn't take her and I became her owner. But she's 100% his if we're both in the same room. Until she figures out the perfect spot so we can both pet her.,2,aww
Judge Judy is the one celebrity I underestimated their net worth by the most, she makes so much from sick kids staying home and moms,2,aww
I literally just watched this on YouTube. Creepy.,2,aww
So cute,2,aww
I had a pet cougar that greeted everyone the same.,2,aww
Those are terrible f'n people. I am glad that man and his dog are reunited. 🐕♥️,2,aww
Judy da BOSS,2,aww
Are real cases presented in these shows? I've heard it's either fake, or people in show bring cases that they couldn't afford to go through real courts for.,2,aww
Not gonna lie, this made me tear up 😢 so beautiful ♥️♥️♥️,2,aww
This made me so happy I just can't even handle it,2,aww
Judge judy is the shit. She doesnt fuck around with your bullshit,2,aww

Love this! Fuck that lady,2,aww
I'm glad judge Judy didn't "king Solomon" the dog.,2,aww
I always liked judge Judy, even though she is a judge who makes money for berating people she tells it like it is. Also she doesn't tolerate people's bullshit and is extremely non biased...people may disagree but hell if I was her age I'd be like " that's a kind of woman I'd want to call me on my bullshit" and tells me when my shit stinks, literally and figuratively.,2,aww
That's some Air Bud shit right there. RIP,2,aww
This is easily my favorite thing on the internet. The joy that dog had of finding his long lost friend is infectious. And the short shot of the guy holding back tears.... C'mon!!,2,aww
I have a question,  i dont watch television especially not American, are these types of shows authentic? Is that a real judge doing actual law cases? Or is it staged performance replicating real court cases?,2,aww
I'm crying, people.,2,aww
This is beautiful.,2,aww
Omg this is so cute!,2,aww
Didn't plan on crying again tonight... :'),2,aww
Nice! I think I remember this one. Good to see an ending like this one.,2,aww
Dog thieves are such horrible human beings wow,2,aww
"court room" . . . tv set> retired Manhattan family court judge. The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claim disputes within a _simulated courtroom set_. All parties involved must sign contracts agreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin.While they do sign contracts for arbitration she isn't a judge anymore so her "rulings" aren't final say and anything she "rules" on is possible to be taken further in an actual court.,2,aww
Real life Air Bud,2,aww
There should be montages of the stupidest shit people say on Judge Judy.,2,aww
I remember this case very clearly (defendant won't return dog she claimed she rescued because it's now part of her family, real owner sues to get dog back) and now I can re-watch / get good feels whenever I want. Thanks, OP.,2,aww
God dammit, dogs are the best!!!,2,aww
If someone stole my pet, we'd be in front of a criminal judge because I'd either beat the shit out of the them or kill them. Don't mess with my pets. That's like messing with someone's kids.,2,aww
It's like Air Bud!,2,aww
"Courtroom",2,aww
Its fake tv,2,aww
Isn't this show staged? Or just dumb reenactments? I always assumed Judge Judy is a judge like Dr. Phil is a psychiatrist..I haven't owned cable in a decade. .,2,aww
 I've watched this like 10 times already it's so good lol,2,aww
Judge Judy is the law.,2,aww
This dog looks so much like my dog that passed away last year...i miss her so much...what I wouldn't do to have her run at me like that again...,2,aww
I'm not crying..... YOU'RE CRYING!!,2,aww
Who's cutting onions this time of night?,2,aww

I've never heard of anyone being able to fake that reaction from a dog. I don't know all dogs, of course.,2,aww
3000th commentI'm happy that the dog is happy,2,aww
What a cute little doggy! I love Judge Judy, she's wonderful!,2,aww
Ah, thanks for being an animal lover judge Judy.,2,aww
Wait, is this court TV stuff actually real? Haven't watched it in like 10 years,2,aww
What episode is this?,2,aww
Man this clip would be so much better if judge Judy didn't have a show and successful career,2,aww
I'm not crying... my eyes are just leaking!,2,aww
Awwwww,2,aww
So cute,2,aww
If someone tried to steal my dog I might be spending a few nights in jail because I would probably flip out on someone and pound their head in.,2,aww
Good job! I'm so happy for that guy!,2,aww
I'm digging the good moments we've been getting from Judge Judy content. But was it just me? I hated this lady when she was on TV. Is she still on TV? Anyways, she annoyed the hell out of me, just wondering if I was the only one.,2,aww

This is my favorite Reddit video so far (this week). I get tears every time I watch.,2,aww
I had that happen... Dog showed up at my apartment on the 4th of July. Walked right in and sat in the kitchen looking all sad.I got her on the porch and took her picture, put her on Craigslist.Guy emails me says "That's my dog!" So I go on the porch and call her by name, no response. OK, cool. I tell the guy "Look, you're welcome to come take a look, but don't get your hopes up because she's not answering to that name..."Dude doesn't have a car so he calls a buddy with this beat up old pickup truck.Now the whole time I'm sitting with her to make sure she doesn't run off and she's hanging her head like the world ended.Then she hears this guy's truck and goes RUNNING down the stairs jumping and barking.Yeah, man, that's your dog.,2,aww
Why can't people just be honest? Do you really like a dog you barely know enough to lie to the owners face who you know LOVES that dog?  I can't imagine taking my new puppy and telling me that it now belongs to them and then have them lie about why puppy is sleeping on my foot? (it's weird but my puppy loves feet.),2,aww
Is there another time where judge Judy is any more fuckin awesome.,2,aww
This belongs in r/landslidevictory if there is such a thing!,2,aww
I watched this so much. I couldn't imagine someone trying to keep me away from my family member like that. Way to go J.J.,2,aww
While watching Judge Judy was fun, it made me realize that no amount of education can benefit stupid people, and that they outnumber smart people 10,000 to 1.,2,aww
Judge Judy is such a badass.,2,aww
I had to punch a fucking wall to feel manly again﻿,2,aww
In all fairness, dogs will do this to "everybody they know well". When my parents come visit, my dog goes nuts to see my dad. She goes equally nuts when either of my brothers comes visit.I am 100% certain under the same circumstances if they hadn't seen either of them in 2 years, and I walked her into a courtroom in the same fashion, she would immediately gravitate to them wanting to see them and lick them.Does that mean shes not my dog?,2,aww
What kind of vile sack of shit steals someones dog.,2,aww

I imagine he was reading a newspaper, he put it down temporarily, his glasses slid down the slope of his nose a bit so he could look you straight in the eye without a piece of glass in the way. He delivered the line, pushed his glasses back up, and then leaned back and continued reading the paper.,2,aww
The fuck's that dog doing in a court room anyway? Only in America.,2,aww
This is like that old story where pre presidential Abe Lincoln was a judge and was meant to decide who was the owner of a horse that was supposedly stolen and he did it by standing both of the involved parties on either end of a field and the idea was the horse would go to its owner so the horse ran to the guy and Abe Lincoln was like "it's his dog". Please tell me I'm not the only one that's heard that story ._.,2,aww
Also that's not a courtroom.,2,aww

First time I've cried watching a judge Judy clip,2,aww
NOT A COURT ROOM!!!!,2,aww
L O Y A L     B O Y E,2,aww
The dog will surely recognize his owner. First is the owner's smell and then the owners voice.,2,aww
Cute but so clearly staged.,2,aww
...in "court room.",2,aww
Love how the case is immediately settled after that.,2,aww
My friend found a jack russell/chiuauau dog roaming the streets 6months ago. We put it all over the internet, lost and found groups but no owner came forward.  I have the dog now and it is like my 4th child. I feel bad for whoever lost their dog and it would be tough for me to give her up if anyone ever responded to the posts. Not sure what I would do. My kids love this dog too. Her name is Valentine brought her home on Valentine's day. http://imgur.com/2ZSzC1Y,2,aww
dog teach you about loyalty and love,2,aww
I don't know the context at all, and I think it's pretty clear the dog is his since he seems a lot more emotional about it than those girls. However my dogs both go ape shit like that every time they recognize someone as well. They more or less molest each of my friends when they visit.,2,aww
Cut the dog in half!,2,aww
The dog definitely belongs to the man!! Glad he got his baby back!!,2,aww
This made me very happy 😊 don't steal other people's dogs ya hoe,2,aww
TIL if I ever lose my dog I have to bring my fiancé to court with me because for some reason my dog hates me,2,aww
What a charade.There's a lesson here - when something hits us in the feels - we forget to think.(not saying the dog isn't his - just that this is staged from beginning to end).,2,aww
That's a man who loves his dog. Shit I'm at work and miss my dog now. 🐕,2,aww
Judge Judy fucking rocks,2,aww
Wish the dog had bit that woman,2,aww
This is the most upvoted post i have ever seen,2,aww

This is why we need to chip our pets. So no one steals them from us.,2,aww
And this was the day  The dog who knew 'sit' and 'stay'  Got to learn:  'Hearsay',2,aww
Incoming top reddit post of all time! The gif is a karma magnet of the gods.,2,aww
That warmed my heart. My coworker is dealing with a rough (no pun intended) situation where he let a well reviewed and respected trainer take his dog and the trainer "lost" him. After finding some evidence including surveillance and multiple lies/stories not matching up he suspects the guy stole his dog, sold it or did something to it and is lying. Wish this was the outcome for my coworker instead.,2,aww
So me and an ex girlfriend split up and she kept the Maltese I bought her. After about 2 months she couldn't take care of the dog as often so my mom and her would split custody. I couldn't since my new apartment doesn't allow dogs. I goto moms about once every other week and that dog loves my mother to death. Once I walk in the house though it forgets all about her and goes apeshit over me.Here's the kicker if my uncle visits (and he visits once a month) and I'm at moms the dog will go crazy for my uncle and forget about me. I'd bet if my uncle was in the courtroom and my ex who has spent way more time with the dog walked in the court the same situation would've happened.,2,aww
If the dog sits, you must acquit,2,aww
Stolen dog*,2,aww
I truly can't think of anything I've seen on Reddit that I've loved more than this.,2,aww
u/maxexodus look at this cute fucking shit,2,aww
Hell yeah Judge Judy.,2,aww
My doggo ran away about a year ago. She was missing for close to a week. One day we got a call from the vet saying someone brought her in and they scanned her microchip etc etc. Luckily she was fine, the people who had picked her up lived in a big house with a huge yard and two bulldogs, they said they really loved her and if we wanted to sell her they would love to buy her. Of course we declined that offer super fast and brought her back home ASAP.,2,aww
That's a true dog owner, you can see the love in his eye,2,aww
Is someone in here cutting onions?,2,aww
As someone who had the ex take my dog, I find this deeply satisfying.,2,aww
"I'm taking the dog, dumbass",2,aww
Judge Judy is a boss,2,aww
If you take my dog the last thing you will worry about is your defence in court.,2,aww
Judge Judy is for sure an animal lover, she's great, she has a schticky show, but she always comes down on the side of animals. There was an episode of Pitbulls and Parolees where they'd had this very aggressive dog on premises, and they couldn't tame her, she still growled at the workers, and then one day someone claiming to be her owner calls up. They drive the dog to her yard, the *sec*ond this dog gets a whiff of her owner, she becomes a pile of mush and affection. Tia could pet her, she rolled over, she was completely different. Her owner used to be in a bad area where the dog had to be protective, she kept that mindset until she saw her owner again. Really incredible.,2,aww
Can those women be put in front of a  firing squad for trying to steal this man's poor dog?,2,aww
Best. Judge. Ever.,2,aww
„He does that to everybody“ she says while in a room with 50 other people.,2,aww

This post probably could have used a better title. I was under the impression as the gif started that someone was just bringing the dog in who was wandering around outside. Probably a better title "Stolen dog immediately recognizes his true owner in court room",2,aww
If the dog did that to everyone it would have ran to everyone.  It didn't.  It ran to one person.  I love this reunion.,2,aww
This is a great reason to microchip your pets!  Scan the chip, identification number comes up, they check the I'd number with what's on file, and there you go all the information you should need.,2,aww

Geez, every dog that lady walks in with runs right to him! He must have a lot of white poodles!  😄,1,aww
My dog is a highly desirable breed and coloring, and he's super shy and friendly, so I'm absolutely terrified of having him stolen. Like I will never ever leave him tied up outside a store. I also going to order this "FitBit for dogs" thing that includes GPS tracking, and is small enough that I can attach it to his collar and then slide a bandana over it to make it invisible, because the thought of him getting stolen scares the shit out of me.But at least I know if I ever had to prove he was my dog, I'd just have to walk into his line of sight. He approaches most people, even people he knows fairly well, pretty timidly with his tail between his legs. But when he sees me, at first it's like "is that really you?" followed by "HOLY SHIT IT IS YOU THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER." Like even if I leave the apartment for 15 minutes, that's his reaction when I come back.,1,aww
Could not like be this more!,1,aww

Doesn't Judge Judy make like $45 million a year or something for her show?  Do you ever wonder how the economic mathematics of that works out?,1,aww
If I was in court and my brother walked in with his dog it would run and greet me the same way. When I come to visit it gets so excited it pees itself. If anyone else comes and visits it could care less. For some reason I am his dogs favorite person and it isn't close. If I'm over it will never leave my side. I might have to steal his dog,1,aww

I have mad respect for Judge Judy. She could have easily been a flash in the pan celebrity from the 90s, ending up on an E! special about where she is now. And yet she has managed to stay relevant and more importantly, make some mad bank for like 20 years,1,aww
Ohhhh I'm such a fucked up person for secretly thinking the dog is just a happy little Doug and would do this to anyone and that lady may have actually lost her dog lmao,1,aww

I feel like my dog might run to my mother in this situation. (No, we do not live together; I suspect she secretly gives him junk food.),1,aww
Belongs in r/Judge_Judy_for_SCOTUS,1,aww
That's the best thing I've seen all day,1,aww
Judge Judy for president.,1,aww
this made me cry.,1,aww
First time I've seen her not be an asshole. That was a fast case also lol.,1,aww
Is this a movie or is this a real court?,1,aww
Right in them feels,1,aww
I have the same sort of dog and she does that to everyone,1,aww
is judge judy an actual courtroom or is it fictitious?,1,aww
Do you mean 'stolen' dog?,1,aww
In all fairness as a girl whose owned a lady beagle herself since puppyhood, my dog is a whore for any standard white guy with a beard. She loves them.,1,aww
"court room",1,aww
As soon as the dog got closer even before that man said anything you can see the dog smelling his scent and starting to wriggle out of her arms getting excited. So cute,1,aww
I think everyone needed this today.,1,aww
Obviously staged,1,aww
I teared up a little,1,aww
Though if you watch the source, when she says he does that to everybody he's actually jumping excitedly back to her. So it might be he was attached to both of them which is sad too.,1,aww
Meanwhile I went to say hi to my cat after he was living with my brother for 3 months, he wouldn't even go near me :(,1,aww
The lady said that the dog "does that to everyone".  Well, not quite.  The dog ran right past her to see the man.,1,aww
There was a couple college girls who tried to adopt a puppy from the humane society but he was spoken for. So they fucking went into the kennels and stole it. It was on camera so they got caught right away.... but still,1,aww
"Lost",1,aww
The iq q,1,aww
This is some Air Bud shit,1,aww
I read about this. The situation sucks for both. She bought a dog, grew attached to it, and did not want to part with it. But it was clearly that mans dog.Personally if I was the guy, I would have talked to the lady let her know she could come visit when ever she wanted, or take him at her place from time to time.Who ever stole the dog and created this situation for these to is most definitely scum.,1,aww
"Court room",1,aww
People do this to their own own helpless children for selfish reasons. As sickening as it is , it's not a surprise people do it to animals.,1,aww
Is there a legit reason someone would steal a dog?,1,aww
In the clip, the lady who bought the dog off the street tells the girl not to put the dog down. Honestly, not a big fan of her,1,aww
Unfortunately my dog would do this for anyone she has spent a lot of time around. She'll stick with me when she calms down, but initial contact with someone she recognizes is very exciting. If it was done this way, I would be screwed if I had a crazy ex who wanted to steal my dog.,1,aww
Check his pockets, probably has treats in them shits,1,aww
Guile's theme goes with this...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGw8DWctAts,1,aww
Lmfao "ya take the dog, its yours.",1,aww
This made me happy, thank you,1,aww
Is that a Bichon Frise?,1,aww
Judge Judy loves dog, its her secret weakness.,1,aww
Am I the only one with hidden onions in the room??? Somethings irritating my eyes. Just. Can’t. Stop. Tearing up.,1,aww
Before walking became an issue for our dog (lame leg, bad hip), she would behave the same way whenever my mom was around. She still gets excited to see her, despite also going blind, too.,1,aww
So romantic,1,aww
This reminds me of a time not so long ago in a land not so far away. I was watching cartoons one sleepless night at 3am, when all of a sudden I hear a massive ruckus taking place on my yonder porch. With heart rate beating a heavy tattoo in my ears I hesitantly a peered onto said mentioned porch. When's all of a sudden a small fur ball cute as a button did appear, my freshly knock over garbage hanging out its cute teeth. Two score months pass and I had made the little ruffian my own. A small little Pittbull, who stole my heart along with my garbage. She peed on my floor and ate my food, making herself right at home in my domicile. She a bore no tags, a no name. So I kept her as my own. Posting flyers for the little whippersnapper around.Three score more months pass by and the little tike was growing quickly, when as suddenly as she appeared I hear a knocking. A pale lady came bearing the flier, her eyes filled with misty tears when she a saw my little fur ball. Then the little skank herself run up to the teary eyed damsel, forever leaving me with thoughts of what could have been. Bitch.,1,aww
This is nice and all, and I'm sure this has been pointed out, but what if the dog lived with that guy for a while and knows him very well, but just hasn't seen him in a long time? I'm just not entirely sure that behaviour suggests he *owns* the dog, but the dog will be happy with him anyway.,1,aww
"court room",1,aww
They stole this from Air Bud,1,aww
This actually made me tear up. So adorable.,1,aww
It's like the scene from Air Bud,1,aww
Man I needed that today.,1,aww
Fucking Judge Judy giving me the feels - it's like a combination of /r/Frisson and /r/WTF.,1,aww
So, it's a custody battle over a dog?Wow.  Sorta reminds me of the king who had two women in his court arguing over how the baby belonged to.  The king gets fed up with the bickering in front of him, and tells them that, if they can't agree on who gets sole ownership, he'd cut the baby in half and give them each a piece.One woman nearly screams at the idea, and begs the other woman to just take the baby.The king gives the baby to the woman offering to give it away instead of having the baby killed.,1,aww
No No he does that to everyone.,1,aww
This is my happiest and most deserved upvote.,1,aww
Fuck yeah,1,aww
Pieces of shit like that who steal a dog and then lie about it ought to be charged with having stolen property. They are the lowest form of life.,1,aww
u/WaterGuy12 would love this,1,aww
Literally almost cried.,1,aww
Lol that's funny,1,aww
A,1,aww
This is definitely real and not at all scripted.  Judge Judy, and daytime TV as a whole, is known for its authenticity.,1,aww
Good job he didn't loose his cat.,1,aww
Just in case you thought this show was real...,1,aww
Hold up judge Judy is real? Lol I thought it was scripted lmao,1,aww
Awww!!! That little dog was overwhelmed to see it's daddy. I'm glad it turned out well for the dog.,1,aww

Stealing dogs should be punishable by death.,1,aww
To prove the point...my dog would have humped me for good measure,1,aww
Fuck yes. I love this,1,aww
Man I would hate to have a dog like that. Just watching this makes me tear up, can't imagine having him and someday losing him too,1,aww
could it be the best post/repost ever on /r/aww?,1,aww
Judge Judy for supreme court,1,aww
That extreme close up on judge judys face when she started nodding when the dog ran up to him had me in stitches,1,aww
I fucking hate petty people,1,aww
That judge kicks ass.,1,aww
Can someone plz link this episode on YouTube,1,aww
Punish those women , they are not good human beings,1,aww
Poor woman, poor the man, poor the dog, fuck the fucking thief.,1,aww
Context?,1,aww
Awwww,1,aww
are these things staged or real cases?,1,aww
Glad the owner is reunited with his dog, they seem really happy to see eachother.,1,aww
"Lost" and "stolen" are not the same.  That doggo was clearly stolen.,1,aww
Is there a video of this anywhere?,1,aww
So you've been watching Judge Judy clips on YouTube, huh?,1,aww
source videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g,1,aww
Yeah Judge Judy you tell em.,1,aww
Something about big black dudes loving and owning small dogs warms my heart. That lady needs to go check out the local shelter and find her own creature of unconditional love.,1,aww
Got to love that ruling.,1,aww
This is so adorable...,1,aww
"Thats what happens when you buy it for 50 bucks infront of the mall",1,aww
Same thing happened to a girl I dated in highschool. Her neighbors watched their dog, liked it, and literally took it,1,aww
What episode is this?,1,aww
I would have thought the dog would have started chasing the Byrd,1,aww
If that was a cat. It will say "fuck you" to its owner as he runs towards the food.,1,aww
That lady to the left in the audience when she first walks in really hated her nose,1,aww
Where's the dog in this gif??,1,aww
Ok stupid question, are these real court cases, or is judge Judy strictly entertainment?,1,aww
The dog even acted like a child who finds it mother.,1,aww
Ruff justice.,1,aww
Isn't this stuff staged though?,1,aww
Dog custody trials always make me emotional.,1,aww
Question of genuine interest. Is judge Judy a legal judge?,1,aww
"Court",1,aww
The owner did not immediately pick up his dog when he was jumping excitedly around him. Which owner wouldn't? Makes me a little suspicious about him being the real owner or not.,1,aww
Have we learned nothing from that one spongebob episode,1,aww
/r/eyebleach,1,aww
AMAZING!!!!,1,aww
Whelp, there goes me not crying today.,1,aww
Thanks!!,1,aww
Is this a show or something ?,1,aww

Dogs are awesome,1,aww
Why tf would that dude lie about the dog being his? Lol,1,aww
You're crying,1,aww
too good,1,aww
*tv studio,1,aww
You can tell the second he smells him and he probably hasnt smelt him in so long and hes so damn happy.,1,aww
I had a bad day today and this really made me smile,1,aww
This is why I respect judge Judy,1,aww
This is why you microchip your dog!,1,aww
That was super satisfying to see.,1,aww
This warmed my cold dead heart,1,aww
I fucking love judge Judy smh,1,aww
"Court",1,aww
Seeing this makes me want to cry also,1,aww
I bet you money there is a treat in his pocket,1,aww
We don't deserve Judge Judy,1,aww
"court",1,aww
but, it was his dog. Sorry.,1,aww
My dog does that to everyone. I hope I never have to go to court.,1,aww
Can someone let me know what episode this was so I can watch it?,1,aww
this is as real as every other reality tv show out there.,1,aww
No video?,1,aww
Those puppies always say the truth dude,1,aww
Maybe he is just a dog whisperer who knew saying "hey baby boy" would net him a free dog...,1,aww
I don't think anyone will ever understand how much I needed to see this today.,1,aww
-Put the dog down!-Really your honor? Right here in the middle of the court?,1,aww
Judge Judy and executioner,1,aww
Dogs are just great.,1,aww
Don't care how staged it is, that's how my pupper reacts to me coming home, that shit is REAL.,1,aww
Judge Judy's nod of approval, I need a gif of that.,1,aww
That instantly made my day lmao,1,aww
I've watched this 20 times and smile or tear up each time.,1,aww
Lmao mans best friend,1,aww
The dog clearly knows who dad is!Good dog!,1,aww
What exactly was this case about?,1,aww
nothing better in the entire world than dogs :),1,aww
I would be in tears at first sight if I saw my dog in that fashion after that many months of being forced apart.,1,aww
Gotta hand it to Judge Judy,1,aww
I love this,1,aww
I loved it when another lady came in with a very similar looking dog right after!,1,aww
Judge Judy owning chumps like usual.,1,aww
>Courtroom-->Judge Judy,1,aww
Man I'm way to drunk to watch this right now 😭😭😭 lol,1,aww
Why did this bring a tear to my eye?,1,aww
Hope the lady found a new dog that loved her too.,1,aww
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g,1,aww
This is some wise king solomon business right here,1,aww
I was just looking at pics and videos of my dog cause I miss him so much. I won't see him till Thursday and haven't seen him since last Tuesday. I then click on this and started crying. Fuck I don't wanna go away without my boy again,1,aww
Did they really need Judge Judy to point something so obvious out?,1,aww
"Court room",1,aww
Lol that doggo is longgo,1,aww
I wonder how the case even came about,1,aww
My dog acts like this anytime someone enters my apartment. Everytime my brother in law visits by dog goes apeshit. Not sure how he'd act in a full court room though.,1,aww
Why can't I view this?,1,aww
Awww,1,aww
This is amazing!,1,aww
loving animal,1,aww
It's not every day you get to see the birth of a new sub on the front page!,1,aww
Love my dog, but her dumb butt would go up to everyone. Lol However, I am glad he got his dog back. :),1,aww
And now, for another quick mystery:Dog: "Where's my human?!"Guy: "Right here, buddy"Judge Judy: "Case closed."Wow, that one was *really* fast.,1,aww
To be fair, when I go visit my parents, our dog freaks out and gets so excited to see me for like a few minutes, then retreats back to his real favorites--my mom or dad.,1,aww
Can I upvote this twice please,1,aww
Probably had a cookie in his pocket,1,aww
That's the kind of boost I need before work :),1,aww
Isn't that staged? It looks staged.,1,aww
I honestly don't know of anyone ever having their pet stolen...,1,aww
GET FUKT LADY,1,aww

Lol "court room",1,aww
No wonder she is the highest paid Tv star.,1,aww
Put the dog down? Wow Judie, harsh.,1,aww
What was het punicement? Somebody who knows IT?,1,aww
Simply Beautiful. I'm so glad that dogs will always be wonderful, loyal friends to us.,1,aww
Awww they stuck to the script,1,aww
I can't help but think of the 0.1% chance where it's actually there dog and they are acting strange that day,1,aww
We do not deserve dogs! They are amazing,1,aww
source : https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g,1,aww
Wait I'm confused did the lady who had the dog like take the dog and she basically saying it's hers buts it not,1,aww
i can hear this in her voice "its his dwog",1,aww
Wowie,1,aww
my dad produced a dad comment when I showed him this. He said. Oh so the guys name is Everybody?,1,aww
I'm not going to scroll and see if it's been posted but these shows are a scam.  The looser pays nothing.  The show pays all damages.  You might as well make up a story with your best friend then pretend to sue them then split the winnings.,1,aww
Chances are both of these people are very much aware who the dog owner is. Even though there may have been a legal battle at some point, they were most likely payed to act as if there were still an actual dispute. Regardless of the outcomes on Judge Judy, both parties to a case emerge as winners. That's because the show pays for the arbitration award, along with the litigants' airfare and hotel expenses. For most litigants, that adds up to a free trip to Los Angeles.,1,aww
My favorite part is Judge Judy seeing the dog going nuts for his owner and she's just like "yup. Dog is his",1,aww
Stalking your Reddit account and I wasn't prepared to see your asshole.,1,aww
Oh my dog!,1,aww
Has anybody mentioned Rick and Morty yet?,1,aww
"In court room"Maybe should be"On TV set",1,aww
Source/Clip,1,aww
Certain things you see just being a tear to your eye and this got me. A dogs love and loyalty to their owner is unbeatable,1,aww
This would really piss me off if Judge Judy wasn't staged.,1,aww
Will everyone stop peeling those onions?  I'm TRYING to watch the clip!,1,aww
I wish I had Judge Judy when my ex wife stole my dog.,1,aww

God i love Judge Judy.,1,aww

This is one smooth judge ...."That's all, take the dog home"*Drops mic*,1,aww
This is the happiest thing I've seen all day.,1,aww
Lol, I watched that same gif for ten minutes strait.,1,aww
This breaks my heart. We just found a puppy this past weekend that was nearly starved to death. We nursed it back to health only for the owners to recognize it this morning. We gave it back of course, but not before they accused us of stealing it and threatening to call the police. Absolute vile scum.,1,aww
This reminds me of the time my dog went missing, spent an hour or so looking for her, found her with an old woman. For obvious reasons she was sceptical as to whether it was our dog or not. So I said "bring her 'round to mine, soon as she sees my step dad, you'll know she's our"Lo and behold, the second she saw him she acted exactly like this. It's nice to know she's back with her loving owner.,1,aww
My dog wouldn't do that. She is a total attention whore and will go to anyone 😂,1,aww
Context please...,1,aww
i am real lover of it.,1,aww
I'm not crying, you're crying.,1,aww
the girl said "no." before putting him down, she knew shed screwed up,1,aww
I often wonder how much of this is staged. Or is this show at least semi legit?,1,aww
Reminds me of the film/book Annie.  So cute,1,aww
I always preferred Night Court.....Judy was never remotely convincing in a stage managed tv studio.,1,aww
@brocollimonster :3,1,aww
Mind Blowing,1,aww
I love Judge Judy. Such a legend.,1,aww
OMG,1,aww
my landlord's dog responds to me like this when he hasn't seen me for a while,1,aww
If that was my dog he would be wanting down asap and running to everyone in the room, nevermind me,1,aww
You could see the dog recognize his smell first.,1,aww
Can someone tell me what's the name of this episode?,1,aww
Is it a teddy.......,1,aww
It's judge judy - i always wondered, is it fake?,1,aww
Does everybody think, that this is real? Isn't it a scripted show?,1,aww

gif got stuck.. i put the dog down =(,1,aww
Try it with a cat this time. I would love to see that haha.,1,aww
I love Judge Judy for being so succinct. "Take the dog home.",1,aww
I have a maltese at home. When she sees someone she recognises after a long time, she behaves exactly this way. She sometimes cries a bit and barks as well, in excitement.I'm not sure if this was an accurate way to justify the ownership of the dog.If it was a wrong verdict, I feel really bad for those ladies.,1,aww
Why does this look so fake.,1,aww
Well that was expected, possibly,1,aww
ITT People who don't seem to understand this is a fake scripted TV show.,1,aww
Animals don't lie!,1,aww
Damn it! I couldn't watch the video.Just a black screen.,1,aww
No time for that,1,aww
I can't believe how low people can get.. Seriously? stealing someone's pet?,1,aww
you do realize those are staged?,1,aww
Same way my doggie got excited the 2 times he got lost. First in the pound than at the humane society. First time some one had "claimed" him.....,1,aww
Is this like an actual court or is it a reality show? (Judge jody),1,aww
You are...the father!!!,1,aww

One of the few times that someone actually loses something on Judge Judy,1,aww
Nice little moment. not often you see a case that sweet. The defendant got screwed when the 'baby boy' was brought into court. Still...aww indeed :),1,aww
I'm tearing up ..don't judge me! You don't know my life!,1,aww
I don't own a dog, but when I do... you fuck with me you die,1,aww
Justice served, much satisfaction.,1,aww
Pet reunions always make me cry. I never cry, not even in funerals... but doggies reunited with their bestest friend gets me every time.,1,aww
I don't know the back story on this, but I hope after what this man went through that he made sure to microchip his dog. It can really help to make sure a lost or stolen dog makes its way back home.,1,aww
Okkm,1,aww
My dog woundnt do that tho this isn't full proof,1,aww

This lost all credibility as soon as I realized it was Judge Judy.,1,aww
The good ol' treats in the pocket.  Works everytime.,1,aww
This is so wholesome. And moving. I'm crying. 😭,1,aww
The fact that he probably met the woman and had to bring this to court is what pisses me off. If you want a dog, and have the means to take care of one, get a dog, dont take someone elses.,1,aww
damn so mesmerizing,1,aww
You can tell who is right and wrong by the meanness on the face of the horrible dog stealer versus the nice guy who rightfully owned the dog.*Bangs gavel*,1,aww
NO DOGS ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM. judy: bring me the  dog,1,aww
Love judge Judy!!!,1,aww
I was hanging out in the car with our Bostons while my husband dashed into the grocery store one day.   Some people came up to me and complimeneted the dogs and then just straight out said "so how much you want for them?", as if I would just sell two of the three reasons I care about existing in order to provide for.  Am certain they would have stolen them had I not been there.,1,aww
Looks like the dog was "Wait? Is that?" And one he goes "Hey, boy!" He recognized his voice.,1,aww
That's EXACTLY how my dog would act... except he would be barking at anyone who looked at me or got near me lol,1,aww
Wow already one of the top posts of all time , of course there's judge Judy in it.,1,aww

When I was a kid, we adopted a dog from a shelter, my sister and I we're out front playing with him when he did something like this, it was very unusual for him so it was really weird.  The family he ran up to just looked at him shocked and said "DogsName?!?" It was his previous owners, they had 3 kids but the third had an allergy to dogs so they had to give him up.  It was heartbreaking hearing him wimper when they left.,1,aww

Where I use to live, ppl steals dogs and sadly, it happened to me with both of my dogs.The first was stolen when we was out one day and learned from the neighbor wife a seven months later, her husband came over to our house and cut the rope from the pole and tried to take him but Lil guy bite him and fought back. Dude got pissed off and rip off my dog collar and called animal control and said there was a stray dog attacking him and they took my poor dog away and we went to see where gave him away to see where we can get him back but sadly, they put him down.The neighbor moved(it's why she told us) after her husband went to jail for shooting a clerk at a mini store.Second dog was stolen after we give it away to a friend. She told us that she let him out on her yard to pee and run around when kids from her block came running to her door, saying a guy came out of a yellow car and jumped over fence and grabbed him with a bag and took off. We have no idea what happened him but I heard rumors there was a dog fighting ring in the city and I feared that what happened to him. He's a toy dog but I bet the asshole didn't care,1,aww
Any idea what episode this is?,1,aww
And that's why I'm a dog person,1,aww
Oh you know, same ol' same ol' sup widd yah?,1,aww

That's one hyper pupper,1,aww
Word to the wise. Never buy a random pet off of the street.,1,aww
I would like to see the entire show. What could those women say?,1,aww
Judge Judy gets paid $45 million dollars a year to yell at people who have absolutely nothing.,1,aww
And dogs don't just use their sight to recognize someone, they use their sense smell too. That's a pretty positive ID.,1,aww
Commenting for posterity.,1,aww
Now I'm even more confused,1,aww
Love this story!,1,aww
Actually cried. Wtf man ಠ_ಠ,1,aww
Man, a dog never lies! But cats, that a whole different story! Boom!,1,aww
The people who kept this dog and owner apart are scum. Humiliation on TV is not nearly what they deserved.,1,aww

Fuck kinda court case is this... "Whose dog is it anyway?",1,aww
This is judge Judy?,1,aww
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate,1,aww
Judge Judy is a good show and all but seriously they could have easily staged this by picking a case this easy and delicate,1,aww
Judge Judy is so annoying.,1,aww
>> court roomI see what you did there.,1,aww
Lol why is this gif 174mb,1,aww
Awww. it was heart-wrenching :'(,1,aww
Who steals a dog??,1,aww
Wasn't this the plot of a Disney channel movie?,1,aww
I actually seen this episode on TV,1,aww
a comment.,1,aww
Heh,1,aww
I must have missed the part where he ran to everybody in the court room,1,aww
That close in is the best part.,1,aww
I want to smoke the upvote button 1000 times on this.,1,aww
Judge Judy is Solomon,1,aww
"He does that to everybody" he literally just ran right past you,1,aww
That lady is a fucking bitch. “He does that to everybody.”,1,aww
my heart is GLOWING right now,1,aww
Sauce ?,1,aww
"I'm just gonna stand here now",1,aww
This reminds me a ton of the story of King Solomon trying to determine which woman was the real mother of the baby.,1,aww
This made me tear up,1,aww
Ho that's where the judge gif comes from,1,aww
Just me thinking that he could have deliberately put some yummy dog treats in his pockets? I think I’ve seen that done in movie(s), not sure if it would actually work :P,1,aww
I had my dog stolen by construction workers that were doing work where they had to pass through our yard and use our driveway. He was constantly running away and eventually ran from them and back to us.,1,aww
This is literally the ending to "Air Bud".,1,aww
You Americans dont understand that this is all staged?,0,aww
fukkin rekt,1,aww
So this is what Reddit has become? Judge Judy on front page.,1,aww
I really love the little nod and squint she made to the owner of the dog, the universal facial expression of "I got you." What an awesome clip,1,aww
Well how fucking scientific Judge Judy,1,aww
The guy may have had a bone in his pants,1,aww
My mom stole her neighbor's cat and had it neutered🤣,1,aww
The dogs obviously racist.,1,aww
 cameras & pets have 1 thing in common. They can't lie,1,aww
[deleted],1,aww
Takes dog home and "he dose that to everyone". Keeps dog.,1,aww
I want someone to look at me like this doggo looks at his owner,1,aww
Love it. Doggo comes in and is understandablely confused, then sees his human and is like "hey, wtf you doing here? I thought you left" "Hey boy" "FUCK YOU REMEMBER ME?!?!!? What the fuck is going on? Do you know this person? She took me! SHE TOOK ME BRO!!!!! SHE TOOK ME!!!" "Put the dog down" "BRO ITS ME YOU REMEMBER ME DONT YOU FUCK ITS YOU!!! HOLY SHIT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU!!!! SHIT MAN IM SO HAPPY FUCK I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE" "Pick the dog up" "YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS" Luvey luvey luv luvs!! "He does that to everyone" **"WHY ARE YOU TALKING HOE??"**,1,aww
The title is misleading, it should say "Dog recognizes owner in joke room".,1,aww
"courthouse",1,aww
Bullet to the head if you steal any of my animals,1,aww
You mean TV set.,1,aww
"Court room",1,aww
To be fair, if I brought my dog in the room, he would've done the same thing, excited to meet new people,1,aww

What moron buys gold for gallowboob?,50,aww
Can't dogs like, not see the picture on a TV? I'm guessing she's reacting to the sounds,10,aww

Boarder collie expert gallowboob,9,aww

This is so freaking cute,3,aww
huh! from the doggo's I've ever owned, they all seem to treat the TV as a bright, loud box and had little capacity to see shapes on the screen.,3,aww
*"Go me, Go me Go me"*,3,aww
This is me when I watch my own Snapchat stories over and over.,3,aww
Reminds me of Nintendogs!,3,aww
Do you think she realizes that is her?,3,aww
Captain Kirk! :>D,3,aww
 These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.,3,aww
r/GifsThatEndTooSoon.,3,aww
This is border-line adorable. Also always a great idea to study tape for next time,10,aww
They say the dogs don't recognize themselves in the mirror (or on TV?) but having had a border collie that was smarter than some people I have met, I disagree.  My dog's been gone over 25 years and I still miss her every day.,19,aww
Why name a girl Kirk?,9,aww
This is awesome,6,aww
"That's me! *bounce* *bounce* That's me!",4,aww
Border collies are so damn smart,4,aww
Great job on the pups part!!! Maybe purina should put as much effort as this dog to try and improve their subpar product. Anything made by purina is pure dog shit...and that's BEFORE the digestion!!!,6,aww
She’s amazing,2,aww
That’s adorable, she looks so proud of herself! Very aww worthy,2,aww
Border collies and aussies are damn near the same. That jumping is exactly what my dog does,2,aww
I was pumped for her.,2,aww

How do people train dogs to do this?,2,aww
Gotta watch tape if you wanna improve.,2,aww

Shout out to 2011 where this was all I did in Nintendogs to get more dogs.That time when I deleted my save and lost my labrador and couldn't stop crying for a week...,2,aww
Is her being a female any significant or are we all about gender rights for animals now?,2,aww
A pro at zoomies,2,aww

and it was not that many years back when animal science was saying dogs could see shapes and spaces on TV but they could never know what they were seeing. This here border collie knows he is watching kitty cat obsticle course on his HDTV! :),2,aww
Be your biggest fan,2,aww
6 days -> top u/GallowBoob postSeems legit,2,aww
Do you have a mirror?,2,aww
Who names a dog Kirk.. much less a female.,8,aww
This is wholesome as hell.,4,aww
This is probably a stupid question but is it possible to breed out their short lives? Can we breed them to live longer than 10 years? They love us so much but they leave us so soon :(,4,aww
God damn it not GallowBoob,4,aww
Gallowboob back at it again,4,aww
You’ve really got the recipe for karma down, u/gallowboob.,3,aww
Fun fact: just about none of the dogs who compete in this competition eat any Purina foods, because they're absolute trash foods made by a trash company.,2,aww
If only my nintendogs could do this,2,aww
TIL; This dog is infinitely smarter than most people I know. Can she become my manager?,2,aww
And they say dogs can't see themselves! Seems this pupper knew exactly what was going on.,1,aww
This is the most wholesome and wonderful thing ever!!!,3,aww
Dem mirror neurons,1,aww
I read the title as "Kirk, a former Border Collie..." and was like, but...then what is she now?!@,1,aww
Border collies are amazing,1,aww
Bordie collies are so smart it's amazing.  Their ability to learn is so incredible.  Very sensitive animals as well.   They need a lot of exercise and attention or they can really cause a lot of trouble.,1,aww
This is adorable,1,aww
*"Look at me! I was fabulous!"*,1,aww
Haaah!! I looks as if she’s trying to participate! Man I love dogs,1,aww

So I've always wondered why some dogs watch TV and others dont. My dog growing up didnt give a shit about dogs on TV or even dog sounds on TV. But then this dog and others online respond directly to TV.,1,aww
Awesome!,1,aww

This is awesome, please post the vid!,1,aww

That was 7 years ago. This dogs living in the past.,1,aww
Don't insult human intelligence, *Kirk!*,1,aww
That pupper is so excited.,1,aww
The internet may have been for porn, but now it's for this! And porn.,1,aww
My dog does the same thing while watching me play Fortnite.  Less bouncing with excitement, though... more just tilting his head as I transform without warning into a pile of weapons (mostly gray pistols).,1,aww
What a happiness :D,1,aww
fast as fuck,1,aww
CONCEITED!,1,aww
Awwwwwwewweeeeeee this is so sweet.,1,aww

Hilarious.    The heart of a champion!Love the pogo jumping.,1,aww

Imagine having this much self confidence/ pride in yourself.,1,aww
I love border Collies so much,1,aww
How is it possible that I didn't notice the dog jumping in front of the TV? I guess I was focusing on something else.,1,aww
Does this qualify as an audio commentary?,1,aww
Border collies should be classed as non-human persons.,1,aww
Dogs are very intelligent creatures! No doubt she knows she did something good,1,aww

This is adorable!,1,aww
I have so many theory of the mind questions.,1,aww
Yay! Go me!,1,aww
I have a Border Collie who is lazy. I remember when I first got them everyone told me that they are super high energy and need to be put to work so I took him on long hikes. Thirty minutes into a hike he just would roll over and relax.Right now he is laying on my couch above pillows.When I go in the backyard to go in the pool, he stays inside because he likes the AC.He just likes playing with his plush toys- Mr. Bill and elephant..by playing around I mean he just shakes them up and down like he is breaking their neck. Granted he's a Border Collie/Austrian Shepherd/Terrier/Corgie mix :),1,aww
This literally melts my heart,1,aww
Hey its me!,1,aww
Gotta support yourself no matter what. Always have to have your own bark, as they say,1,aww
I thought it was only us and dolphins that recognise themselves in mirrors etc. She's just watching TV 😋,1,aww
She’s almost coaching herself! She’s even ghosting the routine. (Jumps when running, tippy taps when going through tunnels, does jukes through poles..),1,aww
So they just named this dog without knowing it's a girl, right?  Do they have a son named Jessica?,1,aww
Next show her a video of herself reacting to watching herself on TV,1,aww
She *knows*.,1,aww
Kirk,1,aww
KOFY, Stereo TV 20, San Francisco,1,aww

THATS ME! THATS ME! THATS ME!,1,aww
To be the best you gotta study the tapes.,1,aww
She’s adorable!!! Love it 😝♥️,1,aww
Can dog comprehend TVs? Do they know what is that and if it's them and they're viewing a recording of themselves and not a actual scenario through a box.,1,aww
I know some species of animals can pass that self recognition test, (elephants for example, I think?) do some individuals in species that don't ever make that leap?,1,aww
So cute !,1,aww
Omg this is so cute,1,aww
That's meaning,1,aww
"I'm awesome",1,aww
This dog is so egotistical. Who watches their own performance and gets that excited.,1,aww
Quiet dignity is overrated!,1,aww
This is the kind of wholesome quality I need in my life. Thank you r/aww,1,aww

Too bad that dogs don't recognize themselves.,1,aww

She is just so precious! HUGS!,1,aww
Nice!,1,aww
How are Collie's so smart?Serious question. I have a rescue Pug, he's awesome, my good friend even, but I know he's a dork most of the time.,1,aww
She thought it was another dog and she was cheering them on.,1,aww
That's me...that's me...that's me.. Look! That's me...,1,aww

It looks like she’s kind of acting out the course,1,aww
This is the best thing ever,1,aww
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!,1,aww
I thought dogs couldn’t see TVs because their eyes don’t react fast enough? Clearly that’s not true though,1,aww

COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.,1039,aww
You have probably added  years to this dog’s life! You have done a great thing here.,14618,aww
When I first meet Buddy the poor guy could barely walk/waddle without getting out of breathe. He hated the leash and refused to leave his owner’s side so I had to carry him down the street and force him to walk back. Now he loves his daily walks and can even run.  So proud of Buddy! Edit 1: Thank you for the reddit gold and all the kind words!!!!Y’all are too kind! Edit 2: The before and after is after 6 months of walking. He gets walked around the block every day. He was a rescue but we think he is a 10 yo chihuahua mix. Also I swear he is happy! He just looks grumpy!,38412,aww
Aww! Good job, both of you- Buddy for getting in shape and you for being a good human being! ❤,4709,aww
r/progresspics needs this,1678,aww
I think you did a wonderful thing and I'm certain you've enriched his life and his mental health and that both he and the old lady you help love you dearly for it. The photos make me laugh though because in the second one, his squint makes he look like he is glaring into your soul with resentment. It's like he's thinking *'I was happy before you. Fat and happy. I stayed indoors where it was warm and my lily white feet knew only the soft embrace of the finest Persian rugs. But then . . . you came. Now I am ripped daily from my happy home and with my ever shrinking body I feel the bite of autumn's cold teeth. My feet are dirtied, dirtied by the harsh tap tap tap on concrete and the decaying bodies of once green leaves. As green and full of the warm sun's promise as my past was. One day I'll make you'll see. One day.'*,7475,aww
In the first pic he looks timid but now he has that smug ass look on his face like "yea, I look good." Too cute!!! You are a nice person!,413,aww
Is there a sub for doggo progress pics?,733,aww
From the look on his face, Buddy doesn't look enthused about his new fitness regimen.,189,aww
If you cut his nails, he will have a lot more of an easier time to be active and stay active. He will also feel a lot more comfortable in general.,172,aww
That’s awesome! Your neighbor might also consider feeding Buddy less, which will help him stay at a healthy weight.,943,aww
I love this so much. Thank you.,50,aww
Shameless plug here but I am in Atlantic Canada and volunteer for an organization called Elderdog. They pair seniors who have dogs with volunteers who walk them and play with them. I walk 2, sometimes 3, gorgeous dogs for a senior. If you live in At.Can, or even if you don't, look into organisations near you who may also do this. It's so rewarding and keeps seniors with their dogs longer.,46,aww
Buddy has made some great dogress!,70,aww
🎶 My Buddy and me! 🎶,67,aww
In the first picture he looks self conscious and in the second one he looks all smug like ay I know I look good beeee,35,aww

This is too awesome! You’re a great person!,16,aww
He looks like he’s sick of your shit,17,aww
That is awesome of you to help both of them!,13,aww

Fat pets like that break my heart. That is abuse!,32,aww
The sad thing is that this is a form abuse even though unintentional due to the elderly owner not being able to walk, but there needs to be volunteer services for those animals.  If the elderly owner can't take care of himself then how the hell are they going to take care of a dog or cat if they can't even get out of the front door.  The sad thing is if the animal is taken away, the elderly owner will most be heartbroken since the dog or cat is their only companionship.,20,aww
I'm glad you did it but honestly, the owner is to blame regardless of her age. She could have had someone all these years walk her dog.,34,aww
Before Pic: "Get the fuck away with that leash.  I'm not going.  I hate you."After Pic: "You're still a dick... but thanks for saving my life.",3,aww

Thank you so much for helping this dog out. You make a huge diffrerence on his quality of life.,3,aww
Probably saved this dog’s life!,3,aww

Buddy does not look amused.,3,aww

Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(,3,aww
Nice,3,aww

Chonk to chad,3,aww
Good job OP in helping the dog out. You probably saved its life.Having said that, it actually really annoys me when old people insist on continuing to own dogs, when they clearly aren't able to look after them properly. Failing to have a dog walked is failing as a dog owner. Also that little dog was morbidly obese, which again indicates that the 90 year old owner was completely failing in their duty.I appreciate that old people can get lonely, and want company in the form of a pet, but this situation was still unacceptable. My advice to such dog owners, is to either get help if they're struggling, or consider being owned by a cat. Either way, they need to take responsibility, or not own a pet at all. /rant,11,aww
People really shouldn't get pets when they're so old. It's not fair on the pets when they die and they get neglected in certain ways like this ): I'm happy you've helped her out like this though ! So kind,41,aww
This warms my heart.,5,aww
could be a sign of dementia or even alzheimers. my grandmother came to live with me and she kept over feeding my dog because he would beg for food and she could not remember he had already eaten. thankfully my little guy likes to chase other dogs along the fence so he ran the extra food off.,5,aww
Jesus that poor dog thank you for helping him,4,aww
That's animal abuse. If you can't take care of your pet, give it away.,9,aww
You are awesome, your neighbor is a dog abuser. Just feeding him less would also make him not morbidly obese. I get being super old sucks, but this is animal cruelty.,55,aww
Looks like a dog that barks at everyone and everything,4,aww
That's animal cruelty. If you can't care for an animal, find a new home for it, where it can be much happier. "Years" is more than enough time to hire a dog walker.,5,aww
Can you walk me, please? Thanks.,2,aww
You are beautiful soul!,2,aww

I'm sure he is happy to be outside but his better years are behind him inside of the house.,2,aww
God bless you,2,aww
Bet he is loving it too! Good for you, that's very kind of you.,2,aww
You have given Buddy so many more years!! Hopefully he will live at least as long as your neighbor... by the time people get that old they end up losing people, pets etc all the time. Hopefully this is one less loss they will have to experience!!,2,aww
Steph didn’t strike out this time. Steph hit a home run.,2,aww
You gave them both a gift. The dog gets weight loss, and the owner gets to keep her dog longer.,2,aww
You are so awesome helping out your senior neighbor and Buddy!,2,aww
Thank you for being a good person ❤️,2,aww

Love the expression on the after picture. Before: I'm fat, but I'm fine.After: I fuckin' hate you Bob.,2,aww
I used to walk my exes dog daily who is a corgi. Recently saw said dog and just about cried on how much weight she gained. Good on you OP for giving this pup some exercise!,2,aww

I've done that. Lots of elderly people in this neighborhood so I've walked their dogs.One pair of dogs I walked for three years. Really sad when they moved away. And now no one walks those dogs.,2,aww
Delivered pizza for a living. Can confirm a lot of old people have an overweight pupper to greet you at the door.,2,aww
He looks more miserable..,2,aww
All good things considered, the after image looks like hes seriously gotten sick of your shit.,2,aww
Sweet of you to help out.,2,aww
Yeah, he looks thrilled.,2,aww
Poor old lady and doggo. His mommy doesn't have the strength to walk him,2,aww
Well done! You have a generous heart, to do this for Buddy and your neighbor.,2,aww
You know she added you to her will ......your getting the dog <3,2,aww
He looks pissed about it. “God damn, picking me up and taking me from my house can’t believe this shi- I’m out OF BREATH MELANIE OK”,2,aww
Congrats to you and the dog. Looks like you both have had quite the transformations lately!,2,aww
Buddy looks like a real chick magnet :),2,aww
well done! Other people may see it and turn a blind eye to it but you chose not to ignore it. My dad was 86 years old and he had neighbors who always looked out for him and it really give me peace of mind that they did I didn't live very far away and neither did my sister's so we were there often but we knew when we couldn't make it like an inclement weather that he could count on them to help him maybe shovel his driveway or you know just things like that for him and it made all the difference in the world,2,aww
Can you take me for walks too, i need to lose weight 😂😂😂,2,aww
Good lad. He's looking in great shape. Can't believe just how round he was before.,2,aww
You ROCK!,2,aww
He’s not your buddy, pal.,2,aww
\>that expression in the second picture  You know he knows he's better and healthier, but he doesnt' like it and want you to know it,2,aww
#TransfomarionTuesdayGood job!,2,aww
I hope to have before and after photos like these,2,aww
Exactly what I was expecting to see owned by a 90 year old lady.,2,aww
Everyone should create an alt account to upvote this twice,2,aww
No doubt both Buddy and his mama are happy to have you as a neighbor. He looks so much better!,2,aww
Skinny boi,2,aww
It might not seem like much but this favor has more impact than you might realize...You are keeping an elderly person’s companion healthy, happy and alive. It’s proven that elderly people can live longer and are happier when they have a beloved pet. She is probably so relieved that he gets exercise and I bet she enjoys seeing you too. It’s always great to take initiative and do a kind deed but you have taken this a step further.  You saw a simple way that you could help and committed to it! By doing so you’ve improved someone else’s (lady and dog’s) quality of life!,2,aww
The second photo looks like Buddy's slowly realizing something about you. Like he was thinking about how much easier his life's been lately - being able to walk better, run again, and even jump onto the couch. And he thinks "Wait a minute, did this human teach me how to do these things again? Before I met her I'm sure I couldn't move so fast. It was you, wasn't it? My legs are better because of you, you sly dog.",2,aww
What breed is that? It looks like a house elf.,2,aww
since when did dogs master angling pictures?,2,aww
The dog has the I rather be fat face,2,aww
You're doing a great thing.,2,aww
Love it! You're a good hooman,2,aww
Hes makin nore progress than me. Good job lil buddy,2,aww
That is so fucking nice of you. That's what's living is all about Helping those ones who can't do it. This makes me happy good job buddy!!!,2,aww
Aww I hope you tell your neighbor that the internet loves her and her doggo!,2,aww
He looks very polite in the one to the left.,2,aww
I see two tails on the first photo. What happened to that one?,2,aww
100k in 5 hours?! Holy shit.,2,aww
Gj, but in some other states the police would have taken care of the issue by taking the dog from her.,2,aww
i love you. you are a hero to me.,2,aww
You're telling me getting out and moving made that dog lose weight?  I figured it needed a miracle product like fit tea or herbal life...,2,aww
From thicc to slicc.,2,aww
😭😭 poor doggie,2,aww
This is so pure!,2,aww
You’re a good person,2,aww
Ok..time to start taking myself for walks and lose some of these extra lbs.Thanks for the inspiration Buddy!,2,aww
This is lovely - you are a good human being! The idea of carrying Buddy partway and making him walk back is a great idea! Well done both!,2,aww
We adopted a dog named Buddy when his human had to enter an assisted living facility.  He too was overweight and clumsy, but he's a new man these days.  Fit and agile and just the sweetest little guy.  He loves his new pack.,2,aww
He looks very unamused at his progress,2,aww
Hey man, can you walk me? I got 15 pounds I would like to lose.,2,aww
Maybe added years to OP's life too.  Win, win.  Great Job!,2,aww
Yeah he totally looks thrilled about it.,2,aww
Such a wonderful thing you’ve done, both for the pup  and your neighbor.  I’ve done Meals on Wheels for years and there are so many elderly who are isolated. Sometimes the people who  are delivering meals might be the only people they see all week.  There so much kindness in what you’re doing.  Thanks for being a part of this world.,2,aww
Buddy does not look amused.,2,aww
From CHONK to HONK,2,aww
Jeez all that weight after 1 walk? You're a miracle worker,2,aww
Walking the dog and enriching his life is fantastic. Doing this for your neighbor, makes you an amazing human being! Way to be an awesome neighbor that I would be happy to live next to. Kudos!,2,aww

You are a great person! Xoxo,2,aww
Right on OP! Super nice for your to do for the dog and your neighbor.,2,aww
May I be next?,2,aww
I would love this arrangement.  I get a dog to walk but I don't have to be home by a certain time to let him/her out to pee :-),2,aww
That's absolutely adorable,2,aww
I wonder if he saved his skinny jeans,2,aww
Dude, nice.  I can definitely see those jaw gains and the lats are doing well too.  What body fat percentage is your dog?  Also, how much does he bench?  I'm trying to achieve that same ripped physique.  Can you also provide a diet plan?  Thank you so much.,2,aww
Buddy doesn't looked too thrilled!,2,aww
Thanks for helping out. I had to take a dog from a senior who could no longer care for their dog. She weighed 26 lbs. She lost 6.lbs and fits in with my other three dogs. She is now loving and happy. It makes me happy whenever I look at her. You’ll benefit from your efforts.,2,aww
Can you walk me?,2,aww
Buddy looks like he’s seen some shit,2,aww
This is so amazing!Congrats!/r/HumansBeingBros,2,aww
Aw, he looks fantastic! You’re a good person for doing this. My Nan is 76 and my brother walks her dog three times a week. The vets are pleased with her weight loss and the movement helps her tired old bones, plus she gets out of the house for half an hour to smell all the smells. I’m so glad there are good people out there to help animals.,2,aww
Are these nails supposed to be cut?,2,aww
Thank you for loving animals 🐢❤️,2,aww
You’re a good person. I salute you,2,aww

Do you also walk the bunnies in your avi?  I know someone w a rabbit named Kevin and I’m still not over it.  Like, I think ab Kevin the rabbit at least 4x  a week,2,aww
Buddy looks tired of your shit. Or maybe he's just tired.,2,aww

Neighbours have a golden. She's old and adorable and I've never seen her be walked in the year we've lived in this house. I want to so badly to offer to walk her! They've got kids at an appropriate age to walk her too. She's always running across the street to the field and wants to play. It breaks my heart.,2,aww
How nice!,2,aww
Well done.,2,aww
Hi Buddy. You are sooo handsome. Congrats on your weight loss. I just fell in love with a guy named Buddy.,2,aww

You are doing god's job, son,2,aww
He did look happier when fat tho. Or maybe you walked him too early on the morning.,2,aww
I used to have a Chihuahua that really loved it when we would take her out for walks but hated actually walking because she would get tired because she was incredibly fat, and she wouldn't lose weight. She passed away because some stomach problems caused by her love for food that was meant for a way bigger dog we had and depression by being separated 😅,2,aww
This has got to be the most wonderful short story I've read today. Thank you for this, OP. Buddy, in his second pic, looks like he doesn't want to participate in everything you put him through, but I'm sure he's happy. Such a cute dog! p.s. Have his owner cut his nails.,2,aww
Don't use this word lightly, but true Hero.,2,aww
Awww look at the little sausage,2,aww
Buddy looked like a giant tick w/ four legs but now looks so much healthier.,2,aww
Good hooman and pupper,2,aww
Kudos....I think you did a really kind act that was giving both to your neighbor and the little doggie. I wish my neighbors were so nice!,2,aww
He doesn't look so happy about it ...,2,aww
I wish someone made me go for walks lol,2,aww
That dog doesn't look happy about the diet :D,2,aww
Thank you for stepping up!! <3,2,aww
Thank you for doing a kind deed today ❤️,2,aww
🎶I’m too sexy for this leash!🎶,2,aww
My dog loves human scraps and gets into the cats food all the time, I think the only reason she's a skinny bitch is because I walk her excessively, but where as that works for her it has not worked for me, lol dog metabolisms are next level.,2,aww
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.&#x200B;&#x200B;,2,aww
I read it like “she hasn’t walked the dog in 90 years” 😂😂,2,aww
/r/dogresspics if you want even more looted karma,2,aww
You are a supreme human being!,2,aww
#THIS MAKES ME SO FUCKING HAPPY,2,aww
You are the bestest good grrl person ever!!,2,aww
Hey can you help me next?,2,aww
I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but this is one of the reasons old people shouldn't have pets that they can't fully take care off themselves,5,aww
Are you sure it wasn't just a big ugly domesticated rat?,5,aww
What an asshole if you can’t walk your poor dog have someone do it for you that’s not fair for buddy :(,5,aww
r/progresspics,3,aww
From R O U N D  B O I to L E A N  B O I.,4,aww
Thats one fat sumbitch,7,aww
That is why old people should not have young dogs, they should have like a parrot or a cat,12,aww
so you're saying that a little activity goes a long way? That can't be. Weight loss is more than eating less and moving more! That dog has outstanding genes! Or maybe the dog is doing keto and intermittent fasting. Do you add apple cider vinegar into the dog's water to melt the fat off? Is the dog following an organic, clean diet? How long it took you to detox the dog? /s,13,aww
He's not fat. Just big boned,3,aww
I know that it’s terrible for their health but fat animals are cute af,5,aww
Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(,3,aww
On the left: happy and chubby On the right: "it's 95° out Steph where are my dammed biscuits?!",3,aww
Thank you! From all the dog lovers in the world, especially the dog lovers that need extra help to keep our pups healthy.,2,aww
/r/dogresspics,2,aww
Wow, awesome. This is great. Taking care of elders and animals. Good for you, OP. My faith in humanity has increased in ratings.,2,aww
That dog looks 90 years old,2,aww
This works for humans too....get off your ass and move more if your overweight,2,aww
Holy fuck that dog looks like a snake after a huge mealI have one similar to it but she refused to walk on the leash so she just collects mass, pretty soon we're gonna start to orbit her :(,2,aww
Heckn good looking,2,aww
I hate to write it, but...she really should think of allowing you to adopt her dog.  She can't help her dog be healthy anymore, it's time to give him to someone that can.,2,aww
You shouldn't own a fucking dog if you refuse to walk it, really is sad when people abuse their pets like this, being old isn't an excuse either, you can get a mobility scooter and have him walk along side...,2,aww
You saved life of this dog. Lool at him and his over weight. You give him more years for live. Im so proud on you. Thanks for saving dog. Who have this dog is 100% no lifer or he does not have heart for animals. Dog is so polite. He does not seen nature many years.,2,aww
Are you positive his name isn't [Ferdinand](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tomandjerry/images/c/cf/Tom_and_Jerry_The_Movie_-_Ferdinand_holding_Jerry.png/revision/latest?cb=20150414015354)?,1,aww

Aww buddy looks great and so much happier! Thank you for sharing this. This is the kind of stuff we need more of!,1,aww
We're proud of you! Buddy,1,aww
Also - I like how in photo 1 - Buddy’s tail is in front of him but also TRAILS OFF BEHIND HIM. Honestly - there is some sci-fi shit going on with this dog. Side note - Good work OP. He looks awesome.,1,aww
Well done!,1,aww
Why is he giving you the stink eye?,1,aww

Such an awesome person you are to help that sweet little pupper and their hooman!!,1,aww
Your dogs must be pumped about his existence. "Look, there goes Buddy on a walk with OUR hooman.",1,aww
This is hysterical. There is a woman that just moved on my block who also had a horribly obese dog named buddy, also owned by her mom who couldn't walk him. I get to watch his weight loss each walk. I should have thought of a before/after photo, because man is that one MASSIVE dog.,1,aww
Is it just me or is he giving us the look at my new sexy body look on the right pic?,1,aww
I'd crosspost this on /r/loseit ;),1,aww
So nice of you!!!!,1,aww
This is a transformation story I can get behind lol way to go Buddy !!!,1,aww
That's awesome of you!,1,aww
Adorable,1,aww
Go Buddy Go! 👏,1,aww
 I read that as 90yo dog at first. But that’s awesome, I’m sure he’s much more comfortable with some of that weight off him. Such a cute pup!,1,aww
Good job buddy!,1,aww

Great positive influence in the world!!,1,aww

He doesn't seem very proud though.,1,aww
Before he was an absolute unit. Now hes just a lil chub.,1,aww
This is the best post I have seen on Reddit this week, thank you OP for being a brilliant human being,1,aww
No one else noticing the dog giving him the stink eye? He's like "why did you make me do this, I'm now gonna freeze to death cus i have no hibernation flubber",1,aww

Dog's are awesome. Life is simple for them, and caring for them reminds me of the simplicities in life we take for granted.,1,aww
 long nails!,1,aww
Also I'm sure the neighbor appreciates having some one stop by so that it something happens some one can at least call for help.,1,aww
You're so awesome! You're helping both doggo & human ( both you & the dog owner)😁,1,aww
He’s looks like he hates you for it. Good job helping him out!,1,aww
Needs more spray tan in second pic,1,aww
Can you take me out for a walk from time to time?,1,aww
Buddy aged.,1,aww
Awww, little guy was plump as a pickle,1,aww
Brøthêr may ī havæ the lööps,1,aww
He looked happier while he was fat,1,aww
haha he looks pissed you got him off his ass. I wonder if a pampered fat dog really cares if they’re fat, not like they’re getting laid.,1,aww
How old is he?,1,aww
Thank you so much for this, you have extended Buddy's life and made it a happier one too.,1,aww
you are a Super Hero!!! yay!,1,aww
She reminds me of my little Micah Sue. I got her from my mil and she was SO fat! She lost a bunch of weight,but she remained chunky until she passed. She was the friendliest dog ever and I miss her sweetness so much,1,aww
You look great Buddy,1,aww
U rock,1,aww
The dog looks sick wtf Did you do to it?,1,aww
Must've been a long walk!,1,aww

My 40yo able-bodied neighbor with an even more able-bodied teenage son hasn’t mowed their lawn in years, come mow their grass!,1,aww
OP, you are Awesome.,1,aww
Coincidentally, i also have a small dog named Buddy, but he loves walking; It's our other female small dog that is lazy and fatter,1,aww
You are amazing for doing that.  It makes such a difference in their lives.One thing though, if he is gaining weight without being walked, he is eating too many calories.  Advise the owner to check with their vet on how many calories he needs at a resting rate.  From there the vet can advise on how much food when walking.  Also no treating outside those calories.,1,aww
Is your neighbor dog actually buddy? I'm just asking cause back when I was a kid my first dog I named buddy as well 🤣Miss that good lazy boy,1,aww
Snoop Dogg, is that you?,1,aww
Go buddy!,1,aww
I need more people like you in my life. People who care about others.,1,aww
Consider that dog yours.,1,aww
Wow! He looks great! Awesome job!,1,aww
Amazing! I tried crossposting this to r/progresspics for a little bit of fun (crediting you and this post of course), but their stipulations made it difficult (title must be in format "F or M/age/height/200lbs > 140lbs = 60lbs Weight loss progress." Anyway, if you can figure all that out it might be some easy karma!,1,aww
Poor dog,1,aww
Buddy’s face doesn’t look like he enjoyed the weight loss,1,aww
😇😇😇,1,aww
Wow dude, that's really considering of you. Buddy's looking great!,1,aww
Aww what a goooooood booooooy he loves u sm now!!!,1,aww
Great job Buddy and To You for your dedication and selflessness!!! We need good stories like these:-)^_^,1,aww

You’re good people,1,aww
He looks the same,1,aww
When my old roommate and I moved into together, I started walking his elderly dog, which I don’t think had happened in years.  This dog went through a crazy transformation.  He wasn’t fat to begin with, but he did build some impressive muscle.  It was the happiest I’d ever seen him.  Even when he was inside he was more active— he didn’t just sit around anymore.  Cocoa died 3 months after I moved out.,1,aww
Nice bro.,1,aww
You are a good person.,1,aww
I love that you carried him out.  I knew people who had a dog who wouldn't want to walk out but would walk home, so they used a baby stroller to get him to the walk point. He sat so nicely in it and it was canopied so you wouldn't know a dog was in there instead of a baby until you got close. Surprise!,1,aww
Herbert?,1,aww
He even looks like he's smiling again. At least as much as a feisty chihuahua would. :)Well done, OP.,1,aww

Oh I guess Buddy loves his new body :),1,aww
I believe this is what you call a certified good boy,1,aww
Thank you being a wonderful person.,1,aww
I have a two year old rescue who is terrified of the leash-erupts into shakes when I even take it out.  Have tried just about everything-and she’s getting fat because I can’t figure out how to walk her.  We went to a trainer who suggested giving her treats while wearing the leash, putting her leash near her food, etc but she still hates it.  Any advice would be appreciated!,1,aww
Good person you are.,1,aww
You are an angel!,1,aww

My Daughter and son in law got a Australian Shepherd puppy. They both work, so I go over Monday through Friday and train and walk her@ 3  /  1/2 yr old pup. Can do these things : sit, stay, heel, shake both paws, lay down, roll over, crawl, come when called and she will lay down off to my side while I get her food and I place her food bowl down and she sits until I say go eat. Train them young, they’re like sponges.Great job on the weight loss on that older dog.Keeping an older dog fit is extremely important! What you did will make the dog healthy, but also getting more time with his best friend.I’m over doing my message, but that’s what dog lovers do!!,1,aww

His expression though in the one where he's on the leash says he hates you,1,aww
You don’t necessarily have to walk a dog to keep its weight in check.  It’s all about proper amount of food to feed.  Either way, good on you for making him healthier.,1,aww
How long between pictures? And that's an amazing thing you did 😀,1,aww

I hope your neighbour's doing ok, seeing as she hasn't took her dog for a walk in a while.,1,aww
Nice,1,aww
That's so kind of you :) Heartwarming to see how much healthier he is, he looks like a very sweet dog ♡,1,aww
That dog looks like it went through a tour in Vietnam in the second picture.,1,aww
nice job bro,1,aww
Lose up to 30 pounds WITHOUT dieting - you’ll NEVER believe what she looks like now,1,aww
this is the cutest ever<3,1,aww
Buddy went from Meme to Lean.,1,aww
He doesn't look any happier,1,aww
Where is the progress flair,1,aww
Why does he look like he’s about to cry.,1,aww
You have a big heart,1,aww
Good on you OP! Keep being an excellent person.,1,aww
Dude you are a good human!,1,aww
God bless you, the old lady, and her dog.,1,aww
A good caption goes a long way.,1,aww
This makes me very happy.  Best thing ive seen on the internet today. thanks!,1,aww
Lol, I love the dogs look after the weight loss. It's that, "I see what you tricked me in to" look.,1,aww
If he isn't an absolute unit anymore, does that make him a /r/relativeunit?,1,aww
lol the dog is looking at you like imma kill you in your sleep,1,aww
Wow!!! Great job. 👍🏼,1,aww
what an absolute unit!,1,aww
A buddy named Buddy. Well put,1,aww
Good for you! He looks bitter about it though haha,1,aww
Great job op,1,aww
Great work ! 1000 karma-points,1,aww
That lad is an absolute unit,1,aww
Awesome job on saving the dog (and owner) from a premature pup death. The dog is very cute super fat. Something about overweight animals charms the pants off me. They can't(shouldn't be) overweight, but when they are it's sadorable.,1,aww
His fur even got a tan! Haha! Nice job!!!,1,aww
After he should be able to walk u..😁,1,aww
Now you inherit a dog,1,aww
This is from the bottom of my heart guys. I really don't get how so many people are moved (me included) by this dog probably gaining a few years, but eat pigs and other virtually similar beings and 3 meals a day,1,aww
The dog might out live the owner now,1,aww
OMG IM SO PROUD OF BUDDY,1,aww
Good for Buddy!!!,1,aww
ProgressPics,1,aww
Faith in humanity restored,1,aww
He probably feels like a new man!,1,aww
God bless you,1,aww
You have done something amazing my friend God Bless you,1,aww
he looks like he's having a meltdown in the second picture, unfortunately.,1,aww
Thank you for looking out for your elderly neighbor. I’m sure it means so much to her.,1,aww
Those are happyboy eyes, kudos op,1,aww
what a fuckin' cutie!,1,aww
Wow what a good person you are. I hope good things come your way.,1,aww
Either fake or a girl needing attention for a good deed,1,aww
He needs a pair of sunnies,1,aww
Aww..little buddy is doing great! So cute..love this.,1,aww
MOOD!,1,aww
I can’t tell you how happy this makes me. I always feel sorry for dogs being loved to death.,1,aww
In awe at the size of this lad...,1,aww
Buddy looks like an arsehole,1,aww
Pic on the right looks like he wants to die,1,aww
So awesome that you did this!!! It’s not often enough that people in my generation(‘86) do things like this. It seems like most younger people cannot be bothered to help or even interact with the people around them. Great job helping him out!,1,aww
That is a lot of karma,1,aww
Share it in /progresspics,1,aww
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this but you not only helped him out physically but mentally as well. Dog's need to be walked. There is no activity that can replace that. Just letting them in the back yard is not the same mentally as walking is. Granted Buddy is old and doesn't need much anymore but for younger dogs this can be detrimental to their development.In Buddy's case, this small bit of exercise probably made him feel more "dog" that he has in a while and I bet he is more active around the house and not just sitting there like a sausage.Good on you. Now just get those nails clipped!,1,aww
Want to post this to /r/prawwgresspics too? That sub could use some love.,1,aww
You are a wonderful person! How did you approach the subject?,1,aww
You are amazing!!,1,aww
You are doing a wonderful thing for both the neighbor, and the dog. She has someone checking in on her regularly, and the dog gets some fresh air and sunshine. Plus, Buddy probably feels much better than he did before.,1,aww
My dog was named buddy,1,aww
What if the dog liked being able to roll around?,1,aww
I have the same carpet,1,aww
Big unit to healthy unit,1,aww
She probably fed him once every second day,1,aww
whoag,1,aww
One simple act of kindness and you gave that dog its life back and brought happiness to a senior citizen. One simple act of kindness can change so much.,1,aww
That was one thicc dog,1,aww
your doing gods work,1,aww
Awwwww,1,aww
is this loss,1,aww
Very good job! Movement is so Important for him,1,aww
Such a cute weight loss story, so nice of you to help out! Although, I have to admit I'm kind of jealous of Buddy, I want someone to successfully convince me to exercise!,1,aww
r/fitness and r/brogress,1,aww
This is truly a long game for karma, and it paid off...for you and the doge.,1,aww

Good for you and for Buddy!,1,aww
He looks depressed now,1,aww
I'd give you gold if I could my friend !,1,aww
Jesus christ, the poor thing...,1,aww
This is incredible. That dog's quality of life just shot up thanks to you.,1,aww
What breed is he?,1,aww
I wish I could marry a girl like you OP,1,aww
It’s hard being 90,1,aww

You're a great human! This fills me with joy. (:,1,aww
#ketolife lol,1,aww
You’ve done good. Society Thanks you.,1,aww
This is the most wholesome post I’ve ever seen on reddit. I love old dogs!,1,aww
How old is he?,1,aww
Where did he go to use the bathroom before that?,1,aww
This is awesome. Good on you.,1,aww
I lol'ed then I felt bad then i loled again.,1,aww
My mom needs to do the same thing,1,aww
That musta been a LOT of poop!,1,aww
Buddy looks absolutely disgusted with you,1,aww
That's so sad! I'm glad you are doing the good deed! So awesome!,1,aww
This is amazing, heck yeah op you probably gave him a few more years of life and  it probably makes his owner so happy.,1,aww
He's one skinny boi now,1,aww
You are fucking awesome 👌,1,aww
Haha such a fat cute doggy,1,aww
Thank you so much for doing this, you are wonderful person.  How much did he weigh when you started and how much does he weigh now?  Give the good boy some green beans (amazing "treat" for weight loss, canned pumpkin too) from me!,1,aww
So wonderful!!  What a great person you are!! ❤️,1,aww
I'm sorry if someone already asked, but how long did this take?,1,aww
Awesome,1,aww
This is so sweet, the world needs more of you OP!,1,aww
Buddy has Yoda ears,1,aww
Is it just me or does the after picture make the dog look like he is really pissed?,1,aww
Can you stop by and walk me too... I am in big need!!,1,aww
Such a nice thing to do,1,aww
Kind of off topic, but how do I convince my mom to buy real dog food for our dog? I'm getting worried because I know breaded chicken patties can NOT be good for him.,1,aww
He looks tired,1,aww
Lol what a fat bastard. I actually like the old pic more,1,aww
That’s awesome,1,aww
I love you for this.,1,aww
What a good boy,1,aww
That second pic is the look of satisfaction, if I ever.,1,aww
It looks like there is another dog in the first picture, what happened to that one?,1,aww
I see the tail of another dog! What about that one!?,1,aww
My 85 year old grandparents had a dog named Buddy that died from complications of diabetes. I remember when I was younger I was doing yard work for them as a part time job and my grandmother would make me lunch. One day I went in to see a sandwich and she was cooking bacon. I was pumped and was like "oh I love bacon on my sandwiches." To which she responded "Oh... I can make more, this bacon is for Buddy." The poor dog was basically a round table near the end.,1,aww
That dog hates you.,1,aww
aww such a good heart,1,aww
thank you for taking the time :),1,aww
What a good pupper,1,aww
Wow! That is so awesome!! 🙂,1,aww
Buddy looks like he is sick of your bullshit.JK: you are a good neighbor,1,aww
What a great transformation!! Goes to show that it starts with a simple walk,1,aww
Dog: ( he-help me.),1,aww
Thank you for being a good human,1,aww
How long was this transformation?,1,aww
that’s awesome. my grandma lived alone in her latter years and was unable to walk her dog buddy. fortunately there was a young neighbor fella who would do it for her. they actually became friends and would watch baseball games together.,1,aww
Put this on r/loseit!,1,aww
You've done this fellow a good service!,1,aww
You are so cute!,1,aww
Wow, you’re a saint. Unfortunately some old folks end up “accidentally” neglecting their pets. Thanks for paying attention and stepping up for the little guy. That made my day.,1,aww
Thank you very much for doing this,we need more people like you...proud of body,he is so cute!!,1,aww
You are an incredible person. Do you have your own Buddy? If not, get ready!,1,aww
Absolute unit,1,aww
Buddy looks pissed,1,aww
Buddy's eyes used to sparkle... diet is hard,1,aww

Excellent human being! This dog loves you so much for it.,1,aww

What is the furry thing on the left though?,1,aww
You’re awesome,1,aww

Crosspost this to r/progresspics,1,aww

It looks like he despises you though.,1,aww
Can you take me next?,1,aww
jesus poor guy. dogs need walks. not like human need dogs exist for walks, this dog wouldve been depressed as fuck.,1,aww
I used to know a dog named buddy, he too was pretty obese and old; the owner himself could barely walk most of the time, and the dog sadly died to some form of cancer afterwards ;(It hurt seeing a creature in so much pain.,1,aww
That’s sweet thank you for helping Buddy and your neighbor,1,aww
Love that the before photo is like “oh god don’t look at me”,1,aww
Thank you!,1,aww
It’s 4:33pm PST and this is the best thing I’ve seen all day.,1,aww

I gotta ask, how did you get him in there?,7638,aww
Spaghetti looks like a very civil serpent.,6770,aww
[removed],12441,aww
I wanna see that in action,5185,aww
Although he's cold blooded, he probably finds that it feels very safe and maybe the fuzziness feels good too.  He might find it a fun little hiding sleeve, or he might actually find it comfortable.  I think he's adorable!  Merry Christmas!,7155,aww
Spaghetti is a perfectly appropriate name for a danger noodle.,2369,aww
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready,10792,aww
Snekologist here. This is actually very bad for the snek. It instills an unrealistic fashion sense potentially causing fabulousness. The snek will demand more and more finely tailored garments until it enters a  state of being utterly and completely fabulous. By this time it's too late. The owner has gone bankrupt by now and the snek wears only Armani. The snek will Constantly demand that you get Armani on the phone.,1347,aww
Can he slither with it on? It looks like he would slide out.,990,aww
My cornsnake's name is Ziti!,1180,aww
Snuggly snek,1610,aww
Holy Crap!I didn't expect this post to blow up like it did. My sister just learned how to crochet about a month ago and she made me this for Spaghetti. Best gift ever!On behalf of Spaghetti, Thank you so much! And thanks again for the gold! Completely unexpected.Thank you! This made my Christmas!,809,aww

Ok... I hate snakes and that's the cutest damn thing I've ever seen. Bonus cute points for naming a snake Spaghetti.,126,aww
My noodles name is Spaghetti too! She's a girl though, and she doesn't have a sweater,108,aww
So cute, too bad sweaters don’t work on snakes ;) 🐍,505,aww
I hate snakes but this is so cute I can’t believe it.,109,aww
Science question: Do sweaters keep sneks warm? Since they’re cold blooded, do they generate enough heat (or any, but they must generate some heat I think...) to be warmed by a sweater?,19,aww
Lookssss like he apresssssssiatessss the nissssse insssssulation.,143,aww
Spaghetti’s stomach muscles might not be able to get traction with his new sweater. So he may be in full “Well, I guess this is my life now,” mode haha.,17,aww
If snakes had hair, this is how I imagine it would look like,20,aww
Dude, she just made the arm part.,22,aww
i think /r/snakes would appreciate this,9,aww
Would a sweater work for cold blooded animals? Would it be any warmer?,8,aww

The best time to wear a snake sweater... is all the time!,7,aww
Normally snakes scare the shit out of me but it's so hard to be afraid of a lil guy named spaghetti with big sparkling eyes wearing a sweater his aunt made himIt's the end of the world. I love this little guy. Give spaghetti a kiss on the head for me.,7,aww
How did you get it on him?,6,aww
Idk how you got that on him, I feel like if I tried to put a sweater on my corn snake she wouldn’t be too happy about it lol.,13,aww

I think Lowly Worm had a sweater like that.,4,aww
background on snake?,4,aww
I loathe snakes. But I ❤️seeing this snek in its sweater.,4,aww
Was it a total surprise? Did she contact you ahead of time and ask how long Sketti is? Or did she come over with a tape measure and you ask "what are you doing with mah snek?" And she said, "oh nothing..."I have a pretty bad fear of snakes. I'm working on it though. Your sweet baby is awfully cute in that sweater.,5,aww
Aww. Not aww, but a snake shat on me once while I was holding it. Sprayed bile-looking stuff and bits of bones all over me. Perhaps the sweater can double as a diaper?,4,aww
There’s a children’s book (it’s very old and maybe out of print) called Crictor. It’s about a boa constrictor whose owner knits him a sweater to wear just like this! It was one of my favorite books as a little girl and my daughter now loves it too :) Such a cute snake and sweater,3,aww
Good Snek.,4,aww
Idk what’s better...a snake named Spaghetti or a sweater made for a snake ❤️,4,aww
Nah not at all lol. It's more of a tube for him to just park in, it doesn't really effect him all that much, he slithers right out of it when he's bored,3,aww
Many of my family members were slaughtered by this beast, do not trust snek!,5,aww
If snakes are cold blooded. Is the sweater actually providing any utility for spaghetti? Isn’t the whole point of sweaters to trap body heat radiated form a persons own body?,5,aww
Hey everyone!I wanted to thank you so much for sending Spaghetti some love for Christmas, I can't believe how much this thing blew up. I ended up doing an interview with The Dodo this morning. Completely blew my mind. Thanks again, it's really been a fun ride.Here is a link to the interview if anyone wanted some backstory on Spaghetti and his sweater!https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/pet-corn-snake-gets-christmas-sweater,4,aww

I wanted a bunny rabbit, I was gonna name it Nathan... that's Latin for 'warm' by the way... Nathan Scott Phillips..,3,aww
Came here expecting Eminem lyrics. Was moderately dissapointed,3,aww
You get an upvote just for naming your snake “Spaghetti”,3,aww

whoathe video of this is #9 trending on youtube right now.i don't think i've seen an actual interesting minute-long video from a real-life person on the trending section in like 5 years. it's always filled with late night tv show host garbage, 25 minute vlogs by 30 year olds that are marketed to children, and an occasional rap video.Come with me and be awed by this.,3,aww
So not a turtleneck?,3,aww
He just crawls out of it on his own. It's not stuck to him (no arms to hold it on!),3,aww
Cute and eleguant,3,aww

For some reason I read this as my sister made a sweater out of spaghetti,5,aww
Now Spaghetti needs a light layer of cheese.,7,aww
A sweater won't do anything for a cold blooded animal. The only reason clothes make you warm is because you produce heat and the clothing traps that heat.,11,aww
His tail is sweaty, scales weak, charms are heavy.There's vomit on his sweater already, his name is spaghetti.,4,aww
Kevin Durant looks cute in this,13,aww
Aren't snakes coldblooded?,5,aww
I'm drunk rn so I'll be that one guy. Snakes don't really 'love' anything. They're next to mindless and only care about food, a place to hide and temperature regulation. They're pretty much neutral to everything else. My rosy boa acts like I'm nothing more than an object it's way.,10,aww
theres snek in his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti,6,aww

spaghetti = danger noodle,2,aww

Imagine the phone call between OP and their sister.Sister: *Hey how long is your pet snake?*OP: *uuuhhhh, 28 inches, why?*Sister: *No reason*,2,aww
Sorry to be 'that guy', but snakes are cold-blooded and thus do not produce their own body heat. Sweaters are made to insulate and keep body heat from escaping through the air. Since snakes do not do this in the first place, the sweater is probably a hopeless cause for reptilian comfort. Actually, the guy would probably be much happier under a warm lamp.But it's the thought that counts, right?,2,aww
"I knew I could pull off a *turtle*neck.",2,aww
I’m going to annoy everyone with this knowledge thank you.,2,aww
"Oh... wow a sweater. Terrific. Just... What a gift. Thank you. This will keep me warm, you know, because of all that *warm blood* in my fucking body.",2,aww
Rest in Spaghetti, never forgetti.,2,aww
I need science! For a Warm blooded animal it would help keep body heat in. Does the sweater do anything for the snake, who doesn't generate body heat?,2,aww
He's mom's spaghetti. <3,2,aww
Might be cause I am drunk but I picture you're snake screaming in a vegeta tone," women where is my fuzzy snake suit".,2,aww
His palms are sweaty,2,aww
I’m terrified of snakes, but even I have to say this is totally adorable lol spaghetti. that is a really cute name for a snake.,2,aww

My mom crochets draft snakes to block the cold coming inside. I'm gonna have to step extra high over that draft snake next time I visit, because I'll remember this picture. I hate snakes, but congratulations on a comfortable-seeming snake who I assume is very nice.,2,aww

serious question: how do sweaters affect snakes? like, does it keep them warm? or will it cause them to overheat in any way?,2,aww
Hey what are you knitting there? A sweater for my snake. What does it look like?But seriously would you consider making a video of Spaghetti putting on the sweater?And posting it of course!,2,aww
Finally... a scaly friend makes it to the front page on this subreddit :~),2,aww
Reminds me of a double reed on a bassoon or oboe.,2,aww
I don't like serpents, but Spags here looks like a good boy.,2,aww
Ugh! Again with people posting snakes that are kind of adorable. I have a phobia, stop confusing me!,2,aww
As someone who hates snakes, I can't believe how absolutely adorable this is.,2,aww
What is that? A turtleneck?,2,aww
It looks so cute !!!,2,aww
When your snake rocking a knit like that it ain't a "Spaghetti" it's a "**Swag**hetti",2,aww
Fuzzy danger noodle!,2,aww
Came for the sweater of spaghetti.  Left disappointed.,2,aww
Spaghetti. Thats fucking awesome,2,aww
Vacuum your floors once in a while holy moly,2,aww
Possibly the best name ever for a snake,2,aww
It's a tube top!,2,aww
Could she add more rows to make it longer, to cover his tail end? This is adorable 🐍,2,aww
I’d like to see the video of her putting him in that.,2,aww
r/sneks gave me a whole new perspective on snakesI use to see them as just creepy, but that sub showed me that they can have the personality of a puppy!,2,aww

Omg his name is Spaghetti. I love that❤️❤️,2,aww
More like a boa constricted amirite?,2,aww
Time to vacuum,2,aww
hate to break it to you, but unless that sweater has active heating, then the only benefit that snake will see is not losing any heat to the flooring and looking cute AF.,2,aww
For a second I thought "who the fuck names their snake Spaghetti?", then I looked at his face. Spaghetti looks comfy.,2,aww
I like that his name is Spaghetti,2,aww
This may be the only time a snake has been adorable. But instinct is telling me it’s a trap.,2,aww
Your name, is The Enforcer.I want my name to be Spaghetti.,2,aww
Hate to be that guy, but sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals. Sweaters just keep your body heat in, they dont produce heat themselves,2,aww

Are insulating garments helpful for keeping cold-blooded animals warm? Just wondering. Not trying to diminish your sister's thoughtful gift.,2,aww
no step on snek!,2,aww
I can’t decide what’s better. The fact that his name is Spaghetti or the fact that he has a sweater?,2,aww
I really wish people would stop putting sweaters and shit on their ectotherms. I mean its cute for a photo op or whatever but don't let it hand out like that, you're going to kill it.,2,aww

You named your cat spaghetti?,2,aww
I'd be surprised if you haven't seen this already, but I thought of you immediately when I saw this u/Androze,2,aww
Mom's Spaghetti.,2,aww
Here I am, 10,000 comments down, but I wanted you to know that your sweatered snek was mentioned in another post about the size of Amazon shipping boxes. I hope you read this in time because it is not too far down from this post in r/All. Spaghetti now has Internet fame. It doesn't get any better than that for a snek. Edit. Poster is u/Protanope.,2,aww
How are sneks as pets? I assume this is a very chill and friendly type? Sneks arent domesticated like dogs and cats, so just wondering,2,aww
r/sneks will love your comfy noodle,2,aww
What kind if dog is this?,2,aww
Nyeh heh heh! I approve!,2,aww

Aren‘t clothes useless for cold-blooded animals?,2,aww
That's not spaghetti that's a snake,2,aww
Snake in the sweater already, sisters spaghetti,2,aww
It is very nice and I know that reptiles love heat,  but I am not sure how effective a sweater is on a cold blooded animal that does not produce a large amount of heat.,2,aww
That's a personal protection scarf.,2,aww
So pure.*so pure...*,2,aww
Venom on his sweater already, moms spaghetti.,2,aww

Definitely moms spaghetti... “Don’t forget your sweater it’s cold outside.”,2,aww
well she should have made a vacuum, broom, and DUSTPAN,2,aww
Does a sweater work for a cold blooded critter?,2,aww
I'm loving the name spaghetti. For the first time ever it kinda makes a snake cute.,2,aww
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.,2,aww
Can he crawl with it on?,2,aww
2nd place of all time in 1 day... jeebus.,2,aww
Funny name!,2,aww
What a great fucking name for a snake.,2,aww
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!,2,aww
That looks constricting...,2,aww
How adorable!I've read some comments calling him  "Danger Noodle".Cool name for a band, eh??"Squirmy Sid and the Danger Noodles"Love him!,2,aww
My dad and I caught a king snake when we were out in the sticks, he let me hold it and slowly my grip behind it's head loosened enough so it could turn around and bite me.  My dad in turn said "well I guess we'll find out if it's actually a king snake or if it's a corral snake won't we" and laughed. Looking back I'm still not sure if he was kidding.,2,aww
RemindMe! 4 months,2,aww
if a danger noodle is in a sweater, that's called a snuggle noodle,2,aww
Happy constricting!,2,aww
snakes are cold blooded....,2,aww
How can you tell? Genuinely curious as I don't own a snake.,2,aww
I feel attached to spaghett...,2,aww

It is ironic that this will not raise his body temperature at all.,2,aww
To poop on.,2,aww
Missed opportunity to nickname him "Long John",2,aww
OMG that’s sooo adorable!!!,2,aww
Not sure how that works considering reptiles are cold blooded, but still pretty neat!,2,aww

I have to show this to my husband! We have 4 snakes he he!,5,aww
Turtleneck?! Interesting choice.,3,aww
Spaghett!,2,aww
Fuck snakes!,4,aww
Just wanna say that insulation on cold blooded animals is very unhealthy for them as it interferes with their body’s ability to absorb heat or cool off.,3,aww
He's a sleepo beepo,3,aww
Can someone make me a few of these? I have a 5ft corn snake, 2 3.5ft ball pythons, a 1ft hognose, and a 6ft boa constrictor. I'm in the UK and will happily pay. Also interested in a selection of snake and gecko sized hats.,2,aww
Never knew snakes can be pets !!! Moment of enlightenment. Are these comparable to Dogs and Cats? Still cannot get my head around. So confused right now. Sorry if I offended you in anyway. From where I come from we have been taught to be scared of them !!!,2,aww
Putting a sweater on a creature that needs to absorb heat from its environment seems counter productive.,2,aww
There’s vomit on his sweater already, name’s spaghetti.,2,aww
You guys realize hes cold blooded so its barely gonna warm him right :P,2,aww
But snakes don't produce their own body heat, so wouldn't this not work?,2,aww
Think about the animals in these kind of posts, you’re having a giggle about an animal’s discomfort.,2,aww

This is the best thing I’ve seen all day,1,aww
But Spaghetto can’t move while wearing it without just sliding out, right?,1,aww
Do you have a hamster named meatball too?,1,aww
Aren’t snakes cold blooded? Wouldn’t this fail to make him warm?,1,aww
He loves it until he wants to move around,1,aww
What happens if he tries to move? Does the sweater move with him or does he just slither out of it? It's gotta be the latter right - too much friction between the sweater and the carpet?,1,aww
This is pure love,1,aww
Ssssssssssspeghetti,1,aww
There's a snake inside the sweater already , named spaghetti,1,aww
Now Spaghetti has macaroni sweater,1,aww

How is he gonna crawl now,1,aww
Spaghetto*,1,aww
So sweet...,1,aww
My dogs name is also Spaghetti,1,aww
How would a sweater keep a cold blooded animal warm?,1,aww
Would this even make him warmer? Since he’s cold blooded isn’t his body temp the same as the ambient temp? So this wouldn’t make any difference.,1,aww
Thsts awesome! For some reason I don't mind a snake in a sweater.,1,aww
Is it your mom's?    ^^^^I ^^^^am ^^^^so ^^^^sorry.,1,aww
does clothing really help a cold-blooded animal? Honest question. I am sure they generate some heat, of course, but it enough for the sweater to be effective?,1,aww
I also could not resist naming one of my spaghettis “Spaghetti”. ;),1,aww
Quick question: is he able to move around and keep it on or is he only able to sit still? Cute lil noodle by the way :),1,aww
I didn't know that I needed to see a snake in a sweater.... But I'm so glad that I got to see Spaghetti in a sweater.,1,aww

Not so much snek sweater. More like snek overalls.,1,aww
I'm no biologist, but since an ectothermic animal (e.g a reptile) relies on absorbing heat from its environment to survive, wouldn't that mean insulation like a sweater would actually be much more of a hindrance to them?,1,aww
How would you possibly get him in there without pissing him off?,1,aww

Would a sweater actually keep him warm though? Reptiles don't generate body heat to be kept in. I suppose if the sweater itself is warm, the proximity would also keep him warm.,1,aww

Pretty sure sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals.Just saying... it kinda has the opposite effect right?,1,aww

Spaghetti mentioned on Reddit and almost 2000 comments later barely a lyric from Lose Yourself. That must be one adorable snake!,1,aww
I am always curious how people deal with large snake pets. What do you feed it every day? How do you deal with its poop? Unlike dogs and cats, they do not poop outside or in a specific place, right?,1,aww
Awesome!,1,aww
At what point does a snake decide you are not a meal?,1,aww
NOPE,1,aww
Other than being cute, would this actually do anything? Technically being cold blooded wouldn't this have a cooling effect rather than warming?,1,aww

I just want to know what type of snake this is? Corn snake?,1,aww
Thisss issss nicessss - snek probably,1,aww
I believe spaghetti isn’t a singular, so it should be “My sister made a sweater for Spaghetto”,1,aww
Thats not spaghetti, thats a snake.,1,aww
Jackets keep us warm by helping us trap in our own heat. I wonder if this sweater helps a cold blooded snake keep warm. Anyone know?,1,aww
I love it but... You know how a doctor tests the sensitivity of skin with one of two sharp points? Can a snake feel two points if both hit the same scale? Fuzzy may mean nothing to them. And since they don't make their own heat insulation may have little meaning.,1,aww
so really very cute >,.<,1,aww
Genuine question here( I don't know anything about snakes) - is this close contact with wool bad for Spagetti's skin?Cool foto OP, really an awww momentWaiting on your sister to knit a sweater for your pet Rancor too, OP!,1,aww

Honestly the best thing about this post is that you named your snake “spaghetti”,1,aww
Since reptiles are cold-blooded (they don't produce a steady body heat), does a sweater work to keep them warm?,1,aww
You made my wife squee. Good job!,1,aww
Wao looks so comfortable,1,aww
/u/LazarusRise Thoughts?,1,aww
This is the cutest picture of a snake, I've ever seen.,1,aww
Cute sweater, still a nope rope.,1,aww
What species of snake is this?,1,aww
That's one cozy nope rope,1,aww
Nope x×××××××××10 fuck that, glad u r warm dude...Fuck th!,1,aww
So..is spaghetti a fan of purple rain?,1,aww
He looks stiff as.. well a tube, can he move?,1,aww
I never thought snakes could be adorable, but this is actually adorable! I love him!,1,aww
The way it looks makes me wonder what would happen to a smol snek in a chinese finger trap.,1,aww
She totally deserves it !!,1,aww
I've never thought of snakes as adorable before. Cool, maybe, but this is a first for me. Awwwwwww :)Also, that name is a hilarious choice. 1000 points to whoever thought that up.,1,aww
Love the sweater, but upvote goes for calling him/her "Spagetti",1,aww
That name is so cute,1,aww
Sorry you mean noodle,1,aww
I’m pretty sure snakes are cold-blooded,1,aww
Snake,1,aww
Footsie,1,aww
That is amazing!,1,aww
Danger noodle.,1,aww
Haha, he's wearing a sweater but he can't sweat,1,aww
I wonder how often he slithers through the port of that subwoofer back there and takes naps.,1,aww
Excellent. Next year you need to sew him a little Santa hat.,1,aww
Happy snake. =),1,aww
Very nice,1,aww
What kind of snake is it ?,1,aww
Is it your mom’s pet?,1,aww

I'm a grown ass man sitting in bed helplessly giggling at the fact that you named your snake spaghetti,1,aww
My boyfriend and I were just discussing getting a snake and naming it 'Sketti.' I love your little nope noodle and his name. Also he looks super cozy <3,1,aww
Please Eminem, do a song with these alternative lyrics.,1,aww
Thats cute,1,aww
I'm Spaghetti the snake and I start with the letter ***sssssssssss***,1,aww
S N U G G L E L O N G B O Y E,1,aww
I’ve always wondered, do pet snakes feel/show love? Or do they just kinda chill there and not care about anything?,1,aww
Hey uh... You have cat's don't you? 🤔,1,aww
Is he trained to not bite you?,1,aww
Is it for real?,1,aww
How’d you get him in there?,1,aww
He crawls inside of it and just sits there. after awhile he works his way out. Its more of a cozy sleeping bag if you want to look at it that way. Its the principal!,1,aww
You think?? With a snake, can one ever be sure.,1,aww
wow.. just awesome,1,aww
Now snek is warm blooded :),1,aww
Probably already said but snakes are cold blooded, so would this do anything?,1,aww
Wow😍 cutieeee,1,aww
What an adorable danger noodle,1,aww
Must get cold feet,1,aww
It suits him down to the ground.,1,aww
COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
I love how the cat is just playing it off, like “alright whiskers, just act normal and pretend like you didn’t just pass through a glass table...”,4348,aww
That is hilarious.  But I am impressed, despite not expecting to fall that far, the cat handled the landing like a champ.,14517,aww
Your cat had a lot of confidence in that invisible table.,11992,aww
"I don't understand... Normally I levitate here. HAVE MY POWERS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME?!?",1938,aww
I used to have the same desk. Actually frequency in which it needed cleaning is why I got a new one hahaEdit: Apparently most of Reddit also owns/has owned this desk at one time or another.,2423,aww
TIL cats use the scientific method.,1186,aww
That is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen,416,aww
Lol after the jump the cat was like “wtf is going on lemme check if the table just vanished” then **tapping intensified** and “DAMMIT I KNEW IT”,794,aww
She's like "WTF DID YOU DO JERRY?! IT WAS JUST HERE!",1305,aww
The cat version of the classic [dog who thinks the glass door is closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2hmwn7/dog_stays_outside_because_he_thinks_the_terrace/).,105,aww
"What happened to the magical force  field that used to be here?",387,aww
Fuck yes, this gif was worth 187 MB on a 2M connection,243,aww
At the end he's touching it like "what the fuck is this witchcraft?",126,aww
180mb gif? Really?,151,aww
We did this once to our glass table but instead of jumping on the table, he ran full force into the glass that was leaning up against the wall.  The "Thunk" he made was incredible.,52,aww
Logitech Z5500?,31,aww
Still graceful AF,23,aww
It almost looks like she had a sense of humor about it. This is really cute.Edit: She, not he.,17,aww
I was incredibly confused by this at first...I have almost an identical desk, with an almost identical sub in the corner, with the same weight under the right side, with similar carpet under, and used to have that same keyboard.  If it wasn't for the wall color (which I really, really like by the way) and the cat (also adorable--I have two, but thankfully they aren't doppelgangers as well) I would have thought that I was looking at my own downstairs.,18,aww
I have this desk!!! The glass is so scratched and ugly after 3 years. I windex and windex and all I can think of are all the scratches. My cats fear it,16,aww
I wish I had a cat.I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.:(,28,aww
I'd love to know what they're thinking...,12,aww
It really amuses me to think that many animals must think they're levitating when they lay on glass. To them, the world is full of invisible walls that can disappear and reappear at any time.,14,aww
"ah, yes. Everything is ok.  I meant to do this." *rubs*,19,aww
Swear to god everyone in the world has this desk,11,aww
He's probably going crazy and contemplating his entire life thus far,9,aww
/r/catpranks,18,aww
Cats are strange and amazing creatures. One of mine is obsessed with the fish tank so much so I count the fish every morning make sure she didn't get one lol. Several times a day she will do a paw check just to make sure the glass is still there, because hey, who knows? Water might be holding itself in place this time.,7,aww
This should be on r/nonononoyes,17,aww
I did not expect it to jump up! That was awesome.,6,aww
I have the same desk.,5,aww
Me trying to score,5,aww
I wish I recovered like that,6,aww
your cat made my day bearable, thank u,6,aww
/r/youseeingthisshit,4,aww
What you don't realize is the cat knew that the glass was gone.  The cat was simply testing you to see if you understood its perception of reality.  Cats are always right.  Just realize, now, that when you put the glass top back on, the cat will jump *through* the glass.,4,aww
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?,5,aww
Hey what’s going on here?,4,aww
She can be silly sometimes.,3,aww
I’d score that dive a perfect 10.,4,aww
I know y'all rich fuckers with 100MB/s, but could we have gifs that do not weigh 187MB pls?,3,aww
Cat handled that jump like a fucking champion. That's a magical creature right there.,4,aww
188 MB for a 20 second gif? Fucker!,4,aww
Yo, I have that same desk. I love that desk. I did very similar thing cleaning it when I went to set down a smoothie , and it went right through.,4,aww

I have that keyboard. Logitech g15?,3,aww
Can someone add cat calculations to this?,3,aww
I want to see the cat's reaction when the glass top is put back on.,3,aww
We have the same desk.  And keyboard.. and speakers. What the hell, are you me?,3,aww
16.83  There's your trouble, homan person, the part that goes here is missing.,3,aww
cat goes straight to smelling as if that's going to identify the problem lol,3,aww
I feel like you can see a part of the cat's brain going HANG ON SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT before the jump but not managing to convince the rest of it to stop.,3,aww
It's kinda frustrating that I'll never be able to convey to that cat what's happening and it'll never know,3,aww
This cat is the Richard Feynman of cats, using her paw to create a model of the natural world for future reference (the no table where there is clear was a table not now theory of tables) and predictions. Of course scent marking the "phenomenon" with the side of her face and whiskers in case formal model fails at some point in the future.,3,aww
At least it was a 10/10 jump.,3,aww
You know how when you're going down the stairs and you think there's one less step than there is and for a split second you think "this is how I die"? Times that by a hundred and I bet that's what that cat just went through.,3,aww
I once spilled drinking water over my bed I had to take the mattress outside for drying.Came back to find my cat staring at an empty bed frame with devastating look, like it’s the end of the world for her.,3,aww
"What sourcery is this???",3,aww

Oh my. I just about peed my pants from laughing so hysterically. But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed with guilt for laughing at the poor helpless and confused feline! The wife and I always talk about our West Highland Terrier being a creature of habit. Well, I think the same applies here. Thanks for the video. I pray the cat recovers soon.,2,aww

Marvelous.  Did not stop its curiosity.  Delightful cat.,2,aww

Ah, is that a z5500 sub I spot there?I have two sets. Probably gonna sell one. Bought it from a guy used for $140 lol. Practically a steal if you ask me. I was running two subs using a cable I got from eBay. You learn to appreciate just how powerful that sub is after running two in unison and being overwhelmed lol.,2,aww

Your cat probably thinks it has super powers now and will try to run through a wall.,2,aww
Can you imagine the thoughts going through that cat's mind, thinking it would land on a table but instead "Oh shit! What! Where's the-",2,aww
At least your cat is still curious, some cats won't do anything but sleep.,2,aww

I had that exact same desk as my first desk, the first delivery had the short and the triangle pieces broken, the second attempt the triangle piece was see through and not black and it took like, 3 weeks for the final delivery with the black corner. Then I got disgustingly drunk one day and broke it :(,1,aww
I have the exact same desk. Now all I need is the exact same cat.,1,aww

So years ago I had a chinchilla called Perry. He was fucking adorable, he was like my best fuzzy little friend. He liked to sit either with or on us.He got so used to jumping on the foot stool we had that one night when my mum moved it he kept jumping up and trying to land on it even when it clearly wasn’t there, and he was so confused and determined that if he just jumped one more time he’d land on it as always. It’s one of the funniest and most adorable things I’ve ever seen an animal do, and this reminds me of that. Animals rock,1,aww
OMG, at 0:17, that's the first time I've ever seen a cat actively use its whiskers to feel for something it can't see before confirming with a paw.,1,aww

Was the top made of glass?,1,aww
I have that exact same desk. However, I moved into a tiny apartment so now I just use one pieces of it lol,1,aww
Dude 😂😂😂😂👏👏👏,1,aww
Do you live in Staple Hill?,1,aww
Reminds me of the first time my cat jumped up on the toilet seat only to find out that the lid wasn't down.,1,aww

I used to have the exact same desk.,1,aww
187MB gif? Ooooof,1,aww
Can you imagine being able to casually jump up to 3 times your height,1,aww
Random question but what's supporting that quarter circle piece? Looked connected on one side and not the other with no leg support. Yup I'm bored.,1,aww
Same desk :D,1,aww
Somethins fucky boys,1,aww
I love it, that could've gone so poorly but it didn't,1,aww
I had that desk. You don’t remove the glass for cleaning. Removing entire fingernails is less painful than the assembly of that desk.,1,aww
Is it because he’s dum or he can’t see glass ?,1,aww
LMAO awesome!,1,aww
Classic corner glass desk, got one myself.  My cat just decides to knock all my shit off it lol.,1,aww
This is the first post to make me genuinely laugh for a long time !,1,aww
Is that a g105 keyboard?,1,aww
You obviously did not consult the proper authority before starting your cleaning job.,1,aww
Stoopid cat,1,aww
 Ay nice, I have a black glass and a solid version of that desk set up; super affordable and useful!,1,aww
I’m assuming it is a glass top?,1,aww
That looked like a terrifying moment,1,aww
I once took a large poster off my wall due to construction outside shaking the walls so bad I thought it was going to vibrate the frame off the wall...my cat freaked out when she realized it wasn't there any longer, cats are weird.,1,aww
Have the same desk and I hate it. Can’t stretch your legs out properly because of the bar under there,1,aww
2 pointer or 3?,1,aww
I used to have that desk and loved it! Keeping it clean was the worst, and made me mange my cables way more because if how visible everything was.,1,aww
Grats on the thousands of karma that Auri just generated! :),1,aww

She did a trick!! Perfect form!,1,aww
Amazing how it can fuck up so badly and still make it look good. Every other animal would face-plant in this situation...but it just lands graciously and shrugs it off.,1,aww
I have the desk, Amazon?,1,aww

Hey, I have the same desk. My cat loves laying on the glass in the Summer.,1,aww

Ugh cats are so cute,1,aww

How many times did he do it?  Also, is that the Linda desk?,1,aww
If only I had that much grace when going for an extra step that isn't there.,1,aww

You broke your cat. Lol.,1,aww
I actually have that same desk (got it used 2 years ago), and never realized that circular part was meant to turn it into a corner desk. It all makes sense now!!!,1,aww
I have the same desk how neat,1,aww
Stupid dog,1,aww
I have the exact same desk! I have to try with my cat now...,1,aww
I have the same desk, nice.,1,aww
Awww poor meowYou’re a magician according to her,1,aww
200MB for 20 seconds? Is this a joke, OP?,1,aww
I don't understand why most animals have trouble seeing glass. Is there some kind of abstraction required that most animals are not capable off? Glass isn't really invisible. So something has to be fucking with animal brains to have them act silly.,1,aww
Dude I have that same desk!!,1,aww
I have that desk lol,1,aww
I guess birds aren't the only ones who don't understand glass. lol,1,aww
I have that desk. And a cat. Hmm.,1,aww
My parents used to have a glass topped coffee table that I loved to climb on. Well, as I was getting bigger, my mom was worried I would break the glass and get all cut up. So they took the glass off. I then proceeded to climb up, business as usual, and fall straight off the edge like a lemming. My dad can't tell the story without dying laughing. That cat is my spirit animal.,1,aww
I have that same desk. I have had it for 7+ years and it is still going strong.,1,aww
I have same desk, different cat,1,aww
Foot,1,aww
I had the same desk got it off of amazon,1,aww
reminds me of my cat.,1,aww
How many times did he try to jump on the table?,1,aww
“Hooman, what have you here?”,1,aww
Hhhhhhhaaaaaa,1,aww
I love when his feets line up perfectly with where the table is supposed to be,1,aww
Either that or he understood it perfectly,1,aww
No bueno, Don. No bueno. What's next? Shrooms and David Lynch films? You, blackmagicfuckery bafoon.,1,aww
My dogs do something simlar with our beds.We use the metal foundations instead of box springs. So when we have mattresses off to clean & just the slip pad on metal frame. The dogs jump on it thinking its solid, then learn its not lmao,1,aww
This made me smile.Thanks for sharing I needed this (just one of those Monday's GRRR),1,aww
this is amazing, it made me giggle out loud, and is utterly adorable. Thanks, OP.,1,aww
Awwww,1,aww

But the thing. Its my thing, why wrong?!,1,aww
I have the same desk!,1,aww
lol that cat's never gonna trust that table again even after you put the glass back on. It will probably screw his mind if you put him on it like "what kind of sorcery is this hooman?!",1,aww
Lol when he tries to find glass with his paw,1,aww
That feline must have thought it would make quite the landing.,1,aww
Pause it when the cat reaches the invisible glass and you realise how accurate their jumps are, all four paws are on the "glass" flat.,1,aww
You know what I don’t understand? Why we still have these giant, long, slow, GIF’s. It’s like sending a fax in 2018.,1,aww
I think my cat and your cat are twins,1,aww
 I have that exact same desk. Way to go NFM!,1,aww
Hey we have the same desk!,1,aww
For a second I thought this was my old room,  same carpet, wall color, desk and even same keyboard lol,1,aww

This is the equivalent to dogs wont enter glass door with the glass removed,1,aww
Cutest,1,aww
Never have I noticed how accurately a cat plans its jumps until now,1,aww
WE HAVE THE SAME DESK OP, WE'RE PRACTICALLY BROTHERS,1,aww
Ayee I have that exact same desk,1,aww
How many tries did she make before you started filming?,1,aww
I have exactly the same desk. I also have a cat. I'm going to try this.,1,aww

I used to have this exact desk with a Z5500 in the same spot. Neat.,1,aww

I have this exact desk! Does the top of yours fall off too if you bump it the wrong way?,1,aww

I’m pretty sure I just ordered that exact desk. You like it?,1,aww

This is amazing😄 I hope someone can overlay the calculations going on in the cute kitties head like with the math equations and such. I'd do it but I don't even know where to start lol,1,aww
How can an animal be so stupid and yet so smart at the same time.,1,aww
Hey, I have that desk! Hey! I have cats... I wonder how they'll react,1,aww

My brother has this exact same desk.,1,aww
LOOK AT HIS FRISKY WHISKERS,1,aww
I love how the cat checks the table with its paw in the end, like: "..the fuck? ....seems solid...",1,aww
Our cats are twins. It's like watching a video of my cat,1,aww
10/10 outstanding high jump,1,aww
Just magic!,1,aww
Poor kitty keeps going to the human and looks up like, "Would someone PLEASE explain this to me? I'm getting not a little freaked out!" Or, "OK, whose been screwing with my stuff?" For those who aren't cat fans, (I can't believe there would be such a person) cats think EVERYTHING is is theirs. All they have to do is rub the sides of their faces on an object- or human- and BOOM it's theirs!,1,aww
How I slide into them DM’s,1,aww

My grandpa used to say ‘smart like a combine’,1,aww
He'd be good friends with that dog that didn't understand a glass top table (when the owner dropped a snack on it and the dog went looking for it on the floor and was generally bamboozled)?,1,aww
My Internet isn't very good :(I'll never be watching a 185 MB gif. I'll use my imagination though.,1,aww

I had to do a double take because this cat is the identical twin of my cat. I even looked over to see if he was in his bed.,1,aww
This gif is single handedly clogging the internet.,1,aww
/r/catpranks,1,aww
Cats are surprisingly smart, they don't quite understand whats going on but they acknowledge when things happen and something is different. I fill up bottles with water and my cat knows water comes out the tap so he goes looking for it and down the sink but doesn't quite understand what it is im doing.,1,aww
I had that same desk from staples!,1,aww

COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
They got her a gift, too! Aww!,8995,aww
Awww! I just want to hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Too cute.,3715,aww
She is too adorable!!!,15278,aww
She seems nice,5815,aww
The best birthday surprises are the ones you don't expect. Once I remember punching in at work and the machine playing happy birthday. It was just a machine but it somehow meant a lot to me in that moment.,1646,aww
I miss my Grandma.,673,aww
Be kind to people. Love them. They are hurting and they need it.,4236,aww
After all those “Oh gawd, mum no” birthday cake surprises, I’m glad to see one that’s more me.My childhood was awful, I never actually got to celebrate my birthday, closest was one time where they wanted to take pics for family members, so they decked the table with food and made me sit prettily. No birthday party, even today at 28.If someone would surprise me with a birthday party or even a cake, I honestly think I would cry.EDIT:Wrote this right before going to bed, and waking up to this was, well, I cried in the bathroom. From kind messages to offers for proper mothering, it’s all amazing, and somewhat overwhelming. I’m not exactly used to anyone paying me any mind, and now I’m crying again.I will reply to everyone who messaged me, but for the moment I’ll say this:Because I live in The Netherlands, and nowhere near many of you, I won’t be able to take you up on your offer for a party or being my DJ. In this case however, the thought most definitely counts. Thank you very much.,2090,aww
Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN,572,aww
This made me so emotional.,97,aww
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material,286,aww
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.,277,aww
She still has the childlike wonder.,141,aww
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.,138,aww
That’s all it takes. Minimal effort. It takes minimal effort to be kind and nice to people. Remember that next time you’re out and about.,61,aww
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!,246,aww
Selfish question: the woman in this video reminds me so much of my ex-girlfriends mother. We’ve been broken up for nearly 2 years— but I’ve never forgotten the love and support her mother gave me. Absolutely wonderful woman— but no desire to get back together with her daughter. Would it be a weird move to send my ex-girlfriend’s mother a letter, just thanking her for everything she did for me? I feel guilty I never properly expressed my gratitude at the time— but don’t want her to be weirded out by some random card from her daughters old boyfriend.,48,aww
This lady looks like she would bake the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.,94,aww
And you just know they wouldn’t have bothered if she wasn’t someone that they really liked. Someone that really deserved a sweet surprise.,73,aww
Waitresses never kiss me on the cheek.,56,aww
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.,115,aww
Props to the waitress, what a genuinely warm hug and peck on the cheek, bless her heart too. Back when my dad was still living, and in an assisted living facility, I would see him and his elderly floor mates very often.Nothing made them light up more than a young person spending time with them, the younger the better.And if you brought a baby, we’ll forget about it, plan on spending the whole day because you will see the sheer joy that a baby will bring to this generation that raised a lot of us.If you’re a teenager reading OP’s post with a smile. Say hello to someone this darling woman’s age, help them with their groceries, or pay for their coffee. More often than not, you won’t be disappointed. Your heart will swell like the Grinch’s when he clapped eyes on little CindyLoo Who.Here’s hoping this woman has many more birthdays and each are filled with this much joy, if not more.,22,aww
Can all things on the internet be things like this please,20,aww
Looks like they dropped a heavy gift bag on her too.,44,aww
When we get older, we don't put as much value on our birthdays. It's easy to just let them pass by with minimal fuss when we're adults. But something like this, this little reminder that it is an important day, especially to just a casual acquaintance, is incredibly nice and meaningful.,16,aww
Oh my god she seems like an absolute sweetheart, she's the sorta customer I miss from working customer service.,16,aww
This is so precious, and her husband is wearing a checkered shirt too!She seems a really, really lovely person. :),13,aww
That makes me cry. That's more than I got on my birthday. It's nice to be noticed and feel wanted.,12,aww
I want to just give her a squeeze! Her face is just pure joy and appreciation.,23,aww
This looks irish,22,aww
The amount of feels I’m having right now...,11,aww
I am a cold, bitter, broken old man and even I liked this one.,10,aww
I LOVE THIS!!!!,11,aww
These are the types of people that make working at a restaurant totally worth it! Happy birthday to this sweet soul who is obviously so deeply cared for!,10,aww
She’s perfect for the old guy from UP,32,aww
Just got off the phone with my mom wishing her a happy birthday. After seeing this I would have given a lot to do this same thing for my mom,10,aww
Can we talk about how they match?,7,aww
What a beautiful moment!,6,aww
This brings tears to my eyes. My grandmother and I had a diner we would get breakfast at almost everyday. Once she became weaker we went less and less. Everyone at the restaurant knew us by name and had our order in before we even sat down, we truly felt like family. She would write personal cards and get gifts for every staff member on their birthdays and holidays. Everyone loved her and would come out of the kitchen to give hugs and kisses. She passed away a year ago. This brings me so many good memories about her thank you.,8,aww
You’re going to make me cry.,17,aww
Wow really nice!  Small gesture but it goes so far!,7,aww
Man I wish there was a subreddit for happy old people,7,aww
I work in a hospital ER and the other day and one of our patients came in on his 97th birthday. He had no nobody with him.The catering service sent up a little chocolate cake and all the nurses came into his room and sung him happy birthday. He was so happy he was crying.,5,aww

u/commonvanilla Do you know this woman? She looks very much like my mother and has very similar mannerisms.,11,aww
Oh my god she’s so cute! 10/10, would hug,17,aww
I need a hug like that rn.,6,aww
The way she looked at them after she gave her a hug and put her face in her hands was so endearing. Props to that staff!,5,aww
I fucking love how appreciative people are. This is some good shit, fuck yea it’s good to see this,5,aww
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady’s day.,5,aww
Awwwww the rest of the world, listen up. Be this. Please. I hate not having this everywhere. We would all live in heaven just for a little bit if we could do this,13,aww
Brb melting,3,aww
I bet she makes amazing cookies,5,aww
Sure, the granny is adorable. But she looks like a Grade-A certified Badass with her collar popped like that. Like she could go full John Wick on you if your not careful,4,aww
OP here after a sound night’s sleep (no school, no sleep deprivation tonight). I can’t believe what a beautiful response this has gotten. This video I brightened my entire weekend after a stressful week and I’m overjoyed to see so many people liking it too. Reading through all the nice comments directed to this video and to the other commenters...it’s such a change from normal reddit.For some who have asked, no it isn’t me. This is a video I found off Instagram that was too beautiful not to share.,4,aww
What gentle soul! A ball of positive energy, an most of all, a destroyer of cakes and baked goods,3,aww
Can I hug her?,4,aww
so precious,5,aww
People like this made waiting tables almost worth it.,8,aww
Tickled pink!,3,aww
Meanwhile in other threads little spoiled shits are like "ugh! I can't believe someone would do that to me!",3,aww
i miss my nana,3,aww
I need a hug from this sweet lady.,3,aww
 I react this way every time I’m given cake, even if I’m buying it for myself,3,aww
She looks like such a genuine person.,3,aww
she deserves so much more than free cake ♡,3,aww
Delightful!!,3,aww
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen,3,aww
So cute! So much happy! I love it. She’s so appreciative.,3,aww
I haven't recieved a birthday gift since I was like 14 years old. I'd probably react that way to free birthday cake too!,3,aww
 Haven’t had cake in my bday in over 10 years. I’m a 35 year old man, I think I would even get a little teary eyed.,3,aww
This seriously brought a tear to my eye. So sweet.,3,aww
I don't know this lady but I love her so much.,3,aww
awwe. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years as a server/busser. This elderly couple always came in at 1pm. God I loved them. One day the wife didn’t come. She had passed away. :( my boss let me take the day off. Sometimes when you’re working at restaurants you really look forward to seeing your regulars.,3,aww
That made her year. This is awesome. This comment will get buried but I don’t care. This video is amazing.,3,aww
Give her everything!,3,aww
So precious!,3,aww
I’d love to run a little cafe just so I can make these kinds of friendships,3,aww
I literally feel unworthy of watching her pureness she is downright an angel,3,aww
I love her already..,3,aww
her reaction is priceless <3,3,aww
I audibly whispered aww.. my friend heard, was interested, and ultimately awwgreed,3,aww
Omg she’s the cutest. I want to be friends with her. PS. I’m a 26 year old guy.,3,aww
I wish I grow old like her many decades after and people around are still as kind,3,aww
Old people are cuter than babies, don't @ me,3,aww
I want to give that woman a hug,3,aww
Awww Happy Birthday!! We all love you and you’re adorable!!,3,aww
Sweet, reminds me of my angel mother. My mother deserves her life story to be published in the Library of Congress archives. And all of love I can give her.  Love you mom!,3,aww
SHE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED,3,aww
What a joy to be loved.,3,aww
That is a woman that does not get appreciated enough in her daily life.,3,aww
This makes me want to hug my mom.,3,aww
This place looks like a nice place to eat,7,aww
You can just tell she is a humble person!,6,aww
What a lovely gesture and reaction!!,6,aww
I’ve noticed how older women are so much more appreciative of the little things...,7,aww
And now I'm crying.,5,aww
Fuck all the niceties, I hope they have some freaky birthday sex.,3,aww
This is so sweet,4,aww
Waitress was going in for the lips for a second there,4,aww
Well shit i cried within the 8 seconds,4,aww
This is what life's all about.,3,aww
Man I gotta call my grandma,3,aww
Sweet!,5,aww
What a nice lady,4,aww
So sweet,5,aww
This is great to see! Maybe one of the first times I’ve see someone truly appreciate this gesture.,2,aww
Sooooo cuuute!,2,aww
That is so nice! Great job!,2,aww
Cherish every moment.,2,aww
:),2,aww
Lovin' the best of humanity!,2,aww
This made her day I bet!!!! RAK!!!,2,aww
I would give her all the presents and cake!,2,aww
Oh why is there never a mirror bot when I need it?,2,aww
She reminds me of a scene in The Office where Tobey’s little girl asks Phyllis if she’s mother goose!! That scene was adorable!,2,aww
This is exactly what I needed while studying for 4 exams :D,2,aww
I need to remind myself at 52 that it’s ok to have joy like this on my birthday. I need to give MYSELF joy too! My son is 14 today and the joy on his face from the gift of black and white skull sheets, a longboard and some goofy tchotchkes is unmeasurable.,2,aww
Coming from someone who works in retail:EVERYONE should be that excited to be given free stuff. The world needs more people like her. <3,2,aww
Small towns really are the best about this. My grandparents have been going to the same Italian restaurant every Friday night for 20+ years and the owner still has their special table & recognizes me from when I was a toddler,2,aww
I don’t know why this sweet lady is making me tear up but here I am. I hope she had a good birthday. <3,2,aww
Omg she reminds me of my mom!!! My moms health isn’t well, so this is a reminder I need to give her lots of love.Eep, I may cry now.,2,aww
Ohmygoodness! I bet that hug was so soft and smellnice!,2,aww
I send you a Happiest Birthday from me a total stranger.   I have stolen several relatives from other people,  you are the latest.  I have  no relatives left , stealing them is my way of getting new ones & only the best.  You are a lovely lady.  Eat your cake & others for years to come.  You are now my "Auntie!"   See you next year.,2,aww
They got her a gift too?!! Jesus Christ how sweet are those waitresses?,2,aww
True graciousness. What a sweetheart!!,2,aww
Looks like the lady who constantly complains but the restaurant has a good heart so they gave her a gift,2,aww
I miss my mom.,2,aww
That is the sweetest thing iv ever seen. So genuine,2,aww
These regulars.  This is why I absolutely love my job.,2,aww
That looks like a very sweet little lady. Reminds me how much I miss my grandma.,2,aww
Just beautiful 💕💕💕,2,aww
She is the cutest!,2,aww
She reminds me of the sweet old lady with syphilis on House!,2,aww
I wanna hug that grandma ;-;,2,aww
I would give any of my big spending regulars to be able to wait on these two... I’m sure they are a god damned pleasure!,2,aww
I don't even know her and I love her. Damn you reddit!,2,aww
This is so precious! My heart can't take it!,2,aww
The genuine joy on her face, oh my goodness 😍,2,aww
can she tell me it’s all goin to be okay,2,aww
Gosh, this gave me a cheery.  I miss my mum \*Wibble,2,aww
It costs you so little to be kind. Be kind to someone today!,2,aww
She might be the cutest thing I have ever seen. What are puppies?,2,aww
Had something similar happen to my husband on his birthday earlier this year. Diner we're semi-regulars at (him even more than me) gave him a cake with ice cream as a surprise when they found out it was his birthday. It wasn't even my birthday, but just seeing someone be so kind to someone they only know through brief encounters at their job absolutely warmed my heart. It's nice to realize there are people out there you don't even realize that care.,2,aww
So jealous...would love to have an opportunity to make someone feel that way 🤗,2,aww
26 year old dude, I can’t! 😭,2,aww
Damn this is the sweetest thing I have ever seen.,2,aww
As you get older, birthdays are a reminder that time is passing. Not all birthdays are happy days. The look on this lady's face is wonderful. She is truly overcome by the kindness expressed by the staff working in the place she is eating. I feel her emotion and understand it. It is a mix of happiness, surprise, gladness and perhaps some pain. I wish her much happiness.,2,aww
I wish I had the ability to feel happy like that about something.,2,aww
I wonder how many people suddenly got an urge to call/see there grandma. I already know mine would ask if I'd eaten anything yet the second I show up.,2,aww
this is too wholesome.,2,aww
Oh my. My heart.,2,aww
I know that for many people, they absolutely dread social interaction... but for some of us, the interaction with bartenders/servers is the only social interaction we get.,2,aww
They made her feel so special! That’s some human goodness.,2,aww
That'll be $10,2,aww
As a server every restaurant has these precious few who we all care about and are willing to chip in money for birthday gifts. They give reactions like this and then leave a handwritten thank you card. Those regulars make our day despite tip. They are civil to us and treat us like family. Bless that woman and the impact she has had on her servers. She deserves the best.,2,aww
I want to give her a hug and talk to her all Sunday afternoon,2,aww
I want to travel to wherever she is and give her the biggest hug. She looks so touched, bless her.,2,aww
Old people are awesome.,2,aww
You can tell she's genuinely happy. Things like this is why I haven't given up on humanity.,2,aww
Awww, people being lovely to one another,2,aww
You just know she's going to smell like biscuits when you hug her.,2,aww
Omg I love her,2,aww
I’m sad and miss my Grandma now. I hope this lady is doing good. Not that she’s definitely a Grandma. But reminded me of her.,2,aww
r/mademesmile,2,aww
Like my mom, literally, exactly same reaction. <3,2,aww
Oh man. This hit me in the soft place. I work in ths hospitality industry, and I've tried to make it a point to stress relationships like this. The problem is the further up you go, the farther you get from it. I miss times like this.,2,aww
This is the highest upvoted post I have ever seen. And I like that.,2,aww
I love my mom. I don't tell her it enough... I need to go tell my mom I love her before its too late.Wow I'm getting teary eyed.,2,aww

She looks 80 but acts like an 8 year old girl (in the most positive way possible).,2,aww
Look at the bitch all jelly in the background... just munching away looking like someone else's happiness is spoiling her appetite. I just got off an eleven hour shift and that lady might be a saint but at this point anything but a smile looks like they want the manager.,2,aww
The lady in the very back has the poker face of Wendy Byrde,2,aww
They are matching! It gets cuter!!!,2,aww

It’s those damn circular glasses, they’re just too cute.,2,aww
Made me smile. Ear to ear.,2,aww
It was after this that ex leader & commander of Berlins notorious Hitler youth Gertrud hemmel was descovered. She was responsible for the persecution of Jews, LGBT and people of African descent. all thanks to this video,2,aww
I think the lady in the back lit the candle with her gaze.,2,aww
Love to see these things.,2,aww
The lady in the background? No one..?,2,aww
Good people.,2,aww
The older you get, the less amount of acknowledgment you get on your birthday. That needs to change.,2,aww

That is officially the cutest couple Ive ever seen. They’re wearing the same shirts! #relationshipgoals,1,aww
Aw, shucks. Well that's just the sweetest darn thing ever.,1,aww
I want to bake her all the cakes.,1,aww
Sometimes humans do nice things and remind me not to hate them all. 😊,1,aww
Why is Reddit making me cry again,1,aww
She looks like a little kid. Too damn cute.,1,aww
Shes so cute omg,1,aww
Beautiful gesture!,1,aww
True r/aww,1,aww
For the business, as a customer nice to know you care.For the customer, it's nice to know a business notices you.,1,aww
This is the type of lady I want to become. Surely she's a very loving person to have made so many friends in life, and she's so appreciative,1,aww
She looks like a 10/10 grandma. Also for a split second you see her husband who looks like the cutest sweetest old man!,1,aww
Is this in Ireland?,1,aww
Damn, she reminds me of my grandma. I miss her.,1,aww
You restore my faith in humanity! Thank you!,1,aww
She's so sweeeeet! I wanna hug her!,1,aww
You never know if this was one of the only birthdays someone acknowledged for her.,1,aww
No old couple is complete without matching shirts.,1,aww
Omg my heart!!,1,aww
Granny's pilled out,1,aww
Such a heartwarming gesture!,1,aww
Wow I didn’t expect to start crying,1,aww
That's goddam adorable,1,aww
Why can't more of us find the joy in life like this?!,1,aww
Bless her,1,aww
r/gifsthatendedtoosoon,1,aww
Happy birthday to her!,1,aww

I hope I can make someone this happy one day,1,aww
This is so cute,1,aww
the title is so itchy. free cake? and this why she is happy? she's happy because they care about her birthday.,1,aww
That's really sweet.,1,aww
That lady has to have a dog named Courage.,1,aww
Uhh. Pretty sure that lady behind her wants her dead. Wtf.,1,aww
Making people happy feels better than just about anything... Truth,1,aww
Right in the feels,1,aww
For whatever reason I sadly think her kids are assholes. They could be dead, but it just really seems like she "expects" this, just not from these people. Really great video honestly, and makes me want to call my Bestemor.,1,aww
This is so hecking cute,1,aww
Sometimes, the smallest gestures are gigantic to those without family or friends. Thanks for sharing this.,1,aww
She is genuine, she is great!Also, this is me everyday of the week working free fake birthday deserts at chain restaurants.,1,aww
Aww, my heart.,1,aww
This is the cutest!,1,aww
I want to cry,1,aww
Hey is that my aunt’s friend. She is 69 this year,1,aww
This is wonderful!,1,aww
This made my heart warm!,1,aww
Every single thing about this screams England,1,aww
Can life be more of this please? Kthxbye. 🙃,1,aww
This is so sweet!One of the only things I miss about being a server were my regulars. A good regular could really improve my mood during a bad shift.,1,aww
You can see the little girl she used to be with that expression and arm movement. So adorable!,1,aww
I’m ugly crying over this,1,aww
The little things really do matter,1,aww
That is so sweet!,1,aww
I love this! She’s so cute!!!!,1,aww
I don't know how, and I've never said this before in my life, but "heartwarming" is a gross understatement.,1,aww
Dawwwww I love her!!,1,aww
This ain’t it chief *sniffles* this ain’t it,1,aww
What an incredibly beautiful moment,1,aww
The world is filled with good people,1,aww
The older woman is adorable, but what is up with the woman in the back staring at the wait staff like she's deciding which one to eat first?,1,aww
She’s so cute (:,1,aww
Beautiful.,1,aww
So sweet!!,1,aww
My greatest regret as an adult is not taking the time to get to know my grandfather when he was so adamant on informing me of the Mayan civilization. Please love and appreciate those around you, having a loving family is so special.,1,aww
This is so sweet that I need a couple extra hearts to even fathom the cuteness without exploding.,1,aww
the act was more critical than the 'free',1,aww
Damn. I lost my grandma about 4 years ago. I’m strange about mourning death. I don’t necessarily get sad and if I do it doesn’t last long. Granted my grandma and I were not super close but seeing this almost brought tears to my eyes. She looked strikingly similar to this woman and acted in that same mannerism.,1,aww
My heart is melting. This is so sweet!,1,aww
Kneaders?,1,aww
Can i have her as my grandma?,1,aww
Scamming people into getting yourself a cake by faking birthday . Trick is sure as old as this grandma.,1,aww
But does she remember is the 21st of September.,1,aww
I hated getting sung to at a restaurant, I hated the spotlight. But later on I loved pranking my dates with a fake birthday surprise at restaurants. I guess it was pretty juvenile in retrospect.,1,aww
Proper, surprise.,1,aww
Could be wrong, but is this Bob Evans?,1,aww
The sweetest!,1,aww
Awwwwww there is still some goodness left in this world!!!! I love it. Every part of it. She is so beautiful! Gargh .... XD,1,aww
I always loved surprising customers with free pancakes and icing for their birthday. Recently I had a little boy who had his birthday and when I came out with his birthday pancakes, both him and his dad were so happy! It made my night just seeing their smiling faces!,1,aww
My heart 😢😢😢,1,aww
Shout out to the server too, the joy on her face at being able to do something like this makes me smile too :),1,aww
r/mademesmile,1,aww
Welp, time to call grandma and tell her I love her.,1,aww
Awwwww she is sooooo cute omg,1,aww
this is so insanely adorable,1,aww
I love that I went into the controversial section of the comments and I found no negative comments about this sweet little lady. I would upvote twice if I could.,1,aww

Damn. I want a hug,1,aww
Grandma poppin that collar!,1,aww
She looks like what Queen Elizabeth would have looked like if she grew up middle class in South Carolina,1,aww
That's so sweet!,1,aww
I love old people. Yes, even the mean ones.I'm 32 and I had a client at my work named Henry. He was in his late 80s. He was always incredibly firm, abrupt and short when you would talk to him. One time, after knowing him for like 12 years and seeing him multiple times a year (I was his accountant) and never getting more than a few words from him and a glare, I mentioned that I was brewing beer at home. He immediately changed, everything from his posture to the sound of his voice, even his eyes. We talked about beer for maybe 30 minutes. It was fun and it was like talking to a completely different man. He told me about all his favorite beers, what meals he would have with each one, everything. He passed a few months after that conversation. I feel like there was so much more that I could've learned about him had I only had the time or maybe said the right few words to get him to open up a few years earlier.,1,aww
This should get 100000000x up votes and hopefully remind us all that it’s the little things that matter most,1,aww
This is why you treat everyone you encounter with respect.,1,aww
There are people like this, and people who expect free cake on their birthday,1,aww
I’m not crying you’re crying,1,aww
I cried!,1,aww
Humans being bros/friends :3,1,aww
They look British,1,aww
My heart!!!,1,aww
Meanwhile death stare from woman near the window.,1,aww
She seems absolutely gorgeous. I'm so glad the employees care enough about her to do something for her.,1,aww
The people at the table behind her are not impressed.,1,aww
This put a smile on my face, what a nice surprise,1,aww
Aw! Love it!,1,aww
I'm not crying, you'r crying.,1,aww
aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww,1,aww

Husband was turning around to see where his cake was,1,aww
Goddamnit. It’s just so real and precious. We need SO MUCH MORE of this in today’s world. I literally can’t even.,1,aww
Aww the best and the cutest reaction ever. I so wish I could give her that surprise to get that smile on her face.,1,aww
She doesn't look like the kind of person who wants her face splashed all over the internet. But hey, you get that karma.,1,aww
GOD BLESS REGULARS 😭💜,1,aww
Hit me right in the feels,1,aww
Reminds me of my mom,1,aww
Too sweet. True happiness. Made me smile.,1,aww

This literally warmed my heart, a big o happy birthday to her!!,1,aww
Damn it, that's real nice.,1,aww
Super cute,1,aww
Came to post she was adorable but I see someone else already said that. I love her. I could watch this forever!,1,aww
I'm older than the Reddit crowd but please give your mom, dad and grandparents a call.  If you had that friends that passed give their parents a call.  It means the world to them.,1,aww
Sooo sweeet,1,aww
That is SO. PRECIOUS.,1,aww
warming,1,aww
This is why a service/hospitality is a real job. There’s few things as rewarding as making someone’s day like this. Tip your servers, people! -service industry professional,1,aww
I miss my grandma,1,aww
I'm gonna fucking die that's so adorable. I wish her 100 more happy birthdays.,1,aww
That lady is nicer than I’ll ever be. What an innocent human.,1,aww
You all make me belive that life is worth continuing on for...,1,aww
How sweet and sad at the same time. She's obviously not used to being showed such special attention. She is very precious. Happy Birthday!!!,1,aww
Gorgeous,1,aww
She definitely gives good hugs and smells like cookies.,1,aww
I almost cried this is too sweet.,1,aww
Oh no now I’m going to cry, that’s too precious.,1,aww
I want to take care of her!!! Now!!!! :(Hope she has a family that loves her and treats her well!! ;___;,1,aww
 Aww I want to give her a hug, she is so sweet!,1,aww
She is so cute. :),1,aww
i'm gonna cry,1,aww
There still is good in this world and people who deserve it—thank you!,1,aww
Amazing how just by looking at her body language we can know exactly how happy she is,1,aww
Love.,1,aww
Mah heart. Mah souuuullll. This legitimately makes me cry though,1,aww
I need a subreddit for videos like this where you see the inner kid. This video, there was that video a while back where an older woman was given a new stove, dad gets a puppy...all those videos where it makes no difference whether the person is 5 or 85, the reactions are the same.,1,aww
Aww this video makes me smile. :),1,aww
Wow she seems pretty happy, you can expect at least a 5% percent tip this time!,1,aww
MY HEART OMG,1,aww
A little cake and love can go long way,1,aww
Very cute. She has this kinda Howls moving castle Witch of the waste look about her.,1,aww
That is so nice,1,aww
If she was an aunt of mine I'd visit her everyday,1,aww
This is way too sweet :) I hope she had a wonderful birthday!,1,aww
I cannot hear anything— Is it just me?,1,aww
Kinda makes me feel sad, like that's the first time in a while that someone has done something nice for her. Glad it made her happy. Ought to happen more.,1,aww
this brightened my day. thanks for sharing.,1,aww
I've worked in restaurants for years, and its moments like these, and customers like her, that make it bearable. Too often the restaurant industry shows the worst in mankind, but there are always those people out there that are simply wonderful.,1,aww
The only person who doesn't hate restaurant staff singing happy birthday,1,aww
I want her to hug me.,1,aww
This makes me miss my mom. She hasn't passed away but has moved out of state.,1,aww
This makes me happy,1,aww
You can tell the waitress really loves her, too, and the little Yiayia goes in for a hug right away, gahhh I love this so much I can’t deal with it.,1,aww
I’m not crying, you’re crying!,1,aww
Sticking cameras in their faces negates these acts,1,aww
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.,1,aww
I paused it at the perfect time. https://imgur.com/oHV6cN9,1,aww
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.,1,aww
Awe so sweet,1,aww
This reminds me of me mum.,1,aww
Fella's just looking back to see if he gets a piece too.,1,aww
That is the exact same face my mother is excited to the point of overwhelmed about something,1,aww
This is so wholesome!,1,aww
we as younger people always take/took it for granted. well, at least i did. she probably hasn't had anyone make a big deal about her birthday in years. you can tell by her reaction. what a sweetheart.,1,aww
Wish someone did this for me on my cake day :(,1,aww
I love people like this.,1,aww
So there is some faith in humanity,1,aww
How couldn’t this make anyone happy,1,aww
Please leave us a big tip.I’m just trolling. This is fucking adorable!,1,aww
I like her,1,aww

Awwwww! Just a real person in a real moment of her own real life! So sweet!,1,aww
So sweet,1,aww
I can't up vote this enough. She's too cuuuuuute.,1,aww
Ok done. Now let’s hit the next joint for free cake!,1,aww
Why am I crying?,1,aww
I literally shed a tear so stinkin cute,1,aww
The free cake was worth it.,1,aww
Sometimes getting a present isn't about how much big and expensive it is, but the gesture,1,aww
Bless her angel heart!,1,aww
She’s my favorite person of the day.Her husband takes second place for his clear confusion.,1,aww
Is this in England?,1,aww
This has gone so wholesome... thanks all, sometimes I feel silly cause I got so much feels.  Nice to know I'm not alone.,1,aww
This restored some of my faith in humanity,1,aww
God that's so wholesome I could die.,1,aww
Oh my gosh old people are my favorite,1,aww
Love her!,1,aww
That woman at the very back seems like she's grimacing.,1,aww
This is the most heartwarming thing I’ve seen all year; I must hug that woman.,1,aww
I wish everyone I bought dessert to reacted like this... but then again not because I would probably cry!,1,aww
That's pretty sweet.,1,aww
My heart just melted!,1,aww
Welp I cried.,1,aww
I want a hug!!,1,aww
Little shit like this sticks with people,1,aww

Hehe the little apology at the end is too cute,1,aww
Aww, everyone is so happy!,1,aww
I gotta say when my day just ends up being the usual malaise of depression and sadness, I can always come here for a little "pick-me-up"! The smile on her face and the overall love in this video just makes the world seem brighter. To anyone out there feeling a little down: I love you and I hope things get better!,1,aww
That's what makes us humans after all,1,aww
"Teeheehee, its not even my birthday",1,aww
ITS.......SO......WHOLESOME,1,aww
Bad ass,1,aww
Little acts of kindness is what we are missing?  (Without a narcissistic, monetary reason, judgmental,  self-centered reason.),1,aww
Sweet grandma 💜💜💜💜,1,aww
This is the cutest grandma I have ever seen,1,aww
Aw! This warmed my heart. So sweet.,1,aww
She's not my grandma, but...Happy Birthday! I love you grandma,1,aww
 I can see the little girl  come out of her.,1,aww
I’m crying,1,aww
This is precious 😍,1,aww

Pure innocence warms your heart,1,aww

How sweet!!,1,aww
Do greay,1,aww
THATS SO CUTE,1,aww
She appreciates the “Happy Birthday” more than the cake.,1,aww
Old people like the simple things. My grandma just likes to leave the house.,1,aww
Yeah, but to be fair, she knows these people. This isn't the situation the posts have been talking about. 20 servers stampeding to your table and singing some shitty birthday song knockoff is a different situation.,1,aww
I could probably watch this forever...,1,aww
She reminds me of my mom. My mom would have the same reaction.,1,aww
I hope she had a good birthday,1,aww
Grandmas kiss everyone.  I love it.,1,aww
This reminds me of my Nana... She was a regular everywhere. Thanks for posting.,1,aww
Nothing gets me more than a good customer service story.,1,aww
Sometimes it’s just nice to be thought of and feel appreciated,1,aww
Much better than a group of idiots coming out to sing happy birthday.   Cringe to the max,1,aww
Oh my god, both her AND her (?)husband are so freakin' cute and make me wish I could adopt them as grandparents.,1,aww
#MY FEELERS,1,aww
I'm not crying. You're crying!,1,aww
I got free ice cream on my birthday today.,1,aww
The most wholesome fucking thing I’ve ever seen,1,aww
Ccutteee,1,aww
Happy cake day! 🍰,1,aww
She seems sweet but I do believe it's just an ability to act out your emotions effectively. I don't always express my body language effectively or appropriately and therefore I believe I can be misunderstood.,1,aww
As a long time server, regulars are what make our jobs worthwhile. She reminds me of a few of my own.,1,aww
I am sobbing profusely,1,aww
Definitely a british reaction,1,aww
I love her and I hope her birthday was magical,1,aww
my heart is melting. damn you grandma for being so adorable!,1,aww
The world needs much more of this on social media!,1,aww
Anyone else want to give that lady a nice 1-2min hug... she seems like such a sweet woman.,1,aww
Aw, I wish her all the best,1,aww
Awe, you can tell she’s an extremely nice woman. She looks so grateful that they are giving her cake and a gift. Good on you restaurant workers, the little things can mean so much to people and it shows right here.,1,aww
This so cute I’m kinda crying and I have a beard we normally don’t do that,1,aww
I've never cried at a Reddit post, but fuck this just did it.,1,aww
She is adorable 😍,1,aww
This makes my heart happy,1,aww
I’m 39  a yo man,now on a train.I’m having tears watching this.,1,aww
She is darling. What a pure human bean,1,aww
Omg so cute!,1,aww
It's not her birthday, she just wanted a free coffee 38 years ago and it's too late to back out now,1,aww
Cake.,1,aww
I love this, she fully embraced it. Whereas if this happened to me in a restaurant, I would be cringing with embarrassment.I need to lighten up!,1,aww
What the world needs now... is love sweet love,1,aww
Love your neighbors. Just like this Very cool We can all do this for someone,1,aww
This is so pure.,1,aww
Sometimes it takes so little to make someone happy.,1,aww
I love this.,1,aww
This is me when I get free anything,1,aww
This feels like the response of someone who doesn't receive this sort of affection much anymore. Here's to hoping I am wrong.,1,aww
Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday.,1,aww
God I feel like such an asshole avoiding elderly people, the ones I encounter at my work place are usually horrible so it makes it difficult. Her reaction makes her seem like an angel compared to them. BRAVO TO THAT RESTAURANT YALL GOT ME CHOKED UP AND SHIT,1,aww
This is the sort of thing that can cause me, a grown man, to break down. People don't realize how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone. You can see it in this woman's eyes what this meant to her. I'll never know this woman, but her joy is infectious. This is purely wholesome. Thank you, OP.,1,aww
If it went on any longer it would have landed on r/mademecry,1,aww
Awww so adorable,1,aww
This made me smile!,1,aww
She deserves it. How sweet!,1,aww
Cake Day!!,1,aww
That’s so sweet!!! Look at that lady mean mugging in the background. 😂 She’s like I want some damn cake too.,1,aww
Please hug me.,1,aww
Have no idea when this was taken but it’s my birthday today. I’m so happy to “share” this day with such a cute lady! I hope she felt just as loved and blessed as I felt today.,1,aww
I know this comment will get buried but this gif made me so happy. Her genuine joy and gratefulness reminds me of my late grandma. I forgot how much I missed her but this short clip was able reminded me of the all the good times we had,1,aww
She was really touched & surprised. It was genuine. It was appreciated,1,aww
I want to hug this sweet lady!,1,aww
God Bless Them,1,aww
Heartwarming indeed.,1,aww
Oh God, I'm too drunk for this :'),1,aww
that looks like someone who has been having hard times and just needed to feel appreciated. thank you young ladies!,1,aww
This is the cutest video I’ve ever seen in my life thus far :) she is so happy!,1,aww
I'm sitting here eating fried hot dogs with Charley and I come across this video.  Good stuff for me ...,1,aww
Everyone deserves kindness and love,1,aww
AWWWW,1,aww
Oh my god I want to give her a free cake every day,1,aww
This made me cry. I used up waitress and we had some elderly regulars that definitely came in to loved and treated like family. We’d chat with them, hug them, and take pictures with them. When you get shit on by customers and are feeling down you really look forward to your regulars that help you remember you are good at your job and you make a difference to people (and they make a difference to you too.),1,aww
It's so beautiful & sweet. I'm sitting here teary eyed!,1,aww
Im hard if hearing and lip read. Pretty sure she says “dont cry” as she wipes away her tears. 😭,1,aww
This made my day,1,aww
Aww ❤️ In the service industry, there are certain people who come along and make it worth it. She must be so genuinely kind for them to do that for her.,1,aww
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,1,aww
Holy crap this is the best thing I’ve seen all week.,1,aww
She is so cute!,1,aww
Oh I hope I can make someone that happy one day.,1,aww
Do people just get adorable as they get older? Is it something like how we perceive babys as cute?,1,aww
As someone who works in the service/retail industry... I fucking LOVE customers like this lady. That smile alone... I will bend over backwards for super sweet and just nice customers. It makes my whole day when someone comes in who doesn't really know me but treats me like an actual person. I have some great conversations with customers like this. If you want to avoid the pesky salesperson... ask them how their day is going. And then maybe you'll come in to some cake yourself one day,1,aww
That lady is just adorable. She must be so kind and loving.,1,aww
Oh my word. This made me cry. She looks exactly like my friend's Mom who just died unexpectedly. Her mannerisms were identical to this sweet lady. She always made sure we ate. We ate lots of cookies and cake. She'll be missed.,1,aww
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!,1,aww
You're not crying, I'm crying.,1,aww
These are the moments that make service industry bearable,1,aww
Why does she feel intensely?,1,aww
I can't tell if she is touched by the gesture or if she just gets obsessively excited over seeing cake (like I do),1,aww
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYINGI NEED TO PUNCH A BABY,1,aww
I don’t know her but I LOVE her.,1,aww
My heart just melted...small thing but made her day!,1,aww

This reminds me of the diner my papa used to frequent on a daily basis! The ladies that worked there just loved him dearly. They even let him bring in and keep his very own coffee cup in the diner. After he passed, they closed the diner to attend his funeral. They would do special things for his birthday(s), too. So sweet, just like this post. This lady is so overjoyed, she has tears! I love people that look out for the elderly. This lady is so sweet!,1,aww

True regulars are the best.  Even the stingy ones that you can hold a conversation with; you end up learning a lot and end up caring for them.  I honestly miss my serving life because of people like the lady and gentleman in the gif.,1,aww

I wanted to cuddle her and protect her at all costs.,1,aww
This is amazing. It gives me all the feels.,1,aww

She makes me miss my Mama so bad.,1,aww
The little girl inside her is healthy and fine 😊,1,aww

How do you train or prepare a dog to not be afraid of all the lights/sounds/people?  I have a boxer pup that loves people and other animals. I would love to take him to a baseball game, however I took him to the beach and he was afraid the whole time, tail between the leg, didn't want to say hi to anyone - totally not like himself. I'm worried he would be the same at a baseball game.,5,aww
The internet is an amazing thing.,2,aww
I swear I saw the video of this being taken somewhere else on here.,3,aww

Maybe it's just the uploaded picture but I didn't like the background focus and quality found it distracted from a good shot.  Did some quick edits to add a bit of lens blur to background and some slight balancing to reduce the highlights.https://i.imgur.com/KNK8Ufd.jpg,3,aww

He's rocking that handkerchief.  12/10,3,aww
The photo is cute but I can see from the behind the scenes video that your dog is overweight. Feeding him bread, cheese, sugar (in the sauce), and overfeeding are all bad for him. Especially since this breed characteristically overeats if they can. Please look after your pup by keeping him healthier.,6,aww
You sound suspiciously like a dog, OP.,8,aww

My dog would just gobble the whole thing up.,1,aww
12/10 doggo. 7/10 shot, should've positioned that giant light behind his head.,1,aww
Feeding a diaper hotdog is so bad. Esp one with cheese,1,aww
I get that it's cute but why are people okay with this? Doesn't it feel kind of scummy to use your pet in this way?,1,aww
The best boy!!,1,aww
I love how people just love animals. Nature’s way of giving human beings 100% natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety solution through unconditional love.,1,aww
Best ... Day ... Ever,1,aww
Hey wait a second!! This picture was taken from a different location than the video we all just saw! Did the good boy get 2 separate hot dogs? Did you take the first one out of his mouth and, then move to a different spot!?,1,aww
The original Post can be found under instagram: @dash.dog,1,aww
Someone took a video of you trying to get this photo. I saw the effort of the dog trying his best to not eat the hotdog. Glad the photo turned up perfect.,1,aww

I like how a good boy with a hot dog acquired more up votes then Burt Reynolds dying Lmao,1,aww
Pretty sure that has to be some sort of mental torture...Nice cap though,1,aww
Yassssss!,1,aww
Why on earth do the Mariners need public funding for upgrades to one of the best parks in the league? Doesn’t the city have a major homeless problem?,1,aww
I read in my dog training manual that dogs do not like mustard.  In fact, if you put mustard on a cracker somewhere-- they will condition themselves to not taking treats that are left out.    Just thought I should point out that dogs don't like the same flavors we do.,1,aww
Feed Nana,1,aww
Been waiting for this all day,1,aww

Do this at a stadium in one of the multicultural parts of Western Europe and people will be constantly asking/telling you to keep your dog away. I can't go to the park with my dog without seeing some scared weirdos run across the street to get away from my small dog.,1,aww

The guy looks like youtuber Shay Carl.,45,aww
His leash even looks like Chewbacca’s ammo belt,69,aww
HOV Lanes HERE I COME!!,13,aww
What breed?,15,aww
What a handsome dog.I heard dogs which have hair covering their eyes sometimes are afraid of walking around because they can't see very well.If he moves around very carefully you should try to give him a hair cut, it wont harm him and when it doesn't improve anything for him it'll grow back.Any way give him some bellyrubs from me.,28,aww
That seatbelt makes him look like Chewbacca 😂Edit: Just figured out it was a leash 😂,43,aww
More pics please,13,aww
I'd follow that dog's advice,11,aww

I hope you don’t take this as an insult because you have a nice beard, but damn...his is better.,5,aww
Cut the hair in front of his eyes back,28,aww

Ben looks like the kind of dog I'd like to have a beer with while coming up with some crazy business ventures we could blow our life savings on.,3,aww
 You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. That cannot be a dog. That is surely a sasquatch you have taken from its native environment. Return him, or her,  to their home else a legion of sasquatches/sasquatchi/sasquatcheses (Not really sure what you call a group of these beasts, if anyone knows please enlighten me) and their sassy hats shall picket your home.  Return him, and stop using the car pool lane!,3,aww
Ben has some nice sunglasses.,3,aww

Please trim your dog hair, poor thing can’t even see,5,aww
[removed],6,aww
I’ve been told it can negatively impact a dog’s vision health if their hair is long enough to cover their eyes. I know you may find it difficult to grant him eye contact as it will be nearly impossible to resist when he begs for a bite of the steak you grilled up for dinner... but it’s in his best interests in the long run (the haircut - not necessarily the steak).,4,aww
never ceases to amaze me how couples look more and more line each other as they age,2,aww
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.very hansom doggo,2,aww

So i think she trusts me especially,12993,aww

*on mobile* Double clicks dogs face for ultimate zoom potential*fucking dies*,139,aww
This is how I decided my dog was the one for me when he was a puppy. My mom let me choose a pup from a litter of probably a dozen pups. I found one I really liked because he kept sticking around me while all the other puppies ran around creating chaos or stuck to my sis/mom/the owners. We had to leave to go to the bank and get money once we decided. I told the lady specifically that I wanted "this one." and she promised she'd keep an eye on him since he had about 10 brothers/sisters that looked the same. We came back and all of the puppies were mixed in and she forgot to keep an eye on mine. As soon as we played with the puppies again all of the puppies began running around except one. One puppy stayed with me the moment we got to see the litter again. That's the very  pup I knew I was looking for. The rest is history!He's turning 20 this year and still going strong! Edit: here's a pic of him! https://imgur.com/a/hreMz,91,aww
That one gorgeous lady. She make any new friends? Breed please?,358,aww

This one literally brought me to tears. I had to return the dog I just adopted because it kept biting me, including in the face that got infected and I need to take antibiotics for. I see this and I weep knowing there are good dogs out there but am sad that I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never find one for me.You hug that dog and make sure it knows it is a good dog.,2,aww
Or that she still needs to go potty.,2,aww

We have a dog at work that is like this with her handler. She loves everyone and everything, but the complete and utter devotion she has for this guy is something to see.  If he leaves the area for even a moment and she can't follow, when he comes back she is just deliriously, knock people across the room her butt and tail are wagging so hard in joy happy that it kind of pangs my heart to see.,2,aww
That is awesome,2,aww
We don’t deserve dogs!,2,aww
I had a 95 lb lab mix that we adopted from the Humane Society that followed me so close his nose was always bumping on my butt. I had to be careful not to trip over him in the kitchen.  And I never had any privacy when I went to the bathroom.  He passed away a couple of months ago in January. I miss him so much.,2,aww
That is a beautiful dog, can't wait til I move into a bigger house to have my own.,2,aww
Everybody’s watching her, but she’s looking at yoouuu,2,aww

What a cool landlord. Mine is dumb as hell. He just replaced our 2 broken wall unit ACs with window units. They keep shutting off/not cooling and showing an error message, but he says it's because we have one of the bedroom doors closed. ? Also wants me to just leave them running because "they'll turn on eventually". Sigh.,7,aww

I remember once how when i lived at my first apartment, 18 years old immediately out of high school, and i didn't have many friends so i bought a cat. And he was the biggest asshole ever. One day i locked myself out of the apartment and i had this little table right next to my door and the peephole on the door allowed me to vaguely see the eye behind it. I could make out the green little slit of that fuckers eye watching me suffer outside. Kind of like this lol.,5,aww

As a European this "our landlord fixes stuff in our apartment while we're not home" concept seems so foreign.I'd never let some guy I hardly know into my apartment without me being there.And the apartments are usually rented empty so whatever sink is in there is mine and my responsibility.And the cat definitely looks like it has the same thoughts going through its head at that moment.,0,aww

This picture makes me happy.,9441,aww
Today my son pretended that the cat scratched him to see it get in trouble.,1676,aww
[Their relationship in one picture](https://imgur.com/a/VbVqcOS)  She's not even mad here. That's just her face. I got her from the pound when she was a few years old. I have had her 11 years and through a million moved and boyfriends and now she gets to be with me as I live a sedate life as a mom/wife. Don't overlook adult cats! She is the best impulse buy of my life. Photos are mine taken by @caseyraephoto on insta,12188,aww
I've said it before on reddit.Cats don't just want to go outside. They want to go outside WITH YOU. They want to explore with you and play in the grass with you and nap in the sun with you. When I figured that out I started taking a blanket into the front yard and my cat and I would lay out there while I played with my laptop and he scratched at the trees.Looks like Op's son has figured that out.,224,aww
Kalvin and Hobz,806,aww

Calvin and Hobbes,109,aww
My boy was a rescue cat. I think he tolerated me because he trusted me, but wasn’t ever really affectionate. That was until my little girl was born; he had finally found his human. He was 8kgs of part feral beast, unfriendly to almost everyone, and barely tolerating those of us he liked, but his girl; he adored. I would often find her sitting on him and “reading”. She would pull his whiskers and when she released them, he would bunt her from head to tail, miaow as if to say “are you coming?” and wait for her to crawl after him. He slept under her bed, cot, and next to her capsule. He would wait by the door when we left and miaow at me until he could smell her when we came home, making sure she was safe. He adored her. Rescue cats are the best.,107,aww
Reminds me of my son and my cat, Hoover.  My son is always chasing him around and trying to pet him, sometimes a little too rough.  Hoover tolerates it most of the time.,51,aww
I don’t get how your cat doesn’t run away. My cat got out and was missing for a week. How do I train cats to stay by me or be able to be indoor or outdoor?,208,aww
This kind of blew up! I own the rights to the photo but credit must be given to our family photographer. She gets the most beautiful pics of my kid and pets. @caseyraephoto on instagram,483,aww
My parents had a cat named CJ when I was born. This cat loved me and I loved the cat. My grandmother said that when she came to help my mom after they came home from the hospital with me, CJ didn't leave her alone with me if my mom was out of the room. CJ just sat directly in front of my grandmother and starred her down.When I was able to sleep with CJ and not risk suffocation, my parents say she allowed me to treat her like a stuffed animal.The story of CJ is one of a truck stop box kitten. Somewhere on the side of a California highway, my dad heard her call.,87,aww
I’ve heard Calicos are sweet. I thought it was a saying, but each calico I have met is loving and affectionate.,186,aww
You printed and framed that, right? Right?,76,aww
This picture is taken by a professional photographer . Really good picture. The cat, the boy, the lake/river. Truly amazing,30,aww
She has a “tortitude”. We have a fat tortie as well, and she ONLY loves my 9yo son, she will kill anyone else with a look, but runs to his bed and waits for him and even will bath his head, blech The tortitude in tortishell cats is truth.,21,aww
It seems like they are two old souls who haven’t seen each other in some time.Beautiful.,47,aww
Well I must share about my Ollie.  He was born March 23rd of this year.  I got him from the Human Society.  He was fostered from his 2nd day of birth.  Neutered.So.  He has this thing he does.  He burrows his head into my neck and just stays there.  Purrs and drools.  Yes that's right: drools *like a river* drools.  During the whole time I am talking sweet to him...very softly.  This lasts about 5 minutes and afterwards?  My whole shirt is soaked.  At his 1st year appt w/Vet?  I asked her about it thinking something was wrong.  She got this softest look in her face and said "he just really, really loves you" and I know it.  When I cut his nails?  He stays still and if I look down at him?  He is looking deep into my eyes w/this look of trust that's unnerved me.  I love Ollie.  Sadly, he won't sleep w/me at night.  I used to yell at him "I'm going to get a dog Ollie that will sleep w/me" or "Okay, we're getting another cat".  Not even threats worked, lol.  So I ran into a friend who's foster cat (6mos) was terrorizing her two very small dogs.  As she described it: my little dogs used to walk around w/their tails waging and happy and after the kitten started wanting to play...they walked around w/their tails down and fearful every minute.  I felt so bad and I thought Ollie and I could use another.........So now I also have Mr. Baby.  He was taken from a hoarder (62 cats) and was so covered w/fleas they couldn't tell he was a Ginger.  He and Ollie and best of buds. Sadly?  Mr. Baby doesn't like sleeping w/me either, lmao.  Oh well.  I've adjusted.  hahahahaThanks for letting me share.,20,aww
My cat, Snuggles, was my best friend in the whole world. She stumbled into my life when I was 2 years old and she was a tiny abandoned kitten from a factory. She had made it all the way across the main road just to find us.We had the best adventures! We would go to space in Rockets out of cardboard boxes, Report the news on tv’s out of cardboard boxes, we made our own dens and went camping in the front room, we would sit outside in the rain under a huge umbrella on top of the coal bunker thinking about our next adventure together. She was the best cat in the world. Your little boy is going to have the most wonderful memories of his lovely friend.,18,aww
Good boy.  Good girl.,15,aww
They remind me of Calvin and Hobbs.,15,aww
This is the kind of picture that goes on your mantle for life.,13,aww

Sorta reminds me of Grawp from Harry Potter. Imagine having this thing around that's twice your size and very clumsy, but you know it's full of love and doesn't mean you any harm.,12,aww

This pic reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes :),8,aww
This is some Calvin and Hobbes shit right here,7,aww
I love this so much.I have a tortilla (<---oh, I'm definitely leaving that AC. I meant tortie!) and she is verrrrrrry anti-social. A lot of my friends didn't even know I had her because she would always hide and only be cuddly with me when we were alone. (rescue kitty. must have had some issues when teeny tiny. ☹️)When she was 4 years old, I met someone and when she came over to my place, I warned her that one of my cats would hide and it had nothing to do with her. Well, what a surprise. The minute she saw her, she climbed on her lap and put her cute little paws around her neck and got really cozy. I couldn't believe it.Fast forward. It's now 10 years later and that someone is now my wife and her and my tortie have been the bestest of buds since. I have loads of pics over the years like [this](http://imgur.com/a/kXZNeiW) from my wife. 😺Seeing your 2 babies like this makes me so dang happy. Also, high five to adopting an adult kitty. I wish more people would.,5,aww
Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.,7,aww
Damn, that’s adorable.,6,aww
I got 2 kittens the week I got my PTSD grandkids to raise. Those cats trained the kids by scratching when needed and now the cats get hauled all over the place just like the OP's cat. They are both sleeping with one that has a pretty high fever now. They are best buds in a way they'll never be with me.,6,aww
IRL Calvin and Hobbes?,5,aww
That shit better be in a picture frame on the wall!!!,5,aww
I dont normally get choked up. When I do its because I am reminded that I cant see my best friend. When I was a small boy I had a tortishell cat as well. We were pretty inseperable. Playing mario? right there on my shoulder. Homework? Right there on the desk. Always stayed at the foot of the bed. Would meow when I got up. One of those rare intelligent cats that would walk outside or stay with you no matter what. Would hiss if you tried leaving without saying goodbye. She put up with a lot of shit too. Unlike your son I have no pictures. especially ones like this. I would trade everything I have and more, not a single sacrifice I wouldnt make if I could spend just one more day with my friend. I dont normally care for photos but really like this one and if your son even feels half of what I did by the time I was 11 (my cat was old by then so we all know what happens) then he will really, realy appreciate you took this for him. To each their own but I wouldnt show this to him until later in life though. Safe from the teenage angst and all that.,5,aww
I didn't expect much love from my cat to my son. She was always just irritated that my belly kept kicking at her when she laid there. We came home from the hospital with him, and she was intrigued. She always checked him out. Eventually he started to try crawling and eventually she started getting right in front of him and wiggling her tail. Like she was playing with him. She got him to follow her around so much.And now they're damn near best friends. He makes her little cardboard box condos and sneaks her food. She doesn't have to add to the friendship. He's happy his cat loves him.,4,aww
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen in a while, and it has given me the warm fuzzies 😍,4,aww

Reminds me of my childhood cat. She was so patient with me it was like having a third parent around. It’s good to see others sharing the same bond!,5,aww
Anything the light touches is yours! What about that place ?That is the vacuum cleaner  closet, you should never go there !,4,aww
How adorable! Little ones and cats are two of the cutest things in my book, and I LOVE cats and babies together!! Reminds me of my dear cat who I picked from the shelter at age 3. She remained with us for 10 years before dying from some sort of stomach issues. I miss her every day :( Nothing like the bond between a child and cat!,4,aww
I recently had to have my cat put down because he got hit by a car, might sound crazy but he was the only thing keeping me sane when I first got him, wasn’t in a great place, bought him back home with me to live with the whole family and he’s been so loved by all of us, this picture Just brings back so many happy memories ❤️Thanks for sharing 😌,5,aww
She a tortie, of course she's tolerant and loving.,4,aww
Humans do not choose their cats...Cats choose their humans.BASTET BE PRAISED!,4,aww
Why do my cats suck? They hate my kids and hit them as they walk by. I wish my cats and kids had this kind of relationship.,4,aww
So adorable! ❤️,3,aww
This is adorable,3,aww
This is the purest thing in the world,3,aww
Some animals just know. It’s a wonderful thing,3,aww
You are a great photographer,3,aww
My dad's cat adopted me when I was born, would always climb into bed with me at night to keep watch.,3,aww
This is adorable on a level that I am not sure if I know how to express....now I must go find one of my cats and hug it till it hates me,3,aww
Amazing picture. He’ll love this when he’s older,3,aww
I think some cats recognize the difference between children and adults. My cat has put up with all kinds of bullshit from me when I was little, 3 kittens, and a puppy. He always uses a softer touch when dealing with babies.,3,aww
Our tortie passed last year. This picture made me smile thinking of our beloved little kitty. She would have loved our baby.,3,aww
Your son has loved \*his\* cat. Not your cat anymore bud, sorry.,3,aww
One time when I was in highschool I was waiting just outside the school and a kitty cat from one of the nearby suburbs came over to me and sat next to me at the curb while I waited for my bus to go home. I was on an I.E.P. and I got out earlier than everyone else. For a few more days after that, the same kitty sat next to me in the same spot while I sat at the curb of the sidewalk. One time when the bus came, the kitty wanted to get on the bus with me. I felt horrible, the kitty gave me the sad kitten eyes.,3,aww
This picture genuinely makes me emotional and I have no clue why 😭,3,aww
Anyone else get a total "Calvin and Hobbes" vibe here? Love it!,3,aww
Please enlarge and frame this picture and hang it up in your house. It's so precious 😭❤️,3,aww
Any chance your son's name is Calvin and your cat's name is Hobbes? :)Thank you for sharing this beautiful photo!,3,aww
Excellent picture. You should blow it up and get it framed.,3,aww
I rescued a stray cat, super cute, beautiful blue eyes. She walks around out house but wont get near us, she starts complaining as soon as we get a few feet away. Recently, a couple with two girls moved in the house next to mine. My cat wont stop following them around and taking care of them when they are outside playing. She lets them grab her and rub her belly. Im pretty sure cars know they are children and are super gentle to them. I love cats, so damn much. They are perfect little creatures.,3,aww
Man, this was me and my cat growing up. She was a barn cat, wild as all get out. But she'd just sit and chill with me. Even into my pre-teens. RIP Evinrude. Named her after the brand of outboard motors cause her purr was so loud. Thanks for bringing back some good memories, OP.,3,aww
I love this picture a lot.,3,aww
"Tolerates that love"OP knows cats,3,aww
When treated gently, kitties treat our young as if it’s their own. They love and snuggle, spend time, and stand guard during illness; and teach their owners about the limits of power.Cats really are a wonderful.,3,aww
Look at the scenery together,3,aww
I had a similar cat when I was born. She could stare people down from sitting in her chair, but treated me like the most important thing in the house. The first time I was allowed to get up and make my own cereal bowl, she ran back and forth from me to my parents meowing at them until she was told I was allowed.She treated me like her little brother.,3,aww
That's not tolerance. The cat loves him, too.,3,aww
Wow. I left my cat with my parents when I moved in with my allergic husband. The first time I brought my baby over the cat took one look and disappeared. I basically never saw him again (he was fine to be clear, just hiding from the scary baby).,3,aww
This picture does things to me,3,aww
...Yep, and now I'm totally regretting not having a son and not having a cat right now, don't mind me, I'm just muddling my way through the front pages here, excuse me...,3,aww
I haven't seen my cat in 4 months and I fly home from Uni in a week and this post has made me so excited to see her.,3,aww
This is the perfect photo. It reminds me so much of my best friend of over 20 years.,3,aww

Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.,3,aww
This picture is heart warming! We had cats all my life (i'm 21) and I couldn't imagine my life without cats. They can be so loving and cuddly. Don't get me wrong.. Sometimes cats can be little brats but they still show a lot of love.,3,aww
I used to have this kind of relationship with my first cat. She used to climb up on my shoulders or follow me around and we would talk to each other. I was so sad when she got older and was starting to go, she was so strong. At the age of 18 she passed away while I was stationed in South Korea. When I’m having a rough day I sometimes can see her in the corner of my vision.,3,aww
This is a real life Calvin and Hobbes. You need to start a comic based on this taking photos of the two and photo shopping in dialog bubbles,3,aww
I have a young son and we had an old orange tabby girl named Jaffe who just really took to him.  Even as she got very old and sick, she'd perk up when he'd come around and they'd play for hours with this little glitter wand with tinsel at the end.Every night, before bed, he'd get his "Jaffe snuggles".  We all miss her very much.Thanks for posting this.,3,aww
Son: Gee, Cat, what do you want to do tonight?Cat: The same thing we do every night, kid - try to take over the world!,3,aww
This comment will probably get buried but any chance you could like to a full size image somewhere? I'd love to set this as my desktop background :),3,aww

Looks like my former cat “taco” rip taco, your tail was ripped off while sleeping in my moms car when she started it. you made it 10 years while in the process of fighting off other cats that came onto our property. bro disappeared one day and even at that young age i knew what happened. rip bro. haven’t owned a cat since,2,aww

Good god I think I just grew an ovary.  I love this photo so much.,2,aww
We had a cat when I was growing up that would let you poke it. “Cuddle it” and generally mess with it until you were about 5. Then it decided you were smart enough to know better and would hiss or swat to  stop you.,2,aww
My favorite cats I’ve had growing up were a calico and a tortoise shell. I’ve had a couple tabbies and a siamese, but they were never as loving and personable as my calico and torti were.,2,aww

God I love this picture so much,2,aww
My family has had the same line of cats for 22 years. They started from a stray barn cat from my uncle and soon enough we had a heard of pure white fluff balsa every couple years. Each time some would get lost or die a new litter cam from the cat literally called mama. She died when I was 7. I had her last done a big hulk of a cat who yelled constantly and could bruise my young body. He eventually went missing when I was 11. We thought that was it for the white cats, then our neighbor told us a stray cat took his garage from him. She had 3 tiny little white kittens with her. The two that survived became the two cats I have today. They are more loyal and loving then most dogs and have been a major part of my life. Once their gone that will be it and I'm not ready for that.,2,aww
Both my mind and my heart calm down at the first look,2,aww
She found her human. Love this so much,2,aww
Must be bubbles when he was kid,2,aww
You’ve got to blow this photo up and hang it with a nice frame!,2,aww

Cat's are funny. We have an elderly cat, that I is.. let's say... stubborn, vocal, and overall just not very pleasant, but she's getting old so I cut her some slack. My 8m/o daughter can do absolutely anything to her, and she will just chill and take it, purr away, and then come back for more a few minutes later.,2,aww
This picture is the best most sweetest piece of happy Ive seen today..,2,aww
Is that a /r/torties I see? Hard to tell from this distance,2,aww

Literally cutest picture ever!,1,aww
This picture just made me tear up. I have cat I’ve had for three years now and he’s the best little friend I could ask for. I hope if I have children one day, he will bond with them just like your son and fur baby.,1,aww
The best picture ever,1,aww

Congratulations your cat is meme worthy,1,aww
Why does that cat not move?,1,aww
That is such a beautiful picture! From a fellow cat owner and parent, this fully warms my heart. I love to see how my cats love my daughter. 💕,1,aww
Heart melted. So sweet!,1,aww
I am wondering what your son is saying to the kitty right now "like what if cat was really spelled D-O-G?",1,aww
This is adorable,1,aww
He is pure and she is evil, together they are Pure Evil.,1,aww
Oh my heart....,1,aww
Great photo,1,aww
Quite possibly one of the most touching photos I've ever seen and I know nothing about your family, yet I feel like your family is loving and close just seeing those two.,1,aww
Reminds me of our son and two cats.   Very awesome.,1,aww
This is so beautiful. I can’t wait to have my own children one day and get to experience the kids and the cats forming adorable bonds like this.,1,aww
In the words of Chandler "could this picture be any cuter?",1,aww
This picture is so nicely taken.,1,aww
r/torties,1,aww
This is so heartwarming. You were able to capture some amazing quality photos you’ll treasure for a lifetime. And this is coming from a non cat person. Lol,1,aww
This made me cry because it so adorable! Beautiful picture!,1,aww
My heart 😭💝,1,aww
Tolerate is the operating word here lol,1,aww

catdog,1,aww
That's so beautiful. Fantastic pic,1,aww
Gorgeous Calico!,1,aww
Classic cat. Doesn't love you back, just tolerates your love. I love cats.,1,aww
So cute!!,1,aww
i think your cat is an especially nice and patient cat, and your son is lucky to have her. my daughter has loved our cat since the day she was born, but he just doesn't give a shit. ㅠㅜ,1,aww
Amazing. I’ve currently got my 3 week old boy on a pillow to my side and my 7 year old tort on my lap. This photo is my dream for them. First fur, first human... becoming best friends. This is confirmation of what I want for those two. Thanks for sharing.,1,aww
Oh the cuteness!!!,1,aww
I noticed how most cats are super gentle with toddlers, even when they are being unruly and playing rough. The cat would just tap it a few times with paws, never pulling out the claws and scratch.,1,aww
I love this so damn much. I have a cat who is my whole world, and my husband and I are going to try to have children soon. I can only dream that my future child will have a relationship with my cat like this.,1,aww
Calvin and Hobbs,1,aww
Lovely cat. Reminds me on my Freya. 😭😭😭 miss her so much,1,aww
I had a similar cat protector as a kid, name was black cat. I hope they have a lot of really fun adventures!,1,aww
My cat has always loved my son like this. He’s super protective and always follows him around outside. 🙂,1,aww
Your cat thinks your son is the family pretty.,1,aww
This ..is ..beautiful..sir.,1,aww
That’s a keeper,1,aww
That's your son, but he's HER boy.  My late cat loved my son with a passion as they grew up together.  It is sweet as can be.,1,aww
This is beautiful.,1,aww
[reminds me of this album cover](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4185572700_5.jpg),1,aww
If I was a parent and a pet died that my child loved I would have absolutely no clue how to deal with that. I guess thats why we have reddit. Sorry for being sad or whatnot,1,aww
A boy and his cat.,1,aww
That picture - wow. Forever a family heirloom. You  love it now, but can’t even begin to imagine what it will mean to you later. I promise.,1,aww
Awesome click... I also clicked my daughter's pics ND video with 3 kitty on backyard,1,aww
I grew up with a tortie who looks a lot like your girl. She was one of the sweetest, smartest, sassiest cats I've ever known. If I was crying, she would find me and comfort me. When my mom yelled at me and my brother, she would bite my mom on the ankle. She passed away when I was 10 years old, 8 days past her 21st birthday. She had a good, happy life, and was a staple of our family. I'm glad that your son gets to grow up with such a good companion.,1,aww
Reminds me of my old cat. Myself I am now 13 but my family had a tortoise shell tabby until last year. She was around even before I was born so she was like my sister and I’s older sister. She was very tolerant of everything we did. We pick her up and hug her for minutes and when we were done she would just hop on down and walk somewhere nearby and have a nap.,1,aww
Those suspenders are fackin cute,1,aww
/r/AccidentalRenaissance,1,aww
This really is the sweetest,1,aww
Come up with a funny caption, and you have a million-dollar greeting card,1,aww
That's such a nice picture.,1,aww
I hope this is both your cat and your son, what a lovely photo&#x200B;,1,aww
*flashbacks from Of Mice and Men*,1,aww
That's how animals love. Unconditionally.,1,aww
Lovely photo!,1,aww
Warm and fuzzies,1,aww
Torties are the best! So much personality.,1,aww
Fuck I miss my cat 😢,1,aww
My kitty Momo tolerated my siblings and I as grabby toddlers, but totally loved us any way. Our family was lucky to have 21 great years with him.,1,aww
He's going to be a very good person.,1,aww
upvotes for everyone!!!!!,1,aww
People tout dogs as the most affectionate, which is true... But you either have to earn a cat's love or it has to just..know...that you're worth loving,1,aww
Such a beautiful image. Thank you for sharing, made my day better :),1,aww
Animals are great as long as they are treated right and loved they'll treat you right and love you back. Great picture,1,aww
Plot twist: OP is the cat,1,aww
Toddlers in suspenders are always adorable.,1,aww
This is something that I hang to my wall,1,aww
Omg, you cannot stage that.,1,aww
This reminds of that scene from Inception except there’s a little boy and cat instead of a little boy and girl,1,aww
Welp, time to add this to the list of cats that can never die,1,aww
That's living.,1,aww
That is indeed a fantastic picture!,1,aww
Aww, so cute.,1,aww
What a perfect shot. So many cats grow up with babies and children, and you think the cat must hate being dragged and hugged and dressed up, but they love it. They love their person unconditionally. They tolerate the grabby little hands and grow to love them forever. As your son grows up the cat will love him even more and its beautiful.,1,aww
Cats are the most wonderful creatures. I've never had a cat that wasn't filled with love and personality. These are beautiful pictures, thank you,1,aww

I'd be nervous, too, if I was going to be trained to unquestioningly obey a handler who would order me into situations that were too dangerous to risk a human officer's life, like I was some sort of expendable drone or robot.  Seriously though, police "K9 units" are morally indefensible.,-204,aww

I imagine that dog saying "Hey buddy, I said you needed to look after my baby. Here take him again I am heading out back for a while",323,aww
I watched this gif while poopin' and right as the doggo put the toy down my kitten put her little paws up on my leg and just looked at me as if to say, "take note, human"  I'll put my phone in my pocket after this comment and pet her.  Then I'll finish poopin',67,aww

"Aww, adorable!! Now fuck off, I'm gonna get HUGE internet points with this.",2,aww
Put the laptop down for a long time. My dog died last year and he used to "bug" me like this. Mostly I put the laptop down but I still regret the few times I didn't.,2,aww
As an owner of two dogs if they are acting like this it means I am not giving them enough attention. I have to ask myself, why do I have dogs if I don't want to play with them? Then I have to ask myself, why am I on the computer when these dogs want to show me how much they love me?,2,aww
Play with that dog this second!,2,aww
awwww this is so cute. haven't logged in for a bit but once I saw this... oh wait. kinda against the point, no? ah well. cute dog lifted my spirits for the day so lemme know if you ever need a dogsitter. or director of marketing so you can spend more time with this awesome friend of yours :),2,aww
This is my dog with my phone everytime I get home. The initial greeting is never enough and my phone is evil for taking away precious Eevee(my dog) attention.,2,aww
And how many little children feel that way?  Are stories still read at bedtime?  Are babies rocked to sleep?  I hope so.,2,aww
The fur is so shiny 😍,2,aww
I thought this was a risky click until I saw what subreddit this was from.,2,aww
And just like that r/aww has a new all-time top post!,2,aww
its sad,2,aww
Awwww cutest way to ask to play,2,aww
Why this video has been posted to the r/awww and not to the r/lifestruggle? I mean,it's cute to watch it, but if you experience it daily well you feel a little pinch 😜,2,aww
Dogs are the greatest thing we ever discovered as a species. I say that with 100% conviction.,2,aww
Awwwwwww,2,aww
It gets cuter everytime i watch it,2,aww
I just said "oh good boy, GOOD BOY" out loud, and involuntarily.,2,aww
This is sooo cute! it reminds me of my own dog who rubs against my leg like a cat when he wants attention :D,2,aww
Take this toy as a token of my appreciation, human,3,aww
I'm sure he wouldn't do that if it was Reddit instead of Facebook,3,aww
That's a very happy and healthy pupper, such a shiny coat,3,aww
And you just happen to be recording video.,3,aww
[removed],3,aww
You kinda have to at this point.,1,aww
/u/bexnoodles19,1,aww
My dog does this, except he tries to bite the corner of my laptop.,1,aww
Doggo does an irl meme,1,aww
this is absolutely adorable,1,aww
It's ironic. Your dog tells you to leave the internet and at the same time your dog wins the internet for you. Congrats!,1,aww
"John close your fucking laptop... Now.. Throw this toy for me",1,aww
When bae wants to "try out a new toy.",1,aww
This is best thing I saw today!,1,aww

Awww :)My mom's dog is a bit less tactful. She squeezes herself under my arm to go sit on my lap to push the laptop off.,1,aww

In this case, its a retorical question.,1,aww
Well that's bloody adorable.,1,aww

Thats a thing of beauty.God I love dogs. Give him a hug from me.,1,aww
Wiiii,1,aww
I went to hug my dog after :3,1,aww
Ha! My dog does the same!,1,aww

Look at me!,1,aww
Okay :),1,aww
>"Leave the internet and come play with me."(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),1,aww
That laptop though! E5510? One a my faves.,1,aww
I instinctively repeated "pup pup" after watching this.,1,aww
Haha that's great! As soon as I turn off my desktop for the night, my dog runs up from where she's been hiding and looks at me longingly! :),1,aww
Cute Doggo level over 9000!,1,aww
Wow she looks exactly like my dog. Calla https://imgur.com/gallery/GYSPK,1,aww
Dogs are too good. We don't deserve them.,1,aww
My heart just grew two sizes.,1,aww
This is a SUPERB PUP! I take it you don't make him/her subject to a ball machine. Human interaction for the win :D ❤️,1,aww
Or you could film the dog and put it on the internet...,1,aww
how the hell on earth they do it,1,aww
Wow dogs are so intelligent!,1,aww
And I shall,1,aww
"I've been a good boy, come play",1,aww
My best buddy will do this all day when I pickup my Playstation controller :),1,aww
Fucking aww!,1,aww

All the feels,1,aww
Maybe he was just jealous that you were checking out other people's dogs on their Facebook wall,1,aww
You play with him right now!,1,aww
"Dammit, Barbara. You've been home for FIVE minutes. What do I have to do to get a little family time?!",1,aww
The message is loud and clear.,1,aww
For fucks sake take down your tree man!,1,aww
Sooo cute,1,aww
Okay!  I'll be right there!,1,aww
Impossible to say no,1,aww
Most of your pet's life is spent waiting for you to pay attention.,1,aww
Go play with them dammit,1,aww
This made me smile :),1,aww
A thousand times this. There's been a bunch of times where I'll be messing around on my phone, look down at my dog and think "I've got this crazy, interactive thing right here in front of me. I should be playing with *that*.",1,aww
come on please,1,aww
Dogs are the best,1,aww
PLAY WITH THE PUPPY!!!,1,aww
Do it, hooman.,1,aww
This is a sign for all Redditors that have a dog. Get off Reddit and go play with your dog.,1,aww

Cute baby!! Lucky you! 🤘🏻,1,aww
I unexpectedly got nostalgic with that because I had that toy as a kid, I got if from McDonalds if I'm not mistaken, and I fucking loved the little plushy.,1,aww
I love dogs,1,aww
If this dog isn't being playing, someone is going to get in trouble,1,aww

You will miss him when it dies. Play fetch now!,1,aww
That's the sweetest thing I've seen all day!!!,1,aww

lapdog,1,aww
I was ignoring my own puppy while reading Reddit until I saw this. GO PLAY WITH YOUR DOG! They're only with us for a short time and they have so much love to share.,1,aww
As much as I'd love to have a pet, this is why I don't get one. I simply wouldn't be in the mood to play with it 85% of the time.I wish there was like a humane, on-demand, 'Rent-a-Pet' service.,1,aww
I recognize that toy from a McDonel happy meal a few years ago,1,aww
Poor baby!!,1,aww
My dog will randomly paw at me to pet her while playing COD.  As soon as I do someone comes around and jacks me. I try to wait till intermission but she is too cute.,1,aww
If anyone else did that I would be madBut in this case I would be like dam that was pretty cool, sure I will play,1,aww
Look at that shiny coat!, he must get a lot of eggs,1,aww

My man heart just exploded.  Play with them!!!,1,aww

shut down your facebook and go play with that dog, you cruel inhuman person!,1,aww
That's fucking adorable.,1,aww
Aww..this is such a sweet video. I got really scared at first. from the title I thought it was about a pedofile telling a little girl on the internet to go "play"with him in real life.,1,aww
I wonder if he able to play with his dog or continued *interneting* after posting this.,1,aww
This dog knows what's up! (Y),1,aww
Its all cute when the dog does it, but when your wife says it.....*starts crying*,1,aww
It looks like you were looking at the Facebook profile of someone who is now married. Maybe your dog is trying to say "Get over her/him. You still have me",1,aww
You go pet that dog now!,1,aww
Wait till he knocks the controller outta your hands while you're trying to capture C,1,aww
I've hand-trained ferrets fresh from their pre-human pack, I've never had one go back to hurting once they know that you simply aren't as tough as them.With dogs and cats, I will put my hand into their mouths when they are highest energy, let em chew me up to the point of discomfort and make a sad/hurt sound. The little lovelies correct, every time. =*DIf only humans were so empathetic and responsive,1,aww
Any time my kitties do this I always drop whatever technology I'm looking at and play.,1,aww
who can say no to him!,1,aww
Proceeds to take out phone to record video, opens laptop back up and posts video for internet points.,1,aww
This is my cats every morning except its my bed and not the internet,1,aww

Cute,1,aww
my pup does something similar. if I'm sitting on the couch or something and am on my phone, he'll stick his head under my hands and try to push my phone away so I'll give him pats,1,aww
This literally made me aww out loud,1,aww
Such a good doggo.,1,aww
This made my morning. :),1,aww
D'awwI'm a little sad now since my little boy doesn't have much of a yard and the temperature actually hurt his paw ;-;,1,aww
My 2 year old will do that.  Makes me feel like a bad mom, but I always play with him when he does it.,1,aww
Let's play! Woooooooooooooo hoooooooo!,1,aww
Holy fuck that's cute.,1,aww
This reminds me of the end of Unfriended.Did anyone else watch Unfriended? It was a fairly average movie. Unique, but average.,1,aww
Wow I can tell that dog really loves you, you must be a really good owner. Nice jobs dude.,1,aww
My dog knocks the phone out of my hand when I'm screwing around on Reddit.,1,aww
Can someone please tell me what kind of dog that is?,1,aww
The way he just closes that laptop and gets up in your face with the toy how can you say no to that? :),1,aww
Go play ya heartless bastard!,1,aww
More dogs should do this.,1,aww
That toy is such a throwback, I'm gonna say happy meal?,1,aww
Our dogs do this to us all the time. They use their paws to close the laptop on us. We give them plenty of attention but they never seem to get enough lol.,1,aww
I can't say no to that face. >_<,1,aww
I really needed that after watching that video on /r/rage,1,aww
One cannot leave the internet,1,aww
I hope you went and played with your dog mate ;),1,aww
What kind of dog is that?,1,aww
That's a good boy.,1,aww
"Excuse me sir, have you heard of the church of fetch?",1,aww
How could ANYONE say no to that???,1,aww
*[SAW Horror Movie Theme Plays](https://youtu.be/hWaNoK3gN6M)* - I want to play a game.  In front of you is my toy, all you have to do is throw it and I'll fetch it.  However, it's covered in dog slober.  You have 2 minutes.  You can either grab it, slobber and all, or I will shit on your laptop when you're gone.  The choice is yours.,1,aww
I need a dog like this,1,aww
This is exactly what my girlfriend does.,1,aww
This gif could break the internet,1,aww
You better stop reading this comment right now and go play fetch. ^(You're still here? Did I stutter?),1,aww
damit! that is so adorable,1,aww
cutest thing ever,1,aww
Reminds me of a story from when me, my brother, and my sister were playing a game of Risk on the floor. Here we were in the middle of game when, all of the sudden, our cat pushes the game box right over the board, messing up all the pieces. I mean cats will often wreck games by wanting to play *with* the pieces, but actually pushing the box through all the pieces was something new. It was too funny for any of us to be upset.,1,aww
Play with the dog you evil bastard,1,aww
What type of dog is this?! My girlfriend and I have a dog that almost looks like its twin and we can't pin a breed down at all. We know she's part whippet, but can't get any other parts figured out.,1,aww
Why do you still have your christmas tree up? :p,1,aww
So cute!!!,1,aww
I feel like this dog is a life coach. "Stop working so hard. Stop doing mindless stuff online. Let's go have fun!",1,aww
My dog does this except he'll jump up and sit on my hands as I'm trying to work,1,aww
and this is why i cant have a dog. they are too needy and i dont want to waste the little free time i have to take care.,1,aww
Been sick and laid up last couple days with a cold and this made me smile/cough/sneeze/smile.  Love the dogg-o's :),1,aww
"Stop messing with my facebook page",1,aww
How could you possibly refuse.,1,aww
Adorable!,1,aww
My jack Russel does this to my phone, she jumps up onto my lap and pushes my phone (out of my hand sometimes) with her snout till my hand where she wants me to stroke annoyingly cute,1,aww
Omg, I don't care if I was in the middle of an email to my boss.  I must obey!  Plus by closing it you probably just put it into hibernation anyway.,1,aww
My cat would just stand in front of the screen.  "Try ignoring me now.",1,aww
Baum - Game will launch at $60.  Just kidding :).  Looking to charge 5 to 10 bucks.  It will be early access so I can collect feedback and improve the graphics.  The mechanics has been my main focus, so some of what you see is placeholder or will be iterated on.Shades - totally get what you're saying, and I have some good plans to make you truly feel like a space wizard, not just pixel NMS.,1,aww
this dog is so polite.  Carefully closes the laptop and puts a small toy on it to play.My dog would launch a tennis ball across the room, bound after it crashing into wall and cats, grab it and run full speed and jump his 60lbs ass in my lap.It hurts.  But its cute so I allow it.,1,aww
PLAY, YOU MONSTER, PLAY WITH EM!!!!,1,aww
I'd much rather play with my dog than ever spend any time on facebook.,1,aww
We should all get off the internet and go play with OP's dog.,1,aww
Aww! lolHe's like, "Dude, c'mon, you have a responsibility as an owner to play with me.",1,aww
 I want this puppers,1,aww
I want a dog.,1,aww
So he posts it on the internet... dog 0, Internet 1,1,aww
This is a good reminder to take a break from the screen time and pay attention to what matters.,1,aww
omg this. this is adorbs,1,aww
I wouldn't be able to say no!,1,aww
My heart just melted.,1,aww
Puppers: If I can't beat internet, I will become internet...transformation complete.,1,aww
I have a friend, or should I say acquaintance, who has a dog like this. Just last night we were playing overwatch and, over xbox live, I heard him say to the dog "if you dont stop licking my controller, I am going to break your neck."  I just don't understand how someone can be like that! He shouldn't be a pet owner.,1,aww
[deleted]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6119  > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/45584),1,aww

Nobody hates the internet more than dogs.,1,aww
Ahahah tira sta palla bastardo,1,aww
"Thats enough cat videos, remember why dogs r good?",1,aww

"Hello sir, can I introduce you to the church of DOG?!",1,aww

Thank you for this. My cousin’s son has Downs. From birth, he hated strangers. When I first met him, he was almost a year old. My family said “don’t be discouraged if he doesn’t want to be around you.” The whole family surprised me at the airport and brought him. He surprised everyone by reaching for me immediately... and every moment after, he stuck to me like glue. He had this thing that he’d do with me and no one else (then or ever since) where he’d yell “ahhhhhhh” and lick my face. I’d tilt him over where his head was almost on the ground and he’d giggle like crazy and I’d lift him up straight and he’d yell again and lick my face and giggle until I’d lean him over again. It was Christmas week and I ended up being the person he chose to sit on my lap and open his presents. When he was 3 or so, I moved down there. I rented a room from family and he’d yell “KNO KNO” Like “knock knock” without the “k” and then stick his toes and fingers under my bedroom door. When he was convinced I had seen them, he’d bust open my door and climb in my bed and point to the tv. I could just continue doing my computer work while he watched cartoons in my bed as long as I let him wear my pajama pants as a scarf. Every time I looked over, he’d give me a huge grin. I haven’t been down there in 5 years or so. But I miss that kid so much.,4693,aww
I have a sister with downs and her mental capacity has declined so much of as late. This brings tears to my eyes because I know the beautiful heart she has and how she used to express it. I miss the love she used to show so much. Lately she barely acknowledges me. Thank you for making that loving gesture to your brother. His reaction is priceless.,7331,aww
So sweet! :) I have older sister with Downs. She's 37 now and I could not be more proud of her. She is so independent, she know how to read, write, sing, playing zither and much more. She can even prepare food on her own. &nbsp;It is important how much time do you spend teaching Downs people  in early life. My mother did a fantastic job; she pretty much dedicated her life for my sister. When she was born, doctors said that she won't be able to do any of those thing she can do it now. But my mother prove them wrong big time ! :),1125,aww
Your bro is absolutely rocking that beard.,4460,aww
Well... here's another human with more courage than me, because I am too scared to hold a delicate baby.,15515,aww
The picture on the right brings a tear to my eye, such an amazing photo.Those with DS are some of the most loving human beings on this planet, and your photos show that perfectly.Thank you for sharing these awesome photos! <3,467,aww
My son's not a baby anymore and he's sleeping now, but I had to go into his room and hold him for a moment and tell him I love him after seeing this.  I'm still crying.  I've had a pretty brutal month in a lot of ways and I didn't realize how much I needed this.Thank you for reminding me that love is something we all share and that we all need; that it's not complication and suffering and labor and hardship and duty; that it's simple and pure and joyful and fragile and the most important thing in life.  I need to love more like your brother does.  I think we all do.,1750,aww
Show him love for as long as he lives. Help him solve the little problems. I had a cousin with Downs that was not expected to live past 21. She lived into her 60's with love from the family. She learned to write her name and recognize some words. Her focus was amazing. I miss her.,13890,aww
Wow thank you Reddit! I'm legitimately choked up at all the kind things you internet strangers said. I wish I could communicate all of it to him. I'm really touched and can't wait to show my parents all the uplifting comments. 100% chance my mom will start sobbing in a good way (there is more rejection for him as an adult because maybe he is fidgety in public or does a number on someone's toilet 😂 etc. So with all the encouragement I bet she is going to be so torn up). I think you just gave her the best Christmas present ever. Thank you all a million times! Really, I had no idea so many people would be so goddamn nice.Note: I never actually heard the term downsie in a derogatory way but I can see how that might be a thing. I thought it was an affectionate reference. I hope it's obvious from the context it is meant to be loving.,7803,aww
This post is too pure for this world. So much love for you and your family.,4090,aww
keep showing him the love!!,76,aww
This made me sob on my toilet. Can't wait to show it to my fiancé when I get out of here.,354,aww
I HAVE A BABY YOU CAN HOLD DAMMIT.,169,aww
Aw man. This makes me wish/ want to put in more effort to make a positive difference in someone's life everyday. Have my upvote.,55,aww
Thank you for sharing this joy to the us all, what a beautiful thing to see. I’m sure he’ll be the best uncle & he will do so with such pride,94,aww
I would have cried. Congrats on the baby and congrats on having such an amazing brother.,318,aww
Oh my god man. Love him, he is the best there is. Thank you for sharing this, im going to wipe my tears now, man up and wait until evening to hug my daughter.,44,aww
This instantly made me cry! So sweet ❤️😭,38,aww
This is so perfect. Definitely an r/aww with some extra awwwwwwwww,38,aww
Okay I'm officially done interneting now.  That second pic - I can't.  So pure and beautiful....,39,aww
Fucking cute. Both of them.You can totally *feel* the love coming through the screen. Awesome pics. Warmed my old, cold heart right up and made my evening. Probably the day tomorrow, too.,90,aww
I especially love the one on the right. The way your bro is so tender, and holding her so carefully - but still gets in the good snuggle and (presumably) a whiff of freshly clean baby. Ahh. Gotta love him💕,58,aww
Reddit doesn’t deserve this much love, but thank you for raising awareness for downs. I almost cried at the line “...it’s rare someone lets him now.” What a travesty! People with disabilities, let alone downs, are some of the sweetest people on Earth. My brother has downs too and no matter what I’ll always believe he has to be the most down to earth person I know; he’s very kind to anyone he meets and happy to help in anyway. Shame on anyone who discriminated against people with mental disabilities.,427,aww
I just had a daughter days ago... If the stars aligned I would let him hold her. The scope of life quickly changes when visceral love is involved. Long live happy people and humanity.,24,aww
This warms my cold, dark heart.,23,aww
Every baby should be cuddled like that, and everyone should get to cuddle a baby like that. So much love in these photos.,69,aww
That is so sweet! My autistic brother, who is also low functioning, likes to pet animals but he likes to push the skin on their heads back so their eyelids lift off their eyeballs so he can look under their eyelids. It’s super creepy and I stop him every time he does it but the animals keep coming back for it so it must not bother them too much. We used to have a cat that would sit there and purr as he poked and prodded her like that. Edit: Your Brother is so gentle and affectionate. You are super lucky that he has those qualities.,80,aww
That's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.,20,aww
😊,36,aww
My heart is so happy for him, that’s so awesome!!! :),17,aww
This look reminds me of my late uncle who had severe CP, and when he held his brothers(my uncle) child for the first time. My uncle passed 5 months after my cousin was born. It’s a look someone cannot easily forget. This is the most goddamn heart felt thing reddit has ever provided. And DAMNIT we’re crying as a team.,14,aww
This is my life's work ideal of helping families *get here*. I am jelly and so happy. This is not about me but I needed it, thank you for the inspiration.,14,aww
Good on you OP, he looks so happy :),30,aww
Congrats on the little one OP!,27,aww
Right on.,12,aww
cute as hell,13,aww
Your daughter is going to have a really cool uncle.,9,aww
I have a fairly negative view of humans on r/aww........but damn it, rules are meant to be broken cause that gets me right in the feels. ❤️,122,aww
Holy shit there are some awful comments here.,26,aww
My brother also has Down syndrome. This is a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing :),11,aww
"I love this baby, I love everyone",10,aww
This should be on r/upliftingnews. Love seeing happy folks :),87,aww
Thank you for sharing this most awesome photo.  After a trying day this makes my heart smile.,7,aww
That's beautiful. I wish you well, into the future. I hope your baby can reciprocate, one day.,7,aww
That second picture is how I always felt cuddling with my babies. Now they're too old, but I recognized that look. So adorable.,7,aww
Beautiful. <3,8,aww
Ok, call me old news-- but how has "downsie" become a specified term of endearment for this demographic?,309,aww
Is ‘downsie’ a thing?,95,aww
That's Fuckin precious.,18,aww
Is “downsie” the affectionate term used for people with Down syndrome? Or are you just being a brother,18,aww
You're a good brother and father. I'm sorry for your brother's condition. I hope your whole family has many more beautiful moments like this.,204,aww
Omg the baby plucked his eyeball out *Kill Bill* style.,45,aww
r/MadeMeSmile,9,aww
He is gonna be an amazing uncle, never separate the two. That is an amazing show of pure love and connection.,9,aww
❤️ pure ❤️,11,aww
Pure love... thank you for sharing this,12,aww
The amount of love he has in that right photo is insanely beautiful and so innocent. That is truly beautiful.,11,aww
This hits home for me, as I have a younger sister with Down Syndrome and she loves babies. It's a complicated situation, as she also has Autism and she doesn't necessarily know when a baby has had enough - whenever she sees a baby she will immediately try and stroke it's hair. That can be a bit disconcerting when she runs to a pram being pushed by a parent who has no idea what's going on. You can't keep tabs on her all the time either. I am yet to have children but I know that in this situation, which will hopefully happen to me one day, it will be a strange mix of love and fear at the same time when I hand my child over to my little sister to hold.,23,aww
Honestly, God Bless you, your brother and your family,10,aww
So adorable, way to make it happen for him 😊,17,aww
When they a picture is worth a thousand words,  I'll know to show them this.  It's simple yet holds so much beauty and love.  It truly speaks for itself thank you so much for sharing OP - may your brother be loved on so much more this Christmas -  he has a big heart ❤️,5,aww
This is one of those beautiful moments in life we all need a little more of :). So heartwarming, it makes me happy,9,aww
I love this post! It’s so heart warming,10,aww
That indeed is incredibly cute. :),9,aww
Looks like he gives amazing hugs,8,aww
I am a recently new father and I am nearly in tears that you got to share this joy - the joy of holding a baby - with your brother. Happy holidays.,9,aww
Looks like a good guy. Got a good beard going too!,9,aww
And this folks, this right here is 100% true absolute love. Its beautiful.,11,aww
This is absolutely beautiful ❤️,4,aww
That's a true precious moment.,4,aww
This is beyond words beautiful.,3,aww
Why’d you gotta make my cry man :,),5,aww
That is such a beautiful moment you captured, thanks for sharing it 😢🙂,4,aww
My son has Down syndrome as well, he’s 4 now. He has cousins who are babies and he’s amazing with them, always kissing and hugging them lol. Great post op!,10,aww
I am very fortunate to have worked with Down syndrome students. These students were nothing but love. I could be having the  the shittiest day but I knew as soon as I walked into the classroom, I would be greeted by the most genuine smiles and hugs and it would brighten my day.,9,aww
Thank you for sharing with us ❤❤❤ your bro is a sweetheart,7,aww
Frame it,7,aww
His face is made of pure joy.  Bravo for you and the wife sharing this with him and making him so happy. I hope you have many more moments like this with him.,7,aww
[deleted],6,aww
I actively reject holding babies,28,aww
I want to appreciate how you used the term "downsie", because I've had a lot of struggle with this issue in the past.  My sister was born mentally retarded (Chromosomal Deletion and born without a Pulmonary Valve) and I've been crass with my language in the past, but the word "retarded" always struck an awful chord in me when I hear it in regular conversation.The truth is the more that vocabulary spreads, the less power it holds, and this has helped me to come to terms with the word.  From reading your post, I can empathize with where you're coming from, and I might be reading to far into this, but it really does make me happy to see the word "downsie" something so traditionally derogatory, turned against its meaning, towards one of empowerment.,18,aww
They both look so content. So sweet. My aunt has Williamson's and loves babies, we call her the baby whisperer. Give her a baby, baby goes to sleep.,3,aww
Great story, thanks for sharing!,3,aww
More please!,3,aww
That's beautiful.,3,aww
My Goodness. Love in its purest form. I will remember this beautiful picture for the rest of my life. Thank you for sharing it with us. Please give your brother a big hug for me.,7,aww
He's going to be a good uncle.,7,aww
This is such a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing it with us all :’),7,aww
That's pure love right there. There is hope......,6,aww
all the love i’m glad he has her. i’m glad she has him. i’m glad they both have you. blessings all around. <3,5,aww
I always thought downie was an insult...,58,aww
Such a great picture.,9,aww
That really perked me up. Been a rough day.Edit: Thanks for the smile :),9,aww
Downsie? My sis has downs too but I never heard this word.,33,aww
You've got one hell of a brother, OP. Cherish these moments, and let your children know that just because their uncle is a little different, he doesn't love them any less. Hell, it seems like he loves them more than the average person would for their own niece/nephew. Much love, from one person with special needs family to yours. Happy holidays,6,aww
Being an uncle is great. He's gonna love it.,7,aww
"Downsie" ? I've literally never heard that before, but it sounds wrong.,75,aww
I have a brother with Down syndrome . He loves babies too . Lucky he has a sister who has 4 so far lol . He’s an amazing helper too. I have many pictures of him holding all my kids .,9,aww
This is beautiful.For the last 2 years I have had a child with Down syndrome in my kindergarten/Grade1 class. I sobbed last week when it came time for them to move out of my room.It has now become my dream to work with people who have Down syndrome.,6,aww
He loves that baby. Compassion and love, the best human traits.,2,aww
Everyone deserves love,4,aww
The power of kindness and love!,4,aww
What a beautiful moment to have preserved like this! Everything from her obvious comfort in his arms, to his sense of peace when she settled against his shoulder. His joy radiates. Thank you so much for sharing this with the wider world.,6,aww
This is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing. You're a good brother, I am sure of it.,2,aww
That's just awesome man.,2,aww
Omg, they are so cute! Such a beautiful moment, thanks for sharing this with us. :),2,aww

My brother has down's syndrome and from what I see, has a monobrow similar to your brother's. Do you know if this a common thing among people with down's syndrome?,21,aww
Be still my heart. This is beyond precious.,5,aww
Oh man melted my heart ❤️,4,aww
Who the f is cutting onions here?,2,aww
Who's cutting onions...,51,aww
Very Very cool ! I have a sweet cousin  who is fairly high functioning, in fact, functioning far better than most allegedly normal people, unusually she is almost my age, 54! She's just great!,3,aww
Do you ever give him dolls?,3,aww
My sister has an undiagnosed syndrome that comes with an overall developmental delay and some coordination issues. But she adores babies and little kids. It breaks my heart seeing some of my family members getting so edgy around her with them and limiting her interaction when she is well aware of her limitations. I'm due in January and I cannot wait to let her cuddle her new nephew all the time.,3,aww
Wow. Our brothers are almost identical!,4,aww
So beautiful, god bless him.❤,18,aww
I can totally relate to your brother because I want to hold my cat like that but he won't let me :(,8,aww
I wish even half the humans on Earth could have that much love in their hearts. I have no connection to him, but by just staring at this picture, I can FEEL his love. Your bro is a total bro, bro.,11,aww
that is amazing and your brother is beautiful no matter his quirks,2,aww
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a long time. Your brother is an angel and is going to be a great uncle!,7,aww
Almost? I almost have to leave work early so no one sees me cry. That's awesome bud,6,aww
The way you love your brother and the way he loves your daughter is beautiful,3,aww
Why is it rare that someone lets him hold babies now? He looks so happy :) makes me happy,4,aww
How old are both of them?,3,aww
Look at the love in the picture on the right, so sweet!,3,aww
These remind me I am lucky beyond measure. Thank you for sharing.,2,aww

Love it!,1,aww
Beautiful!,2,aww
In a bad mood and was considering why live life but this, THIS made me smile.,-1,aww
Seriously why won’t people let him hold babies anymore? So long as they have developed neck muscles he seems more than capable of holding one well. My dad had two strokes and only has the use of one hand and he constantly holds my son. There are days where it’s like he’s a baby whisperer and my son will only calm for him.,-14,aww
Literally made me teary-eyed ♥️ Sweet love,0,aww
God is good😍. He is already being a loving uncle.  In return, your daughters perspective will be enhanced by just getting to know him. This made my night ❤️.,-180,aww
Too precious.,-15,aww
Please tell him I said his beard is epic. Edit: misspelled please,2,aww
This is absolutely beautiful. What a wonderful uncle to have growing up!,1,aww
This is the most adorable and perfect thing I've ever seen.I'm not crying, there's a stick in my eye.,1,aww
This is honestly beautiful. This probably made you cherish your brother to an entirely new level. Levels just keep going up. Thanks for sharing.,-1,aww

COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
This reminds me of my neighbors dog, he was on his death bed, the vet said he'd live another two weeks at the most. I brought my puppy over to meet him, and he instantly got up and ran toward her. He start to play with her like this. He lived another six months, he came to our back door daily to see my dog and i'd let her out to play with him all the time. It was almost like he was asking if my pup could come out to play... how could you say no to that?Edit: [I felt obligated here's them playing](https://imgur.com/a/Bc9N3),7700,aww
It's amazing how much hidden energy comes out of older dogs when they meet puppies.,3294,aww
I just love watching older dogs with puppies. When we got a puppy our senior dog was beside himself. He followed the puppy everywhere. He was half blind and he could barely keep track of the puppy but I'd never seen him so happy. He had always been a friendly, enthusiastic dog but the puppy gave him a second wind and maybe added a year or so to his life. That was nearly 12 years ago and now our puppy is an old dog. Their lives are just too fast.,12307,aww
I think the wrong gif loaded for me. I can only see 2 puppiesEdit; thanks /u/triconda for the gold :)) you made a depressing man's year end on a high.,2245,aww
This needs to go on longer,2513,aww
These are the same dogs from the gif where the puppy was a gift for the old dog. Anyone know if there is a full video?,552,aww
This video makes me SO happy. I brought my 9 month old Bernese home to my senior, family lab. Prior to him meeting my puppy, he was super depressed after my other family dog passed last year due to old age. He was constantly needing snuggles and attention, very little play drive (which also, admittedly, comes with age), and refusing to walk in the grass or stay outside. He was super lonely due to living alone with my mom after years of canine companionship. Now he’s rough housing, chewing on bones, and playing all day with my pupper. (:,594,aww
This is what my dogs experienced only in reverse in terms of size.  My 16.5 year old dog had the last 3 years of her life full of dealing with not one but two 25lbs that grew to eventually be100+lb big mastiff puppies bouncing around her poking and nudging her blind deaf bounce with each bark little 3lb body.   She was the boss and kept those two in line and they kept her younger. It was hilarious.,123,aww
"I'm not too sure about this little guy."(Pup does dog hop)(Old dog does dog hop)"OMG, best friends!",116,aww
That long old snout had smelled the human condition forever, then one beautiful day, the sweet smell of young puppy.,305,aww
Is it wrong that I read the title as “señor dog”??,636,aww
Aww, this is like watching grandparents play with their grandkids at the park, but floofier.,207,aww
I wonder if older dogs realize they were once puppies. Probably not, but a man can dream.,141,aww
I have a 13 year old dog and we got a puppy this summer. He’s exactly the same way with the puppy - I swear she’s the only reason he’s still with us.,68,aww
My whole life I've had golden retrievers and always would get a puppy when one of the dogs was 7 or 8 and life their lives. They showed this excitement every single time. The once puppy who met the old dog, then became the old dog and met the new young pup. I've always wondered if the old pup takes on the "parental" role and an instinct kicks in. Or if there's any science or study behind it. I've always observed them taking care of and following the pup,168,aww
Adding a puppy to the family with an older dog can actually inspire  the older dog to hold on a few extra years :),112,aww
my uncle had two dogs , both friendly but never like, crazy happy and jumpy. When one died , the other got depressed and would nope all day. We got her a 4 month old sibling and after a week I’ve never seen her so happy and acting just like the 4 month old. It was like she had a new lease on life.,50,aww

Dogs grow old but they're always puppies at heart :).,44,aww
Seriously thinking about getting a second dog. Only thing about my current dog I kind of dislike is that sometimes she wants to play and we have no energy. I've heard getting a second dog described as "getting an Xbox for your dog",16,aww
This is not always the case, my 2-1/2 year old golden can hardly stand my dad's 6 month old golden. First time I've ever seen him bare his teeth was only after hours of her chasing him around in circles trying to snarf his poor sopping wet face. He couldn't have been more thrilled to get home after Christmas!! He's still getting a younger sibling by the time he turns five. He needs someone to annoy the crap outta him, he's too damn lazy!!Edit: Having a 105 lb golden trying to hide from a 51 lb puppy who just wants to love and play is hilarious. Also, watching them almost figuring out tug of war was fun to watch.,16,aww
/r/ContagiousZoomies,42,aww
We had a pack of 3 for the longest time, and the 2 girls recently passed. Now we have a 14yr old, deaf Pitbull, and three 2yr old or younger other pups. It's crazy how our Pit went from being a grumpy old curmudgeon, to acting like this and playing with the pups. Probably helps we started giving him CBD (amazing!), but man it warms my heart to watch him play again.,43,aww
I have two dogs. Ones a 8 year old boxer and ones a 6 month old chihuahua mix. However before I got the chihuahua I had a rat terrier, Gracie, that lived to be 15 years old. Everyone in my family was sad to see that dog go including Buddha, my boxer. But after a few months we decided to get the chihuahua mix, Piper. And I'll tell you what I've seen a new energy in Buddha that I haven't seen since he was a puppy. Much more energetic and always playing with Piper. Growing up alongside another small dog he knows not to be too rough with her, but they sure do have a fun together! I love seeing how puppies can bring out the youth in an old dog.,14,aww
Once I finally own a home, I am going to adopt the oldest dog in the shelter.  I'll be raising my own pups but hopefully their youthful spirit will give the old guy/gal some happiness.  When they pass on, I will go back and get the oldest one again.  Hope to give these seniors a comfortable and inspiring place to retire.  Can't wait!,14,aww
give your dog a puppy. it is like a PS4 for your dog,22,aww
Arcanine meets Growlithe <3,63,aww
That’s actually a senior puppy meets a puppy and starts to feel like a regular puppy himself.  All dogs are puppies!!!,12,aww
So this is probably not safe for r/aww, butA friend had a 12 year old Newfie that was going through a tough time with Cancer treatments.  Being an old pup and sick he was fairly low energy.One day the Newfie meets my dog , a Shepard/ Chow mix, and you can see the excitement light him up he runs up to greet my dog and then proceeds to try climb up and mount my dog. My dog, a male is confused and not having any of it.I was also horrified seeing 250 pounds of dog move so fast.The Newfie's owner says he normally doesn't do stuff like that, but ocassionally thing for webed paws, which my dog did have. Learn something new every day.,11,aww
Old dogs and puppies are an adorable combo. We had a female dog of 12 years and introduced a puppy. The old dog was female and the puppy was male. The puppy began pissing like a female dog, having learned it from the old dog. It took a long time after the death of the older dog (who I think died of exhaustion from the puppy) to learn to pee like a male dog.,8,aww
r/mademesmile,7,aww
My god, golden pups are my weakness. Idk what it is about them that gets me all warm and fuzzy inside. I think it’s the eyes? Wait no, maybe the cloudboye cuteness? Idk. Little fuckers.,8,aww
Is it possible that when an older dog gets excited when seeing a puppy is actually them perceiving they are a puppy as well?,8,aww
This may sound dumb but the same happens to me when I spend time with my babysitter/nanny and her friends.  I train them at the gym and after awhile, I find myself feeling as young as they are and gossiping and having the same emotions as them.  Maybe I’m reliving my younger 20s days with them or maybe I just enjoy girls that remind me when I was carefree and childless.,12,aww

I had a 10 year old standard poodle named Max who was having seizures almost every week and we were getting extremely worried and began discussing euthanasia with the vet. Shortly thereafter, my friend's golden doodle had a litter of 9 pups and we brought one home and they became best buds. Max never had another seizure for the rest of his life and he lived to 16.

we got a puppy after one of our dogs died suddenly. our other dog was 11 at the time and really showing it. that puppy easily added a good few years to her life. she’s been gone for a while now and the puppy is getting old fast. going to go hug her extra tight now :),3,aww
Every time my dog does something bad I come on Reddit and see something about a senior dog and feel guilty and go play with my pup for an hour or six.,3,aww

When my parents got the dog of our neighbor that passed away, we kept it for a year but because the dog was starting to have trouble with everything so we decided to put the sweet dog down. In the vets office there was a puppy and the dog that could barely see or even stand up anymore started jumping and running around with the puppyIt was a sweet kinda smelly doggy,3,aww

When my dog Sadie died (coming up on 2yr mark) our older dog, who had known her for 6 years, was depressed. Wouldn't leave his bed. We got a 1yr old, super energetic/happy dog. The old man is still crotchety,  but he's been happier with the little one than he ever has been.,2,aww

we had our dog Rocky for 14 years. at about 8-9 years old he was in really bad health though. we got a puppy to give him some company and he was like reborn. he finally needed to be put down at 14 but it was much longer than we ever anticipated him making it.,2,aww
Nice video....goldens are always live like puppies...,2,aww
When my dog was 9 we got a puppy too, she did the same thing. Suddenly she was many years younger again! Even when we went out, she would start dancing around other dogs if she liked them. It was beautiful to see but alas she passed last year at 16,5 years old. We now have 2 puppies of 3 months, and the 8 year old doesn't have that puppy loving character but once in a while she'll start dancing and the pups get confused.,2,aww
My family's first dog, Haley, was just 2 when my parents got her from the RSPCA. She had a gammy leg as her previous owners chucked her out of a moving car on the motorway (freeway) and broke her leg, but she was always super active in high spirits. She was a labrador/border collie cross and so her life expectancy wasn't amazing, but when I was 7, we got another labrador puppy from my Uncle and named him Billy. Despite Haley getting on in her age at that point, she was always super active due to Billy's influence and his youth, and she always played and ran around the park with him when we took them on walks. She passed away when she was 15, and then Billy recently passed away at the age of 14 earlier this year in February. Sad times but good memories and I'm glad they got to live as long as they did.,2,aww
This is great, is there a sub for this kind of thing?,2,aww

What a sweet old man! It's amazing how a younger dog can just bring out the puppy in another dog. It really warms my heart.,4,aww
It's crazy how older dogs will come alive when they see a small pho. For better or worse. My old girl blew both her rear knees out chasing my fiances pug around the backyard. Couldn't afford surgery and my mom almost put her down. She couldn't really walk for several weeks, had to put a towel under her belly and lift her back legs up to take her outside. I convinced her to give her a chance to heal and sure enough she is walking and doing fine, even has to take stairs daily to go outside now.,3,aww

I once had a beautiful puppy cuter than a japanese baby hamster farm. I named him "Chimmy" because my very young nephew's first word was "chimney" except he said it like    "chimmy". Anyway, I remember it was around the first week that I got him that I decided I would take him to the park and let him roam around a bit. He frollicked like a good boy and women and children all startwd taking pictures so i did find out how much of a babe magnet puppies can be. So one of the girls has her own dog with her, an older labrador, and she asks if chimmy wants to play with "Corporal". I of course say yes amd they begin playing. But then i get a weird feeling in my stomach so i take out a pen thats in my pocket and stab myself in the eye. Blood is gushing everywhere and getting all over the puppies fur. Everyone is screaming but i just laugh and tell them my name is Peter Mondragon. What a fun day.,1,aww
My 12 year old chap did this the other day. We was absolutely knackered after meeting the puppy and plodded home after that,1,aww

Very cute! Puppies definitely bring out the playfulness in older dogs! My family had an older Dachshund (around 10-11) and we got a puppy dachshund. The older dog Roxy and the puppy would chase each other around the living playing.,1,aww

I love seeing this. I have a yellow lab named Molly that I grew up with who is still loving life over at my parents house. They thought she wasn’t going to be around much longer; though I disagreed with that, they got a puppy chocolate lab and I had never seen Molly so ecstatic and happy it was like a second wind. Definitely added some years to her life I would say:),1,aww
I have a 13 year old dachshund. He normally moves around slowly and gingerly and sleeps a lot. But when he comes across another dachshund, he momentarily turns back into a puppy. It is so sweet.,1,aww

My girl and the pit my next door neighbors have are just the same way!! She’s a rescue that’s been scared of dogs since I got her and he’s definitely starting to show his age, but get them outside together and they’re running and jumping around like they’re both about 5 months old.It’s one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen.,1,aww
Animals never seem to grow up. Just takes more effort for them to do what they've always done. I've got a lab probably in the dog equivalent of his fifties / sixties and he always acts extra playful around puppies at the park,1,aww

That's some wholesome shizz right there.,3240,aww
Right in the feels...,1094,aww
Just realised that deaf is the perfect way to be if you work in a school.,1525,aww
This is really beautiful. It’s great to see custodians being acknowledged and celebrated. In my experience custodians at schools get treated so much better than in other place but I’m sure that’s not true everywhere. My dad worked as a custodian when I was growing up for a subsidized elderly apartment building. Despite him being incredibly nice to the residents (all residents had his personal phone number and could call him at any time day or night for their clogged toilet or leaky pipe, hell he went out there are 2am because a resident said their door closed “too loudly”.) yet they treated him like garbage. One summer I worked as a custodian for a large manufacturing plant. Everyone I saw would tell me I needed to do a better job cleaning their cubicle, or I missed a spot over in x, even though it was just two of us cleaning a gigantic building and had cycles of what we cleaned on what days based on what the person in charge at the company wanted. Despite explaining this to them, they would continue to point out “mistakes” everyday. Please appreciate what custodians do and give them respect. The jobs has its moments, but is never a great time. Feeling respected and appreciated goes a long way.,387,aww
I wish the camera had been better positioned but this is awesome!  I am deaf and think this is wonderful.,137,aww
No sound on the video, couldn't hear them.,1216,aww
Oh man, I had an awesome custodian when I was in elementary school!! This just reminded me!His name was Michael (don't remember his last name), and he was somewhat old. He always used to yell "If you recycle, you can call me Michael!" He was like the only guy that reminded us to use the recycling bins. And if he ever caught you cleaning something up, he'd give you some jolly ranchers.Didn't realize how cool of a dude he was until just now.,88,aww
I did the exact same thing he did when I saw the kids signing. This is just so cute!!!,174,aww
This was his 60th birthday and he has been working in the school system for more than 20 years.  You don't need sound to understand the love on display here.,157,aww
I'm not crying .. that's pee. Eye pee. I have a disease. Not important,1425,aww

There is still hope for this world,91,aww
We had an awesome Custodian through my whole elementary school time.I think one of the reasons kids always have this connection to custodians is that they're one of the only adults in the school who aren't trying to boss you around or who have authority over you, so they kinda become friends, like you're in it together.,23,aww
Amazing.,13,aww

These videos always make me think about times i’ve missed out on doing something good like this just because i didn’t think of it,11,aww
As a fire alarm service tech I talk to a lot of school custodian and facility staff let me tell you, these men and women are usually some of society’s nicest, down to earth people you can meet. I swear I never get a warmer greeting from anyone else then I do from these people.,11,aww
One of the Custodians at my wife's elementary school is deaf and reads lips very well. He LOVES when our toddler is with her at school because we taught him very basic sign language from infancy. They really do have a bond that we can't understand.,11,aww

I guess that after reading many comments on this post, my comment would be...How about be nice to everyone. Treat people the way you want to be treated.We never know what is going on in another human beings’ mind. We don’t know what kind of trouble they are in or what terrible news they received or whatever it is that makes them act in an “unfriendly “ way.A smile and a word of encouragement will go a loooooooong way.I have to challenge all of you here who has someone in you workplace who’s a sour puss or jus an unfriendly person. Try to change it by changing your attitude and approach. It may take a while but when you really try and put the effort in, you’ll be amazed what you can do with just being kind and approach someone without prejudice and no preconditions.Treat others the way you want to be treated and you’ll see what a wonderful world you make this world become.Peace ✌️,6,aww
My elementary school janitor's name was Mr Manuel, and he was a friggin awesome dude. Each monthly assembly he would present the cleanest Graderoom with the Golden Garbage Can award... legit just a garbage can spray painted gold lmao. But I'll never forget him.,7,aww
I LOST it watching this last night. I’m a teacher and in undergrad several of my professors made sure to emphasize how important it is to have a good relationship with the school secretary and the building custodian. I make sure at the end of my Friday’s to go shoot the shit with the custodian in the boiler room. My mom is a school secretary so I already knew to be nice to those.,5,aww
This hits home. My mom is a custodian at a school and from what ive seen, they love her there. And she deserves every bit of it. She stays past what she is paid and goes above and beyond every day. She deserves the same love when she gets home. But that doesnt always happen. Shes always so happy when she brings back pictures of her favorite kids and teachers or when they give her things.Firmly believe its gestures like this that make the job worth it.,8,aww
If this doesn’t warm your heart, then you are a cold bastard.,5,aww
This made me realize that sign language should be taught in school. Not necessarily a ton  of it, but definitely enough that everyone can communicate the necessities regardless of whether they can hear or not.,5,aww
Back in school we all respected our custodians, to the point where the one time some students tried to bully and mess with them the whole school went on alert to stop it.,3,aww
I'm curled up in a ball. Puking my guts out. Moving hurts like a goddamn volcano up my ass. But this..this is good,4,aww

Holy crap, this is the cutest god damn thing ever.,4,aww
"This looks cute! \*puts on headphones to hear it\*"I'm an idiot.,4,aww
Poor guys knee looks jacked up,3,aww
Hes gonna remember that for the rest of his life,4,aww
I think this is wonderful! People don’t realize how important our school custodial staff does everyday. They are the ones that keep the schools running! Way to go kids! He really deserves it! 😊,3,aww
What is this wetness around my eyes? The fuck?,3,aww
This just totally made my day!,4,aww
wow!,5,aww
Oh... well I'm gonna cry.,3,aww
Wholesome af,11,aww
Why people aren’t kind to custodians is just beyond me.  This is how I judge how people truly are.,3,aww
Videos like this make my heart melt.,3,aww
The old man rub face beard thing gets me right in the feels every time.,3,aww
This custodian appreciation thing is wonderful, please keep it up.,3,aww
I tried to turn my volume up to listen to this. Didn't really think that through...,3,aww
Sound doesn’t work on video /s.,3,aww
Tried to increase volume then remembered the title, feeling like an asshole now.,3,aww
SERIOUS: Is it still calling singing in sign language?,3,aww
NO, You are crying!,3,aww
I read half the title and started watching and was like, "I wonder if I could turn on the sound for this, it looks adorable."Then I read the other half,3,aww
Still wish the video had audio..,3,aww
Who put this bowl of onions here 😭😭That gave me all the feels!,3,aww
now this is cool! more of this, less of the crap in the news!,3,aww
Did I just try and turn up the volume on a sign language video?,3,aww
I can’t hear it..,3,aww
There's no sound!,3,aww
this is wonderful...love still seeing signs of decent humanity. :),3,aww
Ok, but who was singing the loudest?,3,aww
Wish this video had sound.... ohhhh.,3,aww
What a wonderful gesture! Kudos to the teachers for teaching them how to sign and to acknowledge him in that way!  For all those asking for sound....  He’s deaf!  Try listening with your heart and your eyes..... from his perspective. To him there wasn’t any sound.,12,aww
I tried to turn the volume up but I forgot they were signing fml,2,aww
This shit made my eyes fog up.,2,aww
At first I was disappointed there was no sound. Then I realized this is the most authentic experience.,2,aww
Why is there no sound?,2,aww
This just totally made my day!,2,aww
The teacher is the real mvp here.,2,aww
Then the janitor laid down some pipes on the teacher for good measure,2,aww
Thanks I’m sobbing at work now,2,aww
Custodians were always the nicest people. As long as I was nice to them, they’d help me out more than most teachers would,2,aww
First post I look at today, aaaaand I'm crying.,2,aww
Needs a repost on r/humansbeingbros,2,aww
This is the sweetest thing ever,2,aww
Props to the teacher to taking class time to do this. Teaching kids another language is difficult, and she used it to teach them another lesson on appreciating those around us. Bravo!,2,aww
Why the fuck don't we pay teachers more?!?!!!?!?!!!!,2,aww
I like this new trend of custodian appreciation,2,aww
Lovely 😊 I love seeing schools appreciating their custodians.,2,aww
Can we make this whole making custodians feel amazing a daily thing?,2,aww
I'm not teasing the guy but I walk like that after sitting on the toilet too long on reddit.,2,aww
This reminded me that I still have a heart.,2,aww
Sign language is truly amazing <3,2,aww
Ok, how many of you instantly tried to turn the volume up?! I need to know I'm not alone!,2,aww
I love that one kid who was just circling his arms in front of him the whole time.,2,aww
Is there a version with sound?,2,aww
This video needs sound,2,aww
Was gonna ask for video with audio then I realized....,2,aww
I tried to put the sound on.... to hear the singing..... ... .,2,aww
Does he have a messed up knee/leg/back, or is he just doing a dramatic falling walk like you might do when you’re taken back by the magic of the situation?,2,aww
Love this! I work for the school board and there’s no one besides the principal I respect more than the custodial staff... if I see kids purposely making a mess, I make them clean it up and give them a lecture on how hard the custodians work for them and me. It’s a thankless job and no one knows how much work or hours they actually do.,2,aww
am i the only dumbass that turned up my volume expecting to hear something,2,aww
That really made my day, and it's only 9am,2,aww
I want a sub specifically for people being wholesome to custodians,2,aww
Custodians don’t get enough love. Good job kids, faith in humanity restored.,2,aww
Once when I was complaining about mowing lawns my mom told me, “There’s no job which you’re too good to do.” At first, I took it as a slight. But now that I’m older, I really appreciate her saying it and I try my best to remember it.,2,aww
Made my day thank you, there is still good in the world. Just a little bit sometimes is huge.,2,aww
r/MadeMeSmile,2,aww
This is awesome. I supervise construction. I had one def carpenter working on my site out of 200 + workers. He communicated with everyone only through text and note pads. I took the time to learn and teach my team to say good morning and good night when we saw him. He was so excited the first morning I used it he started signing me and I had to explain I don’t know sign I just learned for him. We are still friends.,2,aww
I wish I could upvote this a million times!,2,aww
School custodians are just the best people somehow.  They deserve so much more than we give them for the work they do and the things they put up with - and always with a smile.,2,aww
Can we get a link with sound ffs...,2,aww
I'm dumb. Checking my volume cause I didn't hear anything,2,aww
I'm not crying, you're crying.,2,aww
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😢,2,aww
Too early for chopping onions in here.  /sniff,2,aww
\-My hands so hurt...\-Why?\-I've been singing all night!,2,aww
I love how much fun the teacher looks like she’s having while she’s signing with them! I love how much fun everyone looks like they’re having! My morning started out so shitty, I’m so glad this vid was the first thing I saw when I opened reddit.,2,aww
I’m really dumb I turned this up expecting there to be volume,2,aww
My heart.,2,aww
Yes, yes, this is great. But: Is this a StarWars shirt?,2,aww
This is so great. That teacher is thoughtful. The kids learned more than just sign language.,2,aww
I'm not crying, you're crying.,2,aww
Learning the best lessons early!,2,aww
❤️❤️❤️❤️,2,aww
These kids touched this guys heart for life!,2,aww
I have something in my eye. I'm not tearing up!,2,aww
Why did I turn my volume up,2,aww
My son is taking ASL as his foreign language in high school. I hope so much that he has the opportunity to make someone happy with his knowledge.  Loved seeing this today😁,2,aww
wow,2,aww
This!! And more of this kind of stuff, throughout the world. I need it, so I don’t loose hope in mankind. Thanks OP :),2,aww
It’s nice to be important. But it’s more important to be NICE.,2,aww
r/mademesmile,2,aww
This was lovely,2,aww
Isn't this same custodian we saw in the gym last week?,2,aww
Is Teacher wearing \_leggings\_?,2,aww
Videos of people crying for joy will never get old. I love these.,2,aww
That’s amazing he must be really proud them after that.,2,aww
I’m crying,2,aww
Oh...my heart. Why does it feel stretched to breaking and then full to overflowing at the same time? I love this feeling.  What a sweet thing to do. ❤️,2,aww
Always remember to be nice to custodians! When I was a sophomore dorming in college we had a "floor meeting" and I suggested, hey, we should give the janitor a thank you card for all he's done for us. Well, the RA looked at me like "uh, okay..." and honestly the weird reaction from her and her assistant made me back off. I feel bad I never thanked him, but I got so self-conscious about my suggestion. I thought, maybe that isn't really a thing these people do. I mean, I grew up with my mom tipping the mailperson at Christmas, so I figured being appreciative was normal.,2,aww
Who’s chopping onions??,2,aww
I wondered why there was no sound at first but then i realised it,2,aww
More wholesome than wholesome!,2,aww
I thought it said "sids king" at first,2,aww
I’m not crying...It’s just been rainin’, on my face.,2,aww
Well done kids! It is very well thought out!,2,aww
This the kinda shit that makes you cry on your period,2,aww
One of my happiest memories from elementary school was giving my janitor a box of Oreos for winter break. You could tell he was so happy 😁.,2,aww
Does he have a feather duster?  There appears to be a lot ...sniff ... of dust ... sniff ... in here. *reaches for tissue*,2,aww
I remember if fourth grade we had a janitor named Martin. He was a hispanic man who couldn’t really speak english all that well. Anyways every time we would have an assembly in the gym Martin would always be on the stage doing a final sweep of the floor. Me and my friends just started chanting Martin, Martin, Martin and eventually most of the gym joined in and this continued every time he would appear on stage and you could see his eyes light up and he couldn’t contain his smile anymore. Martin if your reading, your the fucking man.,2,aww
Eyebleach,2,aww
Where's the sound?,2,aww
Jannitor in a video : instant upvote,2,aww
My. Freaking. Heart.,2,aww
Who brought onions?,2,aww
This made me cry. Such genuine happiness. Don’t feel like I see these kinds of things enough these days.,2,aww
I’m stone cold and eyes did not water at all.,2,aww
If I ever have kids I hope to God that they have teachers like these two. I don't have clear memories of math or science or reading lessons from elementary school, but I can clearly recall the lessons I was taught about being kind to others.,2,aww
The sweetest thing ever,2,aww
I FREAKING LOVE VIDEOS ABOUT APPRECIATING JANITORS 😭😂💕,2,aww
Ok, this is fucking adorable! :'),2,aww
Well that's wholesome.,2,aww
this was a great way to start my day. thank you,2,aww
my stupid ass was trying to find the volume control to turn it up,2,aww
I'm not crying your crying!,2,aww
I'm not crying, it's just been raining, on my face.,2,aww
Aww,2,aww
Make me cry at work...,2,aww
Yay!! So wonderful!! So mamy ways!!!,2,aww
This reminds me of my elementary school janitor, a Vietnam veteran. The whole whole school lined up and cheered on his last day of work there.,2,aww
Instant tears. To see children learning sign language is something, but see them put it to such compassionate use is tear jerking,2,aww
Expected to 'hear' the kids singing for a moment, and then realized, wait it's exactly what the custodian would have experienced.,2,aww
We need more of these kinds of thing in the news!! That guy looks legit thrilled about this!,2,aww
I wanna fuckin cry fam...,2,aww
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING,2,aww
I'm not fucking crying, YOURE CRYINGGG,2,aww
Yo that’s wholesome as fuck,2,aww
No shit here, it made my eyes wet.How sweet.,2,aww
It warms my heart to see the expression in the man's face.&#x200B;,2,aww
My dad is a custodian too and he loves his job, it's great seeing this. 🥰,2,aww
These never fail to make me happy. What wonderful teachers these ladies are!,2,aww
His reaction!! Genuine surprise and appreciation! I love these videos,2,aww
We don’t deserve custodians 😭😭😭😭,2,aww
❤️❤️❤️ beautiful,2,aww
This actually made me start crying. This is one of the best things I've EVER seen on this subreddit.,2,aww
[deleted],2,aww
I cant hear anything bro,2,aww
Reddit needed this today.,2,aww
MY HEARTmy emotions,2,aww
Why cant the news show this as much as they show the hate and anger they want you to see?The fact that this made me tear up is sad. This should make me so happy, it did, but I wish I could feel that more often. I'm tired of being angry.,2,aww
Those are some awesome teachers.,2,aww
Unpopular opinion here, but isn't it sort of demeaning to be OVERLY nice to a custodian? It almost feels as if you are pitying them. Don't get me wrong, you should always be kind and considerate to anyone regardless of their position but all of this over the top custodian worship strikes me as sort of bizarre.,2,aww
Me: I’ll just have a quick peek at reddit during my downtime at work Boss: what’s wrong?? Why are you crying!,2,aww
Can we get it with sound?,2,aww
Really?!? Isn't it a little early to choke me up with somerhing like this?,2,aww
As the son of a retired Janitor, that would've made his year.,2,aww
The sound isn't working. :/,2,aww
I feel that two things are inevitable in elementary school: Someone smears shit on the bathroom wall and everyone loves the custodian.,2,aww
IF YOU DONT THANK YOUR ~~BUS DRIVER~~ CUSTODIAN YOURE A RACIST,2,aww
**Awwwww, how nice. That's sweet.**,2,aww
Why do people never post the video with sound,2,aww
Is there sound for this?,2,aww
Why is there no sound?,2,aww
Imma cry famz,2,aww
Stop making my allergies make my eyes water up, you bastards.,2,aww
nah im not crying, one of the kids must be cutting onions or something.,2,aww
I read the title, then immediately paused the video to try and turn the sound on.Ill be ok...,2,aww
My father is a lead custodian and has the kindest heart of anyone I know! He works at an elementary school and takes his job seriously for the well-being of the students and staff. He never judges a soul, but he also never allows bullying or disrespect of any kind. He loves interacting with the kiddos, and each year he looks forward to surprising his co-workers with Christmas gifts. He expects nothing in return for his kindness. He does his work thoroughly, enjoys getting top-scores on all of his inspections, and spends plenty of time outside of work with my special needs brother and disabled mother. I adored having my father with me during my elementary school years. I saw him as a protector, and he was always super nice to my friends and classmates too.  I still adore him now that he's ready for retirement. I don't think he will ever lose his dedication and determination to his work!,2,aww
Can someone find me the one with sound,2,aww
Videos of people shedding tears of joy or being genuinely touched by the kindness of others is my favorite thing in the internet.,2,aww
We had a custodian at my elementary school that was an amazing guy. He was nice as hell and all the kids loved him. One day our teacher was being a butch so he made a bs excuse to get us out early and gave us chocolate milk and cookies and sat and talked with us about it. He died in a car accident a few weeks later and literally the whole school cried. Rip Mr. Ray,2,aww
Why doesn't the gif have sound I can't understand what they're saying,2,aww
I’m not crying, you’re crying! ❤️😂❤️😂,2,aww
Singing HBD to custodians is a much better trend to see go viral than trying to dance outside your moving car or waiting in a corn field dressed as a clown to scare people.,2,aww
This makes me smile. When I was in elementary school, like k-4th I would leave treats for the custodian who cleaned our classrooms, especially around holidays. Custodians are underappreciated, especially the ones that work in schools!,2,aww
It’d be better with audio...Yes I know I’m going to hell.However this strange liquid started to come out of my eyes around the second loop.,2,aww
Fuck i feel awful. First thing i asked was “wheres the sound” until i properly read the title again,2,aww
Cuts onions in sign language,2,aww
its existed for 8 hours and already has top gliding on r/aww, wow.also very fitting that the GIF is silent.,2,aww
I'm not crying! You're crying!,2,aww
Turned the volume all the way up then realized the grave mistake I made Oops!,2,aww
Where's the sound?,2,aww
It always makes me so happy to see schools doing nice things for janitors, and then seeing the janitor happy,2,aww
Treating people like human beings, always the best way! Best teacher! 👐👐👐,2,aww
I can't hear anything!  Can you please re-upload with sound!,13,aww
I can’t get the audio to work,9,aww
I love that even singing it in sign language Happy Birthday is hard for everyone to get in sync.  Universal experiences no matter what your background or language make humankind a beautiful thing.,2,aww
No volume?,7,aww
OMG ! So Amazing the kids were looking happy !,2,aww
That guy has a hell of a limp.,2,aww
Who left this bowl of onions here?,1,aww
This is amazing, great to see first thing in the morning :),1,aww
A sister making a brother happy, I can dig that,1,aww
This is so beautiful,1,aww
That's awesome. And I hope they continue to treat their custodian with the same kindness as they grow up.,1,aww
Hit me right in the feels first thing in the morning!,1,aww
Oh man I’m sobbing now this is so sweet,1,aww
tears in my eyes love it.,1,aww
My heart,1,aww
Giving me all the feels this morning,1,aww
Too sweet!,1,aww
Fucj I almost cried,1,aww
His reaction makes me so happy,1,aww
One of the kids accidentaly put the school on fire due to flame justsu,1,aww
Why no sound?,1,aww
This is a pure and beautiful thing.,1,aww
I always thought it was just my schools where the custodians were awesome people that deserved this kind of stuff. I love seeing shit like this.,1,aww
It’s fitting there’s no sound.,1,aww
This is beautiful :),1,aww
This is one of the nicest things I have seen all this week.,1,aww
This is a pure and beautiful thing.,1,aww
It’s too early in the morning to be tearing up at my desk.,1,aww
why are my eyes sweating,1,aww
This is beautiful,1,aww
I laughed because the video has no sound.,1,aww
Jesus, just be nice to people who deal with you, what you consume or what you throw away. How hard is that?,1,aww
That head grab says it all,1,aww
This is that kind of good shit I needed on a crappy morning.,1,aww
Is that really considered singing, or just aggressive signing.,1,aww
this video is so sad :(,1,aww
Here, have my awwpvote,1,aww
How are they gonna top this one? Are kids going to do some sky writing for their janitor next time?,1,aww
I have a cold. I just woke up. I WASN'T READY 😭😭😭😭,1,aww
No sound? /s,1,aww
These kids half assed it.... Still wholesome af,1,aww
How does this not have more upvotes?!,1,aww
This is so precious,1,aww
This is the sweetest thing ever!,1,aww
This was the best post to wake up to this morning,1,aww
Someone get these damn onions out of here!!!,1,aww
Probably thought he was coming in to the class to clean up sick or wee and then gets a surprise like that,1,aww
Why did I expect sound wth,1,aww
This is so heart warming <3,1,aww
children will always bring a smile to our faces no matter the situation. I love what am seeing.,1,aww
A little bit hope for humanity has been restored,1,aww
Custodians dont ever get the credit they deserve. This is very heart warming.,1,aww
We had a housekeeper in my dorm in college. Lois was a sweet elderly lady, and my suitemate and I would tap dance for her. She loved it, loved us, and we loved her. One of my happiest memories of college.,1,aww
The feels are strong with this one.,1,aww
Wow!,1,aww
I was like „this is probably way better with sound“...,1,aww
This man looks like one of the sweetest custodians, he deserves this.,1,aww
Did anyone else try to see if there was sound and then feel like an idiot?,1,aww
As a custodian, I love this! It’s a thankless job but a moment like this makes all the crap (literal and figurative) worth it,1,aww
r/wholesome,1,aww
Where's the sound to this gif? Oh wait ...,1,aww
I never thought I'd see anything from where I live on here! That's hickerson elementary in Coffee County.,1,aww
Yes!! More janitor appreciation posts!!,1,aww
Some of the singing is a little pitchy. But coming from kids, that makes it even cuter. Aaaawwwww....,1,aww
This is the new grandpa’s and dad’s crying over gifts trend. Totally fine with both trends coexisting in harmony.,1,aww
This the shit i live for,1,aww
Why can't I hear the sound,1,aww
When did the kids learn sign language,1,aww
Tears-of-joy jutsu,1,aww
His reaction is absolutely priceless!,1,aww
Me and one of the custodians at my school are both metalheads, so he always asks me what I’m listening to. And since I usually sit alone at lunch he frequently talks to me about music/movies/video games and he seems like a really cool dude.,1,aww
I was expecting sound, but it makes more sense this way.,1,aww
I can't hear what they're singing,1,aww
All the feels,1,aww
I often think I wish I could see the custodian from the small school I went to from 1st to 5th grades.  His name was Mitch and he was the nicest old black man you could EVER meet.  He gave the best hugs and I wish I could have another 35 years later.  There was only one class per grade and he knew us all.,1,aww
Very heartwarming,1,aww
In middle school I had this janitor named Mr. Stapleton. He was kind of big and gruff but also really nice. I'd always say hi to him coming into school and he'd always call me "little man." Don't know why but it always made my day a little bit.,1,aww
This is the smile I TOTALLY NEEDED this morning.  I'm actually tearing up, watching his reaction.  Thanks for posting.,1,aww
Every viral tweet i see on twitter ends up on reddit after  few hours.,1,aww
Our high school janitor got some gifts from our school and a deafening, earth-shattering cheer/applause on her last day before she retired. Felt like one of those "where were you?" moments around our school.Margaret you're awesome.,1,aww
Great. Now my boss wants to have a private meeting about why I'm crying at work.,1,aww
A very caring act of humanity,1,aww
I was set up selling antiques at an outdoor show at Jack London Square in Oakland in the 90s.Behind my set-up was this little mini-bandstand... with enough room for maybe three guys or a barbershop quartet,  a permanent fixture (at the time anyway)I hear something going on behind me, I turn and see that there are about a dozen little kids on the bandstand, their parents sitting in folding chairs, and some music comes on.&#x200B;It's R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly." The kids stand there swaying and signing to it, the parents faces are beaming... I watch for a moment, and the realize I have to quickly duck into the men's room around the corner so nobody will see me burst into tears.&#x200B;Little kids, man. Little deaf kids getting support and love from proud happy parents... my own childhood was the total opposite, could not possibly be more opposite, maybe that has something to do with my reaction, but man... &#x200B;I STILL get choked up when I hear that song because of that day... that stupid, cloying, horrible cheesy song... I see those parents and kids.,1,aww
1. Try not to cry2. cry an awful lot,1,aww
They did an awful job,1,aww
Made my fucking day.,1,aww
And I was annoyed because I couldn't fine the volume/sound button...,1,aww
My volume isn’t working,1,aww
Can we get one with sound?,1,aww
Oh my god that’s so beautiful!,1,aww
I was wondering why there was no sound, but...,1,aww
I love happy people,1,aww
we heard it was your birthday,1,aww
At my middle school the head custodian was a treasure. He remembered all of our names and was super sweet. And in high school we had lunch lady appreciation day. Everyone deserves recognition!,1,aww
Now this makes me hopeful,1,aww
That's actually amazing,1,aww
Too bad it’s a gif so I couldn’t hear the singing,1,aww
This made my day :),1,aww
Where is the sound?,1,aww
/r/WatchPeopleLiveInside ?,1,aww
Such a small, thoughtful act of kindness that will have such a positive impact on that janitor and the kids.,1,aww
Kids are wonderful makes you smile and cry at the same time Beautiful,1,aww
heartwarming,1,aww
Wow, no audio?,1,aww
More please,1,aww
That’s beautiful! These Kids are great... Glad they made his birthday a happily memorable one,1,aww
My heart,1,aww

Oh yea this totally made my day. Just what I needed,1,aww
One of the nicest videos I've seen in quite some time. Thank you for sharing.,1,aww
Willy doesn’t hear ya. Willy still cares.,1,aww
I love this!  I remember the custodian at my elementary school, Mr Jimmy.  Us kids treated him like a rock star and he may as well have been.  He was the nicest, funniest people I've met.  He loved all of us kids and went above and beyond every day. Thanks, Mr Jimmy.,1,aww
Reddit you gotta stop making me cry this nearly dog,1,aww
Great on so many levels.,1,aww
Reddit you gotta stop making me cry this early dog,1,aww
not sure why i felt the need to turn the volume up,1,aww
There is goodness in this world.,1,aww
WHY ARE MY EYES LEAKING,1,aww
When he puts his hands on his head, such pure happiness,1,aww
The people who have overcome the greatest hurdles take the most joy out of life,1,aww
Turn the Volume up ay,1,aww
I needed this 🙏🏾🙏🏾,1,aww
my heart ♥️,1,aww
Aww,1,aww
I guess it's fitting that this video doesn't have sound. Makes for a really immersive experience.,1,aww
It's interesting to see just the change in posture.  He obviously has issues with his leg, and his posture probably suffers from it....but the moment he sees those kids, he stands up straight, smiling.  It's like he was 20 years younger for a moment.  Truly a special moment.,1,aww
What an awesome thing to do, takes like 2 mins yet it will become a lifelong memory. That’s dope.,1,aww
This is the beauty of what small gestures mean to someone. Hats off to the teacher and students for doing this!,1,aww
My elementary school’s custodian worked there for 20 years at the least. He was so cool. Wore leather jacket, rode his motorcycle every day, had a mullet, mustache, and still looked classy. He also gave great advice and always took time to console a crying or hurt kid. I went back there when my half brother started school and he was still there 20 years later! Gave him a hug and thanked him for the all the love he put into his work and care for the kids.,1,aww
Something to the effect of "your worth is not judged you by the way you treat the people that you serve, it's judged by the way that you treat the people who serve you",1,aww
One of the most important rules for a teacher to follow is to be nice to the custodial/janitorial staff. Invite them to your holiday parties. Hook them up with snacks. Treat them with respect. If you do, they will take good care of you. If you don’t, don’t expect them to go that extra mile for you.,1,aww
Um it’s not even 10am and I’m already crying,1,aww
Didn’t have to play the video. Already getting feels.,1,aww
Awesome!,1,aww
Shit, I should probably know the Birthday of my cleaning people.,1,aww
My elementary school janitor at Rohr Elementary School 1970's was Mr Dempsey. He was a nice Grandpa type, WWII vet and I would bring him treats when my mom baked. Thank you Mr Dempsey!,1,aww
this is wonderful...love still seeing signs of decent humanity. :),1,aww
Being loved and appreciated by children might be the most pure unfiltered love there is.,1,aww
Love how some of the kids are like me trying to do YMCA:IT'S GOOD TO BE A THE [something, something, wave hands around randomly]... A!!!,1,aww
I crye,1,aww
There's hope for humanity yet. Things like this make me sure of it.,1,aww
heart-warming; kudos to the teacher and those great kids,1,aww
Do they teach SL in all schools? I was taught SL at school.,1,aww
No sound on this video. Can you re-upload?,1,aww
I love it,1,aww
Thank you for that,1,aww
But I can't hear them sing.. Oh.,1,aww
Thank you OP for calling them Custodians. My mother was one and when some student asked for a 'Janitor' she would say "there are no Janitors. I don't know if you'll find any Janitors around here.",1,aww
Awww so sweet.,1,aww
Cryin,1,aww
Holyshit the world is beautiful!!!,1,aww
This could be a very beautiful moment in a film.,1,aww
tath is awesome,1,aww
What is this wetness around my eyes? The fuck?,1,aww
This made my decade,1,aww
Custodians are unsung heroes.,1,aww
Video with sound??,1,aww
What seems to be the problem with custodian's walking ?,1,aww
Where's the volume?,1,aww
Ah man, I remember my janitor from elementary school. Every kid thought he was the coolest,1,aww
Fuck i love these videos. I remember when I was a freshman my school was teying to move Larry, this really cool janitor to another school so we all signed a petition to keep him so he stayed! He was so happy.,1,aww
Reminds me of the comic where one parent says to do well in school or be a janitor; the other parent says do well in school and make the world better for them.The first thing I do when I take a teaching position is find custodial and office staff and get to know them. They deserve respect and have secret powers--like the power to fast-track requests.,1,aww
This is awesome!!,1,aww
I can't keep crying at the office with this videos...,1,aww
In a world that sometimes seems filled with monsters and evil, it's good to remember that there are teachers, kids with kind hearts, and others, who will reach out and make sure everyone feels love and gets included in the community.,1,aww

What I would give to have the silent Happy Birthday song go mainstream.  It almost makes it bearable for everyone.,1,aww

First thing I saw when I opened up Reddit today. Truly started my day with wholesomeness, thank you,1,aww
This is a fantastic lesson to teach kids. Appreciate and respect those who work for you and/or work to make your lives better.,1,aww
I thought he was wearing a fake taxi tshirt,1,aww
This is the most heartwarming video, I have ever seen. Made my day. <3,1,aww
Reminds me of Fonzie on Happy Days, learning how to sing Happy Birthday to his hard of hearing girlfriend, and Richie teaches him some ASL![Happy Born Day To You!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGHwtVCqSwc) - Henry Winkler, master of his craft.,1,aww
I hope “make grand gestures to your custodian” is the new “thank your bus driver”.,1,aww

In elementary school I always loved the custodian! Mr. Ken! He was THE MAN! I'm not sure why, but all the kids loved him. He was just an average, nice dude but all the students treated him like a hero. One time a bunch of kids put tar all over the playset and I stayed after school to keep him company cleaning it. Mom was really mad because I didn't check in... And got covered in tar. Glad he didn't get in trouble!,1,aww
This is tier two of thanking the busdriver,1,aww
This is actually the most precious thing I’ve ever seen.,1,aww
But why is there no volume?,1,aww
That probably made this man’s year!,1,aww
Love this.,1,aww

Don’t know why i expected this to have sound....,1,aww
When our custodian drove our band a few hours away (for free, he insisted we didn't pay him) we tried to be nice and my music teacher paid for his hotel room. He paid her back anyway. JUST ACCEPT OUR KINDNESS AND $140!,1,aww
That's awesome,1,aww
Needed this today..,1,aww
Perfect timing to get off reddit. Thanks to pinko. This was absolutely beautiful.,1,aww
Beautiful,1,aww
This is beautiful,1,aww
Love this! Made my day.,1,aww
Someone once told me to imagine sign language was actually just gang signs and I haven’t been the same since.,1,aww
Soooo cute!!! Precious!! 😀😀😀😀😀,1,aww
The asynchronous way they are signing looks like what it would sound like if they were actually singing.,1,aww
My mom’s a custodian at a highschool and it means the world to them when people do small things like say hi, or acknowledge them. They work so hard moving desks and tables and waxing floors and cleaning the building. Some assholes piss on the floors, shit on the floor, put cans in the toilet and shit on it. People can be real assholes and they’re the unsung heroes of the workplace. So when you see a custodian just say thanks for what they do, you’ll see it means a lot to people like them.,1,aww
I can make the blood gang sign,1,aww
This is beautiful,1,aww
I didn't hear anything.,1,aww
My highschool had 3 janitors, one of them was my aunt so I got to know them well, they joked that they all preferred to be called custodial engineers, that legitimately made me rethink everything about 'janitors', now I only call them custodial engineers,1,aww
So sweet!!,1,aww
Does someone have sound? I can't hear a thing.,1,aww
Reminds me of our custodian at my elementary school.  "Mac" always had a big smile, never had a cross word to say.  We all adored him but I am sure he is long gone by now.  He brought so much joy to so many kids.,1,aww
Need the sound fixed on this video, I can't hear anything.,1,aww

This is how you make a grown man cry in front of children,1,aww
What is a custodian? Think they are called something else where I live? (Scotland),1,aww
I’m not crying you are! (I actually generated tears watching this),1,aww
I was about to turn up the sound in the video... then I remembered.,1,aww
Best part is most of those kids will always remember how to sign this.,1,aww
Would have been better if the video had audio.Even subtitles or something.,1,aww
My father is a custodian and he has worked at several schools and it’s just so wholesome when he gets letters from students thanking him.,1,aww
Funeral yesterday...wasn't supposed to cry today.  I'll take it, though. =),1,aww

This is why I love Reddit. Right in the feels!,1,aww
A happy and excited custodian usually seems to indicate happy and excited kids and teachers.,1,aww
Where is the sound?!,1,aww
What does a custodian do?,1,aww
This warms my heart.,1,aww
That's beautiful,1,aww

I think it's suitable that this video has no sound,1,aww
Some of those kids aren't even doing anything lmao and some of the ones that are just haphazardly doing shit with their hands until it's time to point,1,aww

I'm browsing reddit drunk and at first glance this looked like they dabbed on him sorry,1,aww
This is great. I try to get to know everyone's name at work because I don't want them to feel left out or not acknowledged. I mean some of my coworkers don't know the name of the guy (Chris) who empties their trash cans everyday and it's like a pet peeve of mine.,1,aww
Oh... well I'm gonna cry.,1,aww
This was so cute :),1,aww

Growing up in a deaf household these type of videos always get to me... good on this teacher.,1,aww
No audio? Oh wait...Great video, stuff like this makes me happy<3 and I hope these kids will keep thanking custodians and other works because they deserve recognition :D,1,aww

A video. https://youtu.be/bvWaYMgmWooI just picked one I didn't check who uploaded it first. Thought you'd guys enjoy sound.,1,aww
I hate it when people don't upload videos with the sound on,1,aww
What a nice thing to wake up too! Love it,1,aww
During Jr High and High school, I had the honor to know school custodian's who sort of doubled as psych counselors and generally good advisors on how to live in the real world.  The door to the 'janitor closet' was always open, and there was always and empty chair and a willing ear.  And sometimes a bucket of the nasty stuff used to clean up puke too.,1,aww
Where's the audio?,1,aww
That's awesome.Bet that made his day.,1,aww
Things I've learned since high school. Always make friends with the janitorial staff, it becomes a mutually beneficial relationship that will save both your butts more times then you care to count.,1,aww
Where is the version with audio?,1,aww
It’s amazing little gestures like these that keep me from feeling totally defeated by the current state of the world. Love this so much.,1,aww
This is the best thing. <3 This teacher really taught them a valuable lesson. His reaction is adorable!,1,aww

Related story. One of my nieces is deaf. We went for her 3rd or 4th birthday. Most of her friends at the birthday party were also deaf. Now when the cake cutting was gonna happen I was talking to some relative, and before I could start clapping based on whenever I hear the usual “ Happppppppyy birthdayyyyyy....” the thing was over. I got confused as to what just happened and then I realized, these kids sang in ASL, and obviously didn’t clap because they don’t have to make clapping sound and more obviously their hands were busy signing Happy Birthday in sign language. Long story short, I felt happy for my deaf niece after I realized that she has her own cute little world with friends who love her a lot.Even after watching this video, I felt the something similar. First I wished it had sound but then I realized that these are people from my niece’s cute little world.,1,aww
I need this with sound because I can't hear the song,1,aww
just woke up and reddit has me crying why???,1,aww

Thanks for this. I heard the story on the radio and said he was blind. I had a lot of questions.,1,aww
That kind of news keeps my hope for humanity afloat.,1,aww
Is it insensitive to ask for a link with sound?,1,aww
Glad to see kids are treating cleaning personnel better these days, atleast some anyway.  My granddad was a janitor at a school and every day kids would smear shit on the walls and purposely piss on the floor and sometimes they would get creative and shit in the sink. That's why i refuse to accept contracts with schools now, they pay more usually but the work is 10 times harder because of kids not understanding how to keep their enviroment clean and they don't understand another person has to clean up what they don't. Schools are the quickest way to get employees to quit because it's too much, so i just don't accept their contracts.,1,aww
Lol looks like it's a new trend to see which elementary school can get the most likes being nice to their custodian. Is it just me, or does recording a kind act subtracts a significant amount of genuineness?,1,aww
something something Sony something something copyright claim.,1,aww
Thats amazing!,1,aww
We never amounted to this but everyone loved our custodian back in elementary school,1,aww
This is awesome! Finally a post on AWWW that doesn't involve dogs.,1,aww
This is awesome, I bet this made his day.,1,aww
Can we get the video with audio?,1,aww
My grandpa was also a deaf custodian - this is really special,1,aww
So amazing and cute. However Really should have blurred the kids faces. Unless all of their parents signed consent forms. I feel like people do not take into account privacy in or modern age.,1,aww

One of the reasons I started taking ASL was because I was going to be a traveling nurse. I never did, but I did continue with ASL.I wanted to travel the US and help those who weren't understood. To help those who needed support in hospitals that couldnt give them enough attention.My professor who taught me ASL told me those who are Deaf/hearing impaired have issues with hospitals because they dont feel properly represented. Since then whenever I'm working it always makes my day knowing I can help someone in ASL. Its never expected and it brings a big smile to their face.,1,aww

That is hilarious.  My old boy would have done that if he could.  He was a black lab that would spend all day hanging out in the snowy yard when it was 15 degrees F.,694,aww
He’s just cooling off after sweeps last March I think it was. Somehow the end of the video was cut off but he does flip himself over and starts running again.  Follow him on Instagram: @truckeetheavalanchedog  I have the full video uploaded there. I try to keep it exciting but he’s always at work in the winter w his dad, and guys don’t remember to post badass pictures to Instagram. Lol Glad you all like the video.  There’s no cliff, it’s off Ridge Run at Heavenly when he was working at Sky Patrol. Sometimes he just slides down the mountain at the end of the day, sometimes he jogs slowly side to side so it’s not hard on his body, other times he’s on the back of a sled or loads up on my bf’s shoulders. Cheers everyone.,218,aww

This is why I want another dog. My pup is very high energy and we cant always meet his needs. If we got him a buddy and a doggy door to let them roam our backyard and play, he would never look sad ever again,1,aww

Lucky kitty! So sweet!,1,aww
That's too much. I'm pretty sure that video just broke me. The amount of Aww+animals being bros+cute+StopIt!!! Resulted in, what seems to be, a system shut down. It was a good way to go, though. Too bad I never got to se,1,aww
That dog didn't care that he laid on the ball,1,aww

He was truly my best friend and has been with me through everything. I thought watching this would make it worse but it might be the first time I've actually smiled since last week. Thank you.,1,aww

Makes sense. Dogs are already predisposed to follow the alpha of the pack. They may vie for dominance, but eventually, one of them submits, the other being the dominant. But cats don’t follow anyone, bring largely solitary predators. They will fight, and if necessary, often to the death. So if there is a fight for dominance, the dog will submit usually before the cat,1,aww
This cured all that ails me,1,aww

This is so strange. My mother shared a different video of this same cat and one of the dogs in the same house. I could tell by the collar on the kitty and tiles on the floor.For the record, the dog grabbed kitty by the scruff of his neck and dragged him along the floor to where he wanted him. Kitty didn't mind.,1,aww

Goldens are the best!,1,aww

A friend of mine in the 80's used to breed these dogs. They are Samoyeds and as beautiful as they are they the sort of dog that only people that obsess about their dogs should keep. Not only do they do they have that fur to maintain but they are a working dog and need an active owner. They also like company so having just one is only a good option for people that have someone at home most of the time. They are stunning though.,102,aww

That's the best!! I always loved being able to just leave my windows wide open like that with the malamutes inside.  Wide, wide open.  Life was so good to them they never even considered climbing out :)  Just like these 3,2,aww
I would have to beg the owner to shoot me too, these guys look like too much fun...,2,aww
Don't know where you are from, but that is not a snowstorm around these parts.,2,aww
It wouldn't matter what kinda crappy day I was having, this would instantly make it better.,2,aww
My two American Akita’s will do the same thing! They get pissed if I have the heat on in the car no matter how cold it is outside. Coldest we’ve been in was -6° and while I could barely walk straight, they were wrestling and having the time of their lives. I love dogs.,2,aww
They left the window open, what's wrong with this? My border collie has the answer: not enough snow in the car.Also, the one in the middle looks like he's been smushed before, knew it was coming, accepted his fate and then changed his mind.,2,aww
Really cloudy outside,2,aww
At first glance I thought all their heads were poking out of the same T-shirt, whilst hanging out the window..the actual result is still equally as cute,2,aww
Middle dog is either thinking"I fucking hate these guys"or "I fucking love these guys",2,aww

I once lived in the highest town in the US, well over 10K elevation.  Saw it snow every month of the year.  I had a Samoyed, smartest dog I ever owned.  It could be well below zero F, with feet of snow on the ground, and he would refuse to come in.,1,aww

COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
Dogs have a sense of justice. I used to have three dogs. The oldest needed a daily pill so every night around 9pm I would cut up a hot dog in chunks and cut a slit in one to put the pill into. Of course the other two dogs *also* had to have a hot dog chunk. I eventually lost the older dog when he was 14-1/2, but I kept giving the other two dogs pieces of hot dogs every night at 9pm because they expected it.    So then I got a puppy near the end of January, and I was giving all three dogs pieces of hot dog around 9pm. But in early February one of my older dogs passed away, and then at the end of July I lost the other one. It's been a very difficult couple years. But every night my puppy gets some pieces of hot dog around 9pm and I think about my old boys.  **EDIT**     Wow, I *never* expected my little story to blow up like this. Thanks everyone! For anyone who may be interested, here are some photos of my late boys:     [Joshua, my first dog, on his 14th birthday](https://i.imgur.com/9f1fhGg.jpg). He died about 6 months later, Nov 29, 2016. This is the dog who actually *needed* to take a pill!       [This is Buddy and new puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/DgeBj6T.jpg), at the end of January. Buddy passed away from kidney failure three days after this photo. Poor Jericho only got to know him for a few days but adored him, and for several days after Buddy passed Jericho would sleep in the spot where Buddy always slept.     [Harlan with puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/om5uDhM.jpg). We lost Harlan 6 months later at the end of July due to bone cancer in the leg. Jericho was very fond of Harlan, too.     Poor Jericho loved both his big brothers and now he's an only child. And a big one, I don't have a current picture but he turned 9 months old a couple weeks ago and weighed in at 94 lbs!,5278,aww

The first dog can smell that the other one didn't get the ear stuff. It knows the other dog got bamboozled,13542,aww
Where the fuck do you find dogs that are willing to take ear medicine like that? I had to chase my cocker spaniel all over the house to catch him for his ear meds, and it took two of us to hold him in place to administer it.,3062,aww
Just as adorable is OP's "squirt, squirt, squirt" when applying the second medicine.,4069,aww
All three of my dogs come for medication time. Only one gets meds but they all get cheese,292,aww
Its important to them to be treated equally. Its in the doggy bill of rights.,16805,aww
Labs are such teddy bears. So sweet and happy,322,aww
Parenting Done Right 😍,1207,aww
The way that man's face instantly goes from super serious man handling medicine to mischievous 5y/o is amazing!,111,aww
I bet that guy is a great dad,324,aww
awwww. i never comment on pet things. but awwww.,1292,aww
Oh wow!  I almost have to sit on my dog to put his ear medication in. I’ve tried everything and it’s still a huge battle.,79,aww
That's the cutest thing ever, and I can't share it through text thanks to Reddit's player. :\,324,aww
my name is dogbut cannot hearonce everydayput drop in ear  my doggy frendoes not need medbut still want dropto rub his head,999,aww
So adorable! " squirt squirt squirt ".,49,aww
Oh my goodness! I thought my younger dog might be the only one who was pretty sure she also needed medication (eye drops) when the older one did.   I also had to put the lid on and pretend to drop some in her eyes, as well as make a big deal over what a good girl she was, too.  It may have also had something to do with the fact that she might have worried without the "drops" she might get a good girl cookie as well.  Dogs never cease to amaze me.,47,aww
My old buddy had lots of problems with his floppy ears and had to have ear medicine sometimes. He hated it. But he knew it helped. So whenever we see him scratching his ear too much we'll get up and grab the bottle. He'll run off and keep the dining table between him and me. After a few minutes he'll come up to me and sit. Once I squirt the medicine in and do some massage he'll run off and do some zoomies, roll around on his bed and make these adorable frustrated noises. Finally he'd come back and demand treats for being a good boy.But he would feel much better the next day,46,aww
The second knows he doesn’t need medicine. What he needs is them sweet sweet ear rubs.,79,aww
i am dog onewith ear that hurtsmy daddy givesthe little squirtsam second dogmy ear is finei want the squirts -please, dad, do mine!we lucky dogswith Loving dad -Best Medicinewe ever had!,1091,aww
Omg. This is too good,33,aww
I had a really bad day personally and professionally and i really needed to smile. Thank you OP ❤️,29,aww
This is so awesome! I am in love with this man for humoring this dog with the "squirt squirt squirt". This kind of thing speaks to someone's character, that he is willing to make that little gesture to acknowledge and appease this dogs quirky need to get the ear drops. Kudos to him!,26,aww
This just reminded me of something I had forgotten about. My grandpa used to give my grandma eye drops every day. When he would do that, their border collie would jump in the chair and wait for her turn. He'd put the cap on the bottle and pretend to put drops her eyes while she tilted her head back. This was 15+ years ago, and they've all passed away now. Thank you for reminding me of that memory.,22,aww
Big, goofy Labs are the best. I like how Dog #1 (Katie?) returned to make sure Dog #2 (Josh?) wasn't getting anything special on the down low, and Dog #2 is simply happy to be there for the ear rubs.The owner's great, too. "Squirt, squirt, squirt... all done!"/wigglebutts intensify,21,aww
Nawww he is just fakin and wants some ear scratches. lol,39,aww
That is one great dog dad.,18,aww
1st dog- "you know he bamboozled you, right?"  2nd dog- "doesn't matter, got scritches"  They both just seem happy to be involved, lol,15,aww
God I love that shit eating grin as he rubs the second dog's ears. Good dad.,13,aww
The second dog gets up like "Huzzah! I am cured!!!"I've died of happiness.,28,aww
I think he's just doing it for the ear rubs. Smart doggo.,23,aww
Haha! I love the sound effects! “Squirt, squirt, squirt”,11,aww
HECKIN GOOD BOIS 10/10 WOULD BOOP,11,aww
The look on the man's face, and the satisfaction of equality on the dogs is priceless (especially since he got TWICE the dose. Tsk tsk!).,11,aww
I totally believe this.My mom’s dog once needed eye drops. I watched her administer them and then she pretended to give them to other pup. I laughed and asked her why she does this and she explained he gets upset because he feels left out.,10,aww
I used to have to give my Welsh Springer Spaniel haircuts every summer, and I’d finish shaving her then dutifully “shave” my black lab who had so patiently waited for her turn and was seething with jealousy.,9,aww
My dog needs ear medication and I chase him for 30 minutes trying to put the stuff in his ears. These are good dogs,10,aww
“Omg it worked, I tricked him, I got petted” 🐶,9,aww
Aww and Dad plays along,9,aww
That is so fucking adorable,8,aww
That good boi is no dummy.  He gets ear skritches too!,8,aww
Why can’t humans be as good as dogs,7,aww

Adorable.   I lost my best mate Aibo (12 yr Lab ret) earlier this year. I miss him everyday. Miss ya buddy 🌹,13,aww
Aw! What a great dad!,5,aww
This is the best thing I've seen all day I love this,6,aww
Same with my labs. One gets pain meds for her hips and everyone gets "medicine" (totally just balled up cheese).,6,aww
Awe, I have a chocolate lab and a Habanesse. The lab has ear medicine and hates it so whenever I give it to him the small one starts licking his ears because he thinks he’s in pain lol too cute,6,aww
We have a dog who needs eyedrops and another who doesn’t.During medication time, dog 1 gets eyedrops then dog 2 watches and asks for some.Once dog 1 is done, we hold dog 2 in position for receiving eyedrops. We then touch the bottom of the vial to the top of her head and she’s happy and believes she’s received her medication.,5,aww
My dog does the same thing. One has to have a skin treatment nightly. He hates it. Even though the first dog fusses and squirms through the whole thing, my other dog comes and parks it right in front of me as soon as the first dog leaves. I just rub her skin like I do his, pat her butt, and call her a good girl.,6,aww
The level of trust from the dogs is just amazing.Back when my dog had diabetes, he trusted us so much, and when it came to insulin, he would lay down for the shot when it was that time of the day.He was such a good boy, sure do miss him.,5,aww
The first dog came back around and took a few sniffs and called bullshit on the con job.,6,aww
I love animals so goddamn much.,5,aww
The old man trying to hold back his smile is so endearing.  What good dogs and a good owner, you can tell they are loved.,5,aww
This is so fucking adorable I can’t even stand it. As an animal nurse, that is not just one but two polite doggies. Good boyes alert!,4,aww
He puts his hands up, that's how you know it's legit.,5,aww
Everyday I see more and more proof of dogs being the silliest and goofiest and most innocent and most loving creatures 🙂,4,aww
Oh my gosh! My mom does the same thing with her two little dogs. One needs medicine, and then the other she has to fake put drops in, “Boop Boop Boop!” And then he runs off and shakes his head like he actually got them put in. He’s reacting to fake drops!,5,aww
I have been in a grumpy mood since coming from work but this wee clip really made me smile,6,aww
Love the dogs and the Guy !,6,aww
I wish i had a dad like those dogs have.,4,aww
Such a good girl and good boy Awwwwh,4,aww
Omg I miss my dog so much. I'm on a business trip and had a nightmare about my dog.,3,aww
I have a cat like this. He sits there and watches us with his head tilted while we give medicine to one cat and then he waits patiently for us to pick him up and give it to him as well.,5,aww
I wish my dogs sat there for ear medicine, I have to wrestle my basset hound to the ground and sit on her to give her meds.,3,aww
I had two dogs. An old one that needed medication and a young one that didn't. We'd give them both "medicine" every morning and evening (the old one would get actual medicine, the young one would get a small treat)  The older one has been gone 5 years, the younger one still with us still expects "medicine" you can't call it a treat or he won't take it. Has to be called "medicine",4,aww
My dog can't be quiet when he sees me putting make up on and I don't pretend to put some on him too.,5,aww
You must be mistaken. That's not medicine. That's EAR TREATS.,5,aww
My dogs are like this. They don't like being brushed or getting their nails clipped individually but if the two of them are together they fight for the privilege.,4,aww
When you give your younger sibiling an unplugged controller so he can "play" games with you.,3,aww
How sweet is that!,4,aww
My mom's puppy has severe hip dysplasia (German Shepherd and mastiff(?) mix) and he had surgery at 9 months old to fix it. After his surgery he was limping and getting pain meds. My dog, being the princess she is, was jealous of all the attention the puppy was getting, so she lifted one of her paws and limped around the house to make us think she was hurt too. We knew she was full of bull because she's done this before AND forgets what paw she 'injured'. Also whenever one of our dogs needs a pill, everybody gets a treat because otherwise they get jealous. And my mom used to own a grumpy old Collie who was smart enough to know when he was getting medication and would eat the treat and spit out the pill, so we would give all the dogs a treat to fool him into thinking it was treats time instead of pill time. Actually worked pretty well! He's been gone for 3 years now but we still do that with all our dogs whenever one needs medicine.BTW: the puppy is 1 year 3 months and he's doing great. He's finally acting like a silly crazy puppy now that he's not in pain anymore. He thinks my brother's lab/ pit mix is his mom, even though she's half his size.,2,aww
Kinda like having kids no? 😂,4,aww
Squirt, Squirt, Squirt. :D,8,aww
All doggo knows is their frien is getting earrubz, and wants earrubz too. I don't blame him.,12,aww
Solitary. I've never commented in r/awe, but that is some cute stuff right there.,3,aww
Dang. My dogs all run when they see that little bottle.,3,aww
So pure.,3,aww
Brilliant. My dogs will run and hide when I bring out the meds. I guess it's all about the technique. You make it really worth it with that massive ear massage,3,aww
This is beautiful,3,aww
r/likeus,3,aww
nothing is a bigger deal to my dog than ear meds, holy jeez she goes nuts (Golden retriever),3,aww
Jesus christ. Reddit video is horrendous. The only video platform that takes 30 seconds to play and then pauses in the middle. USE GFYCAT.,3,aww
My pup has problems with ear infections so we regularly need to squirt a solution in his ears to keep them clean and healthy. I wish it was this easy with him! Nothing but a battle as he tries to get away. I don’t blame him though, I wouldn’t want someone squirting shit into my ears on a regular basis either.,3,aww
The way he said "All done" hahaha,3,aww
First time I actually said aww outloud,3,aww
Such a GOOD BOI!,3,aww
If this was on YouTube, there would be a DMCA takedown request for the TV playing in the background.,3,aww
That’s has to be the cutest video to date. Seriously. This takes the cake.,3,aww
I wish my dog was like that. It was like trying to ride an unwilling horse through the house last night putting his drops in.,3,aww
This is a man with a good heart in this video.,3,aww
It's like toddler rules but with dogs,3,aww
AWWDUNN,3,aww
Can’t get over Dad lookin around trying to hold in his laughter.,3,aww
This is like when one of my dogs gets wet and gets toweled off the dry dog comes over to be toweled too.,3,aww
I love dogs.... seriously the best thing mankind has done, taming wild dogs.....,3,aww
What beautiful intuitive creatures. They love their person and just want to know he loves them back. Pure love.,3,aww
Today I bought a present for a 4 year old... and threw in something for his older brother.  Feels like the same thing.,3,aww
Gotta love a big sweet Lab.,3,aww
This is ridiculously sweet. The father human's smile makes it for me.,3,aww
I love this video so much. Especially when the guys throws his hands up and says ALL DONE,3,aww
Equal rights for all pups,3,aww
That man was being adorableEdit: I also love how dogs or animals can expect attention by sitting still and close, not looking directly at you or facing you but giving glances kind of awkwardly.. just waiting for their turn at affection,3,aww
Nothing better than Labs !  So sweet,3,aww
One of my friends had a German Shepard, when he was about eight years old my friend got a new German Shepard pup.  The older one was grazed by a car and had a slight limp but he was ok.  Soon the pup started limping too with the same back leg.  My friend took the pup to the vet to get him checked out but the vet said he was fine, nothing wrong.  So this new pup was just learning to limp because of the other dog.,3,aww
That smile from the human is fucking heart meltingso genuine and free,3,aww
Oh dogs ❤️,3,aww
u/kissdogs,3,aww
My pup gets so mad that he doesn’t get insulin shots like his diabetic brother twice a day 🙄,3,aww
I had a dog that needed a shot of insulin 2x a day. I always gave them to her right as she started eating. The other dog wouldn't eat unless she got a shot too, so I used a syringe that hadn't been used and with the top on, pretended to get her medicine too. She then ate real good. After my older one passed away, the other dog to this day will not eat unless she gets her medicine. Give her her shot and she'll eat, otherwise she'll sit and stare at you until she gets it...so silly.,3,aww
There is something actually really beautiful about this,3,aww
He thinkin bout them pets,5,aww
“Squirt squirt squirt”... Is he trying to fool the dog or himself?,4,aww
I cannot upvote this enough. Warmed my cockles.,5,aww

JESUS MY HEART,2,aww
THESE DOGS ARE SO WELL BEHAVED,2,aww
The excited wagging of the tail gets me every time,2,aww
My dog need to have ear medication when my sisters dog was visiting. My dog hates having her ears cleaned and my sisters dog needed to have medication for his ears before, so when he saw me giving my dog the stuff he ran and hid.,2,aww
DOGS!!,2,aww
My lab runs under the table when I take out the ear meds.  I have to take out the peanut butter and he knows that he only gets the PB if he lets me give him the ear meds.,2,aww
Anything for ear rubs.,2,aww
My doxie boi Frank the Tank just had back surgery last week. I have another doxie that thinks he need to do physical therapy after I finish with Frank. It’s hysterical!https://i.imgur.com/u7TYGn8.jpg there they are!,2,aww
I dont care about the drugs, i just want the hugs,2,aww
Those dogs suit that owner as far as the owners look like their pets thing.,2,aww
I wish i had a dad like those dogs have.,2,aww
Well that’s nice. Mine looks at me like I’m going to murder her when I bust out the ear drops.,2,aww
I have to clean my cat’s ear daily, followed by a treat for being a good boy.Recently got a kitten and he wants treats too, so he also get’s a q-tip on the outside of his ear canal, he’s calm and quiet for them treats.,2,aww
Man, my dog needed medicine like this - we had to double team, one person holding treats the other doing the ear thing.,2,aww
me when I want to feel included,2,aww
Such a brave strong doggo,2,aww
This absolutely made my day.,2,aww
Vote for best dog owner!,2,aww
I love this. Dogs are the best,2,aww
Perfect.,2,aww
The second dog has you bamboozled for free ear rubs and you think he's the one who's bamboozled??? He's one step ahead. If anyone's bamboozled, it's definitely you. Bamboozled.,2,aww
I wish my dog took his ear meds that well!!! The minute   It comes out he try’s to hide his head in the couch or beneath his blanket. And lord help us if he sees the wash and the cleaner sticks come out!,2,aww
I wish my dog was that good at taking ear medicine 😭😭😭,2,aww
This is absolutely adorable.  <3  On a serious note though, I just wanted to warn everyone that some ear treatment antibiotics can cause irreversible hearing damage in your dogs.  We took our Bull Terrier in about 6 months ago because she had sudden hearing loss only to find out the veterinarian who we saw her the appointment before prescribed an ointment for a "possible" ear infection that wasn't necessary in the first place.  Our dog's actual problem was ruptured ear drums, not sure why or how it happened, and the ointment went into the holes, got infected and caused her to go deaf.  We tried general anesthesia and a cleaning treatment to get some hearing back, but it failed.  Before a vet gives you ear treatment, have them check the eardrum.  We did it for years with multiple dogs and never had an issue, but it only took one time to change her life forever.You can read about other instances online if you're interested.,2,aww
I did it all for the scritches..,2,aww
this is so cute,2,aww
Lol, the second dog reminds me of Michael Scott,2,aww
My guys did the exact same thing when one of them needed eye drops!  I had to fake giving eye drops to the other one.,2,aww
Look at him stoickly waiting. Goodboye means business .,2,aww
Where's the person with the poem?,2,aww
We don’t deserve dogs 😭,2,aww
Placeboggo,2,aww
We really don't deserve dogs, too pure!,2,aww
My dog does this every time too! It just melts my heart.,2,aww
Hahaha cute,2,aww
My dogs growing up did this! Of course they were labs,2,aww
Dogs are the best,2,aww
This is ADORABLE! He waits so patently for his turn.,2,aww
+1 goodboy point,2,aww
What a great pet owner!!,2,aww
Very sweet. Both the dogs and their owner!,2,aww
So cute it made my day...,2,aww
This is the most Labrador thing I’ve ever seen,2,aww
Oh man. This brought back nightmares. We had a 17.5 lb old tomcat that was formerly feral as a pet. He had ear wax problems so got ear infections a few times. I recall working up a sweat and having my muscles be sore the next morning wrestling him with my partner to keep him down to even get a bit of a squirt in an ear. Its amazing what a defense an under 20lb animal can put up,2,aww
Seriously how lucky are we to have dogs in our lives. I love them so much.,2,aww
Why are dogs so much better than humans?,2,aww
Haha reminds me of one of my pups. We have an (almost) 8 year old Bernese and a rescue berner we adopted a few years ago. The rescue has a bunch of health issues and always needs something new. For example, we got her a food bowl shaped like a maze because she used to eat extremely fast when we fed her. My other dog just HAD to try out her bowl. She was infatuated with it. Now she's having leg problems and got a new harness that helps us lift her back end up so she can walk easier. Other pup just HAD to try it out. She's a character... Just can't have something new without her being in on it.,2,aww
This was me with middle child syndrome! Lol. But not as cute!,2,aww
“All done!” The best part haha,2,aww
As a vet, this is actually the best animal video I have ever seen.Absolute gold.,2,aww
He just wants special ear petting too.,2,aww
It's because dogs get endorphin pumps from ear rubs. Peddling cuteness for affection.....dirty, rotten, scoundrels.,2,aww
Are dogs even human?,2,aww
Dogs are about the best beings on earth.,2,aww
When my dog smell me grabbing the bottle she hide under the table. She hate that stuff,2,aww
What's the ear medicine for anyways?,2,aww
ALL DOONNE! Everyone involved is so cute!,2,aww
Every time I send home ear meds, I'm going to hope this is what goes on.,2,aww
It felt like the doggy wanted the ear rub and not the medicine part,2,aww
I wish my cats were this easy to give medicine too! Rather than cue up, they run off to the four corners of the earth. 😕,2,aww
Good dogs :),2,aww
What a sweet man,2,aww
scammed,2,aww
lmao I never thought this could happen cuz whenever I'm dealing with an animal the others suddenly disappear off the face of the earth 🤣,2,aww
Dogs are just the purest creatures on this planet.,2,aww
That's one of the cutest things I've ever seen.,2,aww
Can somebody explain to me what war medicine is? I know very little about ears so my knowledge is that they come in 4 states: can hear everything, can hear everything with hearing aids, can hear  an annoying constant ringing, and can’t hear anything. This is all based on human ears so if this is a dog specific thing, I’d love to know why they have ear medicine.,2,aww
I want to marry that guy!,2,aww
My turn my turn!,2,aww
I just found out how much better it is with sound! :),2,aww
My mom's puppy has severe hip dysplasia (German Shepherd and mastiff(?) mix) and he had surgery at 9 months old to fix it. After his surgery he was limping and getting pain meds. My dog, being the princess she is, was jealous of all the attention the puppy was getting, so she lifted one of her paws and limped around the house to make us think she was hurt too. We knew she was full of bull because she's done this before AND forgets what paw she 'injured'. Also whenever one of our dogs needs a pill, everybody gets a treat because otherwise they get jealous. And my mom used to own a grumpy old Collie who was smart enough to know when he was getting medication and would eat the treat and spit out the pill, so we would give all the dogs a treat to fool him into thinking it was treats time instead of pill time. Actually worked pretty well! He's been gone for 3 years now but we still do that with all our dogs whenever one needs medicine.BTW: the puppy is 1 year 3 months and he's doing great. He's finally acting like a silly crazy puppy now that he's not in pain anymore. He thinks my brother's lab/ pit mix is his mom, even though she's half his size.,2,aww
I heard some where that ears rubbing is like sex massage for dog,2,aww
Good on everyone to play along!,4,aww
Dogs are the cutest creatures.,2,aww
Wow dogs really are the best. 😭,4,aww

I suddenly want two giant yellow labs.,1,aww
So wholesome!,1,aww
Such a golden retriever thing to do, I love them.,1,aww
And over here, I can't get either one of my two ear-problem-pups to sit still. I end up tasting it every time, as they fling the crap everywhere from shaking their heads before I can take my hand away.,1,aww
GIVE ME BELLY RUBS OR GIVE ME TREATS!!,1,aww
Eff I can't even get my dog to sit still for a second so I can put the darn drops in his ears. You know it's a struggle when not even a treat is of help.,1,aww
ALL DONE,1,aww
Doggy cargo cult.,1,aww
Labs ears need constant cleaning.,1,aww
So sweet... like little children,1,aww
That bud got easily fooled.,1,aww
I wish it was this easy to treat my dogs ears instead of having a wrestle match with her.,1,aww

I think it comes down to attention. I have a cat that requires asthmatic medication and the other one always wonders why I seek her out specifically.,1,aww
Haha our Bassetts are like that too!,1,aww
The dog's thinking, those are funny squirt noises,1,aww
Dog low key just wants it’s ears rubbed,1,aww

He just wanted those sweet ear rubs.,1,aww
Aww, she just wants some attention too. So sweet.,1,aww
How come he was patiently waiting for his turn. My dog does not even stay still for the ear medicine!,1,aww
Awww! I walk a lab and he's needs ear drops at the moment too. I wish he was as calm about it as this dude! He loves it when I rub his ears though, as the yeast infection he has makes them super itchy.,1,aww
My turn, my turn!!,1,aww
/r/woof_irl,1,aww
My god you are so lucky she stays still!!! Impossible with my guy.,1,aww
THE BEST,1,aww

A Team,1,aww
Pupper just wanted an ear massage. Dogs love them. I give them to my pups regularly.,1,aww

Doggo also wants the pats,1,aww
God I love dogs.,1,aww
This is the best thing I saw on Reddit today! Please post more of these two.,1,aww
He’s just there for the ear rubs :),1,aww
Dad should put a drop or two in one ear one time so you can record pupper's surprised reaction.,1,aww
So cute,1,aww
That guy is awesome.,1,aww
Nah he just wants the ear massage,1,aww
Ggk,1,aww
I freaking love animals.,1,aww
All dogs are created equal was the first statement in the Doglaration of Independence,.,1,aww
Little does anyone know he’s only doing it for the ear scritches!,1,aww
Are we all really about to act like that good boye didn't know exactly what he was doing?He just wanted the scritches, and knows that cuteness cuts straight to our hearts.,1,aww
My dog does this when I give my kids their meds. He wants meds too.,1,aww
Omg that is too cute!!,1,aww
Oh my goodness, that was too adorable! What a good boy ♥️,1,aww
All the other dog wants is to get the same amount of attention, basically. Adorable little attention hogs.,1,aww
Lol! He’s just in it for the massage.,1,aww
This is not my dogs. They’d smell that medicine and run and hide. Ear rubs be damned!,1,aww
The things that parents do for their children....or it could just be that the other dog wants an ear rub and attention also? Either way, the deal or pact between owner and dog is really cute and funny!,1,aww
I’m saving this post because it makes me feel all fuzzy.,1,aww
Too pure,1,aww
One of my dog is on CBD and the other one just wants what her big brother have. So now I have 2 dogs on CBD!,1,aww
My dog loves getting his Mometamax when he needs it. Its super soothing for them.,1,aww
My dog would whine and hide when he needed ear drops...he HATED them. He would tuck himself under the coffee table so we couldn't get to his ears.,1,aww
Thank you for treating them equally!!!,1,aww
It's all about the ear rubs afterwards.,1,aww
I give little white dog her pills in  a  bit of peanut butter, little brown dog also gets peanut butter at the same time.  Getting him in the habit in case he needs pills some day.,1,aww
I love the fact he pretended for him..awww,1,aww
dogs are just the best!,1,aww
My aunt's dogs are this way with insulin shots. One of them is going blind and needs insulin for diabetes and the other doesn't, but has always been very close to his brother so after one gets the shot, my aunt pretend pokes him too every single day. Ra so sweet!,1,aww
Or he's just here for the massage.,1,aww
This is so stinking adorable I LOVE yellow labs.  My girl is a scratch addict so if anyone is getting attention she gets jealous.  She tries to push my youngest out of the way when I am getting him dressed.,1,aww
Golden retrievers <3,1,aww
She just wants an ear rub,1,aww
What a good doggy dad! :D,1,aww
Free ear rubs!,1,aww
 Dogs cure allergies.,1,aww
Our dog did this also when I had to put ear drops in our other dog's ear. I guess it made her feel special because she would wiggle her butt and jump around afterward. She's a weird dog though, the only time she wants human food is if we have pumpkin pie.,1,aww
That is the best human.,1,aww
Just like a sibling,1,aww
Meanwhile I have to literally fight my dog just to clean his ears.,1,aww
Dog Dad rocks!,1,aww
This kind of happens with my dogs. My elderly dog is on an arthritis pill and so she gets it in a ball of bread every morning. My other dog will pout if he doesn't get a ball of bread as well.,1,aww
We used to have one dog that needed to be shaved and another dog that shed so no shaving necessary.  Any time we would shave the one dog we would have to lay the clippers on the back of the other one and turn them on so he felt like he was getting shaved too.,1,aww
This makes me happy.,1,aww
"Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.",1,aww

Damn, my dogs run in the other direction,1,aww
Dogs are the best !!,1,aww
I have to use that medicine on my dog too and he hates it. He literally cringes when I pull it out but I think he knows it makes his ears stop itching.,1,aww
The best part is the dog-dad giving that lippy look to the camera, his eyes are just screaming "Make sure you get this part",1,aww
I want an ear massage now.,1,aww
Good boy is just here for the ear rubs.,1,aww
I think the other dog just wants extra ear scritches,1,aww

"That looks good. I'll have what he's having.",1,aww
My dog used to like getting his ear meds, but, I think he liked the ear massage, he was always licking his chops when we'd rub his ears. This is part of the reason I love dogs, they're so cute.,1,aww
Mometamax or posatex? I can tell by the bottle. I still haven't figured out if that's a good thing or not.,1,aww
I wish my dog wanted his ear medicine!  He has to be pinned down.,1,aww
Sooo cute!!,1,aww
That’s just adorable!,1,aww
Roofus you make such a big deal about the ear medicine but I can’t even feel them and it only takes a few seconds. Stop being a big baby.,1,aww

Yo,  I have that same peanuts blanket,1,aww
And a spoonful of ear scratchies.,1,aww
He came for the head scratches,1,aww
The dog version of a hand job.  He wants it whether he needs it or not.,1,aww
Dog say. Haha he fell for it. I just wanted a rub,1,aww
One of my dogs has allergies so I give her a pill in cheese. When I adopted my second dog our cheese bill doubled.,1,aww

What brand is this dog.Edit:breed,8029,aww
Each time I brought home my 3 newborn sons a couple years apart, my big, tough and rough beast of a Rottweiler would sit next to the baby for weeks just standing guard and staring, alerting us with each noise or movement. He was normally very obedient, but when baby toes were in the house, no matter what we did, he could not resist incessantly licking those toes when we weren’t looking. He looked so guilty but couldn’t stop himself. We finally gave up and the babies loved it. He died 4 years ago and I still cry sometimes missing him so much.,13253,aww
I don't know who's tomato this is but it's cute and I want it.,5761,aww
*Just what I always wanted. My own little human! I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him...*,7433,aww
man that is so sweet. dogs get it: tiny, vulnerable, i will be gentle and help you protect it, promise!!!!,4534,aww
Dog got a little stressed out just for not looking at the baby for a quick second. I fear great separation anxiety when this one leaves to elementary school 😂,1528,aww
I think most dogs are super aware of what the deal with human pups is right away. I've read threads before about expecting moms who swear their dogs could tell they were pregnant even before they took a test. I like to think this doggo already knew and was waiting/ excited to see the brand new human.,11898,aww
"Grow up quick hooman....Need someone to throw the ball",2607,aww
She's like "Idk what this thing is but if anybody tried to hurt it, I'd murder them.",1888,aww
We had a husky when my eldest was born. She really loved pears, we gave her one a few days after bringing the baby home and instead of her usual manic devouring of the pear she gently placed it under the basket where my daughter was taking a nap.,273,aww
I wonder what dogs think of the new baby scent.  To them, I imagine it being something like this: Owner 1 scent + Owner 2 scent = New Baby scent?  MUST LOVE NEW BABY IT SMELLS LIKE TWO OWNERS IN ONE!,835,aww
"*MY* baby!",414,aww
I love my dog a lot, he's a pitbull terrier, except I feel like he's too much of an animal to be allowed so close to a baby. I just have trust issues.,819,aww
"this thing is gonna drop *SO MUCH* food for me over the next couple of years...",67,aww
"Human small, I protect.",238,aww
Oh! That is so so so sweet. I  hope my 3 cats fall in love with my lil boy. Find out in 11 weeks!,555,aww

This is the thing to do with dogs.  Don't leave them unsupervised with a baby but make them feel loved and welcomed and that nothing has changed for them except that noisy creature you brought home. I feel that most dogs in a good, happy, safe home are quite happy to allow new members into their family as long as they are not suddenly made to feel like second class citizens in their own homes.  Dogs, I think, need to be treated very much like older siblings when a baby comes home.  Mommy and Daddy still love you very much and you are a good boy :),384,aww
This makes me so happy and sad at the same time.My wife and I had the same moment with our twins and dog, she loved them and was always around for playtime and to be a pillow for them to sleep on, she would give them kisses when they cried and watch over them while they slept.But unfortunately as she aged the vets believe she got severe early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, she began acting erractic and bit both of my twins so bad we had to take them to the hospital and because of this we had to put her down but when I went to see her at the vet after the rabies tests were done on the day we were to put her to sleep she was her normal self, happy to see me and jumping and I help her close is my arms as she licked me one last time and I cried into her as she stuck her tongue out when she fell asleep for the last time.I miss my dog and these moments and I'm sorry if this comment isnt meant for here but I miss her and I just wanted to talk about her one more time and tell people that she was a good girl.Edit to my comment: My apologise for just putting a sad story and not following up with some positivity!Also to follow up, she was in quarantine for 7 days, which I thought meant they were running tests, I guess they removed her brain after she was put to sleep. My apologies for not making that clearer.As for happy, she used to go into my boys rooms at 8 am every day and sniff their feet until they woke up, it got to the point where they started getting up and waiting for her. She would also just follow then around while they scooted around on their little 4 wheel baby scooters and chase them down, when they would stop and turn around she would look at them and then run away and wait for them to chase her.,306,aww
You gonna finish that or...?,12,aww
I’ll be a downer too, but it seems like this dog is a bit anxious. Whale eye, little tongue flicks, all signs of anxiety. That being said, hopefully it’s just that these parents know their dog better than anybody and I’m wrong. :) It took my pup a little while to completely be comfortable with my baby around and we made sure to have only supervised, positive interactions/associations between the two. Two years in, they’re total bros now (and still always supervised).,252,aww
Funny. My parents always told me when I was a wee baby that I could never be left alone with our husky because he would try and drag me around and nibble on me like a chew toy. As soon as I got bigger than him though he seemed to learn his place and we got along famously.,10,aww
Hmm or maybe jealous of baby and just getting as close to possible to the owner.,88,aww
Idk dog looks kind of stressed/nervous - lip lick, whale eye, side glance, ear tuck... Probably going to be downvoted to oblivion because baby + dog how could someone say no?! But here’s a link that has some of the behaviors summed up https://positively.com/dog-training/understanding-dogs/canine-body-language/ I’m not saying baby and dog is world shattering bad btw, just that it’s not as “aww adorable look how happy the doggie is” as we anthropomorphize it to be,100,aww
Pediatrician here. I don't care who your dog is, this is fucking stupid.Source: have seen it multiple times,468,aww
[deleted],39,aww
Aren't you worried the dog will bite the babys face or something? this just seems dangerous to me,129,aww
[reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTaEJMKc7Lw),6,aww
This dog is showing quite a few stress signals here. Doesn't necessarily mean impending doom, but if I was that mother I would be more cautious in the future with letting the dog that close. 1) the ears are pinned back, doesn't necessarily indicate fear, sometimes from excitement. Similiar to tail wagging. 2) lots of lip licking. Appeasement signal to ward off potential threat. 3) the dog makes "whale eyes", they are bulging a bit, then he looks away breaking eye contact. Maybe from a distraction hard to say.That dog is definitely uneasy and nervous. :( not really a good spot to be in for the dog or baby. I'm not saying this dog is a "baby killer" from a 5 second gif. But he doesn't seem comfortable with it. It's a pretty good example of how we tend to personify dogs, and don't realize they have body language that is very different from our own.,55,aww
Never leave a new baby alone with a dog.  Tragedy can and does strike suddenly.,95,aww
Yeah... That's really not what that dogs doing....it's showing anxiety and jealousy. It's trying to get as close to the mom as possible.,198,aww
I am wolf dog. I will eat this tiny human later tonight.,5,aww
she must be hungry,6,aww
Either that or she's just really jealous.,13,aww
I'm all for dogs, babies, and upvotes but there's been instances where dogs attack newborns. This is just one of them. http://abc13.com/police-identify-8-week-old-baby-killed-by-family-dogs/2329045/waiting for the downvotes to roll in,67,aww
Hi, animal-noob here. I was wondering, how do we know one dog is perfectly safe to be so close to a baby (or our face) at a 99.9% probability?,52,aww
I like dogs but I dnt trust them around babies. It's seems like I'm the only one lol.,19,aww
[You shouldn't conduct the experiment using live subjects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvnJmN_yehw),5,aww
Our overactive daschound/jack russel terrier mutt never showed any interest in mini humans...till we brought ours home. The dog would not leave our son alone, had to be a nearby when we were holding him. He would also become very concerned at any squeak or cry that our son made. He would run to the bassinet, check on our son, run to find us, then follow us back to make sure everything was alright.,6,aww
This whole comment section is a great example of how the majority of humans tend to anthropomorphize animals. In reality, animal instincts are very different. It really just looks like the dog is investigating with smell and gauging it's position in the pack with this new member. It's even putting it's head on the baby, like, "okay, so I'm still above the baby in rank.. nobody does anything when I rest on top of it.",34,aww
Humans are terrible at reading dog body language. She’s licking her lips, ears back and wide eyes - she’s anxious and unhappy. The dog shouldn’t be put into this situation as clearly she is unsure how to act; this is not to insinuate she is going to harm the baby in any way - but she’s trying to tell you she’s uncomfortable.,28,aww
Every year some kid dies because an idiot parent thinks their pet is different and would never attack their kid,78,aww
I love dogs,  *love* them, but just please understand that they are still animals and they're unpredictable- my friends 5 month old kid was attacked by their dog last week when it had ZERO previous aggressive behavior and in fact is easily intimidated by their kitten. Totally unprovoked. We all love them. but they're still unpredictable.,23,aww
DANGER DANGER DANGER! That dog is not super relaxed and comfortable and is showing a lot of body language of stress and conflict.,22,aww
Or hungry,19,aww
This is sweet, but people keep forgetting that dogs are animals. One wrong movement, sound or alarm, the dog snaps and the baby is left severely disfigured or worse, regardless of weather or not the dog understands how "precious" it is,88,aww
To join the chorus of semi-negativity, I saw a gif that was on /r/funny titled something like “I think he was jealous,” where a dog owner was patting a stuffed dog in front of his real dog.  The actual dog sat there for a long while looking totally mellow until he just flipped out on the stuffed toy.  People in that thread were saying “Oh yea my dog would be totally jealous,"  yet here I see “It knows its a baby it totally wouldnt harm him.”There’s a few other comments in this thread that mention the dog looks somewhat anxious or is looking to gain the adults affection, and I tend to agree.  Either way, even if I knew the temperament of my own dog, I would still never ever letting it that close to a newborn.,8,aww
My baby cousin has a huge scar on her face from someone doing this with a dog. Cool.,9,aww
He just want to take a bite,3,aww
My male husky knew when I was pregnant. He jumped up on everyone but stopped jumping on me once my belly was noticeable. He was also a loner but couldn’t sleep anywhere except under my babies’ crib. He loved kids and the smaller the better. Very loving breed.,4,aww
Dogs just get it.,4,aww
I feel like a curmudgeon when I say this, but I would never let a dog that close to a newborn like that, dogs got germs like everyone else and who knows if they'd paw at the baby as is their want,24,aww
good boyo swer to protec smol hooman,23,aww
one bite and its all over.,33,aww
Seams pretty dangerous to have dog so close to the head.,187,aww
Eh. As much as I appreciate the moment, it would be very hard for me to let any animal that close for too long. The most loyal of pets make small mistakes and with a newborn, completely not worth the risk. I'd wait until they were much older before introducing them to an animal.,17,aww
'My dog doesn't bite!',12,aww
this makes me anxious,102,aww
Just remember, however adorable they are, never leave the baby and dog alone together,24,aww
Wish dog lifespan was like 100 years.,3,aww
Aww that's so sweet. Dogs are wonderful. <3,3,aww
Dis hooman is gonna get more luv than me?I is ok with it. Just save some luvs for me plz.,3,aww
Everytime I see a dog this close to a little child I get so tense. You might know when a dog won't bite, but just because of an instinct, jealousy or whatever may happen, a bite would totally kill the kid...,11,aww
Looks like the dog is about to take a bite lol,9,aww
That baby’s in danger.,9,aww
Ears back, lip licking, looking away, I don’t think it’s love,6,aww
Is this normal cuz I usually hear story about dogs get jealousy of the new born baby and attack the baby,5,aww
Why would you let a dog that close to a newborn baby?  Risks are high benefits low.,18,aww
That's cute and all but I wouldn't let the dog be so close to the baby's face, tbh.  Animal lover but this made me nervous af. You never know with dogs, they could bite at it for a variety of reasons like one of their toys, etc.,10,aww
This is not doggy love. That is dog asking what the hell is this. Is it food, is it play? Why r u showing over protection, human. This dog doesn't know what the baby is yet in the family's hierarchy.Let the downvotes begin :D,10,aww
Years of being best friends await,16,aww
Never doing that. I love dogs but nope...,6,aww
Are there ever incidents of dogs biting infants as small as this one?,6,aww
This gives me the chills, I feel that the dog could bite the baby any moment.,6,aww
While I understand that people find this sweet... This is r/aww ... I can't help but get worried when I see things like this. No matter how much you'd like to embellish it, it remains that newborns are exceptionally fragile, and dogs are animals, not humans. They are unpredictable. No matter how well trained or good natured, I couldn't ever place my trust in an animal in that kind of way. You only have to glance at a newspaper to see that tragedy *can* strike. Just my opinion.,6,aww
sister in laws husky but my niece in the face. I cringed when I saw OPs post.,7,aww
I would never let a dog this close to a baby.,8,aww
Ive said it before and Ill say it every time i see a post like this.Dogs are animals, its not worth the chance of having a babies face bitten off for the sake of a fuckin "aww" moment. Jesus christ people, stop thinking you know what animals think.,7,aww
It's so sweet how she tries to be as gentle as possible around the baby.,17,aww
I have a serious question. Human touch and any kind of germs around a new baby is super harmful, why do people let dogs around new borns or atleast like why this close? Is it not harmful?,24,aww
My friends dog gives their newborn his toys to play fetch, while he’s sleeping. It’s the cutest thing. He’s gotta wait a few years for his future best bud to grow up first!,4,aww
I'm totally not going to eat it when you walk away,3,aww
That dog is clearly begging for dinner.,5,aww
This is 100% the case with my pittie [Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/UqFfT) and my son.,4,aww
*im just gonna put my nose right here okay*,7,aww
The baby makes me want to downvote, the puppy makes me want to upvote. I guess I'll do nothing then.,8,aww
Seriously wtf did humans do to deserve dogs. I'm totally convinced that if an apocalypse happened the higher beings/religious icons  (what ever you believe in) will save all dogs and leave us.,9,aww
One thing that a lot of people aren't quite addressing is that dogs have played a very important role of keeping watch over human children for a long time. There are even nanny dogs that have specifically been bred for this purpose.,16,aww
Imagine if it just bit right into the baby's skull.,6,aww
Now I want a baby and a dog.,24,aww
I thought it was more of an “Are you gonna eat that” look,24,aww
"Are you gonna eat that?" - Dog, probably.,3,aww
Do dogs know that babies are fragile creatures?,5,aww
Dogs are so strange , mine is huge and could pull a large man off his feet , yet give him a rope toy and a kid and he will only pull enough so that it's fun , he knows just how much pressure to use when playing , the same when walking on a lead,5,aww
'But, but, when do I eat it?',46,aww
Yea.. that's not what's happening here...,9,aww
For the safety of both the baby and your dog, stop doing this.,8,aww
'What can I do to help?',10,aww
My doggo growled at anyone who would touch my wife's pregnant belly. She never growled towards anyone like that before.Dogs know.,9,aww
There's some good comments about dogs knowing and wanting to protect newborns. Also remember dogs can swing the otherway. Huskeys especially have been known to kill many small things and even attack younger children, even though they might seem to be the nicest dog in the world. We can only guess the dynamic that the dog thinks it's in (i.e the owners are the alpha). Not always the case. Just be cautious introducing new things to the pack.Congratulations though. Super cute dog and baby!Edit: typo,13,aww
❤️❤️❤️,12,aww
When she looks at the camera, I'm half convinced she's a porg,2,aww
That’s her baby now. Supervised visits only.,2,aww
Do dogs have an understanding of other species offspring? I just think it's neat how some dogs will protect your children. And other animals will eat them immediately.,2,aww
Millie is such a sweet dodge,2,aww
This human is too small, must observe for further growth Edit: Spelling, for I am dumb human,2,aww
More likely she just wants to smell new tiny human,2,aww
She's high on human!,2,aww
That little munchkin tasted dog breath for the first time. You can see the reaction. They'll make great friends.,2,aww
"got any games?",2,aww
"Welcome to the pack",2,aww
Doggos are too good for us,2,aww
She looks so much like my puppy!,2,aww
It’s an evolutionary trait that babies of any species are cute. It is protection, although it doesn’t always work. I recently watched a documentary where a male lion came and killed a bunch of cubs from a different father. He wanted to mate with the mother so those cubs had to go.,2,aww
We don't deserve dogs ! So precious...,2,aww
I wonder if dogs smell or react to the oxytocin?,2,aww
I thought it was an avocado in the thumbnail,2,aww
Animals are so fucking amazing,2,aww
amazing,2,aww
The baby is like "Hey brah, stop touching  me.",2,aww
Germs though?,2,aww
Really cute baby and I love your pet as well. Both look charming.,2,aww
Aah what a sweet, sweet doggo. I love dogs so much.,2,aww
I rember reading that dogs literraly feel in love with their people. Just big balls of fur and love.,2,aww
They'll be causing trouble together before you know it, congratulations & enjoy!,2,aww
The look of tenderness in that dog is incredible.  And I don't mean it's meat you peckerwoods.,2,aww
WhY hE sO sMoL?,2,aww
I'm in love with this gif.,2,aww
My favorite thing to do with posts like this is sort by controversial and read all the comments that are like **"OMG THE DOG CAN EAT THE BABY"**,2,aww
A life long friendship is made,2,aww
How old is the doggy in this clip? I hope she’s young enough to have some good years left by the time this child is old enough to play with her.,2,aww
What have we done to deserve such magnificent creatures..,2,aww
She’s very maternal towards the little baby,2,aww
Well the mom would’ve been exposed to the dog during pregnancy, so to an extent so would the baby. It’s not like the dog was rolling around in radioactive waste either. Whatever they’re exposed to, so are we as long as it’s our dog.,2,aww
You mean her new tiny human! Super sweet.,2,aww
*I shall protect you for the rest of my life, human*,2,aww
Fairy dogmother,2,aww
At a glance I thought the baby's head was a ballsack.,2,aww
This is the most precious thing I’ve ever seen,2,aww
Kinda a rough day...then this...thank you needed it,2,aww
This is so adorable.,2,aww
The look on her face is beautiful.,2,aww
Gettin in on that new bay bay smell.,2,aww
UH NO, she's concerned she's not gonna get  all of the attention!!!,2,aww
Dogs are special animals,2,aww
Great. Now I want a husky AND a baby.,2,aww
Another reason why dogs are amazing,2,aww
She got that gentle and loving eyes looking at the baby.,2,aww
Oh man that’s so incredibly sweet! I love it 😍,2,aww
my eyes are all misty andni dont knoe ehy brcause i thpught i deleted all my human emotions.,2,aww
Oh my goodness my heart just melted 😭 These two will have a great childhood together,2,aww
That is the cutest!!!!!,2,aww
"Tiny human is mine too? Yeah, tiny human is mine too.",2,aww
adorable,2,aww
Dogs are too fucking pure for this earth. Im not a dog expert but I have to imagine that they know babies are the human equivalent of puppies and have the same reaction.,2,aww
One of the sweetest things ever.,2,aww
This is such a bittersweet memory for me. A few months ago we had to say goodbye to our sweet girl. When she met both of our kids she couldn’t contain her excitement. She adored them both and always was there with them. From the beginning. When I was pregnant she would hover over me and guard my belly. She would also walk me and turn around to circle around and then push me along gently as if to say “come on fatty, puppies aren’t an excuse to be slow on a WALK!”,2,aww
“I will take care of this tiny human for the rest of my life.”,2,aww
I'm a 28 year old guy and I get really emotional when I'm hungover. I need to stay hydrated not cry it all out thanks jackass,2,aww
It has that *"new baby"* smell.,2,aww
Thought the head was a ballsack for a solid 3 seconds,2,aww
This is the definition of "awwww",2,aww
Even dogs love that new-baby smell.,2,aww
"omg he smells like both of you, this is awesome!",2,aww
Or hungry.,2,aww
We do not deserve dogs, but goddamn am I happy we have them,2,aww
“Damnit it still won’t pet me”,2,aww
Oh this is so amazing!,2,aww
Aww,2,aww
Malamutes are the best!,2,aww
She's a good girl..no doubt about it!,2,aww
"We're gonna be the best of friends",2,aww
More like... "This... thing... smells... WEIRD.",2,aww
We have 10 month old dog and a 2 1/2 year old son.  I think it’s amazing the bond they have developed. It’s like she treats him like a puppy trying to herd him when he’s running around and keeps a watch when he’s in the sandbox along with other things I’ve seen in nature shows.,2,aww
Smells like flowers,2,aww
that dog looks hungry,2,aww
This gif is everything,2,aww
i love this a million times.,2,aww
super cute, love dogs so much,2,aww
I am literally dyeing right now...,2,aww
That kid is going to have the best guard doggo,2,aww
This is so beautiful. It made me tear up.,2,aww
Most beautiful thin I’ve seen. This filled my heart with warmth.,2,aww
aww,2,aww
My mom told me that female dog she had when I was born did the same thing, and that she would lay next to my crib constantly like she wanted to protect me. I remember her a little. My two dogs are impressively patient with my niece. My female would sneak behind her little chair when she couldn't yet walk just to touch her with the nose on the back of baby's head. Now when niece is two dog follows her everywhere. Yesterday niece got into cabinet where I keep treats for dogs. I walked in and catched her. She knew she wasn't supposed to open cabinets, so she stood there with a bag of treats and said "gonna give it to Bonia! (My dogs name according to my niece). So she did. I couldn't bring myself to be mad because I was laughing inside. Dog was in heaven tho.Not every dog is great with kids and even when it is we should supervise them because they're animals and kids are kids, but they can go awesome together.,2,aww
Man, considering how nice babies smell to us, to dogs they must have the nicest smell in the world.,2,aww
My heart melted,2,aww
protect mode, enabled.,2,aww
We don’t deserve dogs...,2,aww
That hooman is gonna get many wet noses.,2,aww
He just met his best friend :),2,aww
Cute!,2,aww
Dogs are so gentle,2,aww
'I like dis pink puppy',2,aww
Sweet puppy,2,aww
Clearly enjoying that new bb smell.,2,aww
Dog: "Excuse me, but this is my baby now.",2,aww
This may be the cutest thing I have seen all day.,2,aww
I love the face dogs get around babies,2,aww
What a good girl,2,aww
Are dogs aware that human babies are delicate? She seems to be really gentle with the baby,2,aww
Thank you for making my day a little bit better <3,2,aww
I wonder how much they understand this is a new "pup" in the pack.,2,aww
How PRECIOUS is this!!!!,2,aww
For how long domesticated dogs have lived alongside humans, I'm sure they're probably instinctively aware of what baby humans are like, just as we are aware of them having puppies.,2,aww
I just keep watching this.,2,aww
boy, this is heartbreaking. too bad that puppy must wait so long to play with his new born best friend. :),2,aww
cute,2,aww
She knows...This is splendid,2,aww
And thus a lifelong friendship is born.,2,aww
The animal instinct for newborns kicks in.,2,aww
*aww* so cute . . . 😘,2,aww
She's like: Holy crap it's so small!!!!,2,aww
For those reason sometime I prefer dogs to humans they are just so sweeeeetCongrat for the baby also! :),2,aww
He just loves that new human smell.,2,aww
Oh how I love this,2,aww
That baby is going to love dogs when it grows up,2,aww
This is so precious,2,aww
My husky is way too hyper to do that,2,aww
My six month old mal puppy and my seven year old son are on a path to becoming best friends- I’m not sure they realize they’re not the same species :) Mals are very intelligent, and seven year old boys not so much so I’m pretty sure they’re evenly matched. It’s what I’ve wanted for him since the day he was born- and we couldn’t be happier,6,aww
She wants to eat your baby,11,aww
Ah yes, that new baby smell. Breath it in.,4,aww
Can...can I eat it?,4,aww
My brother was worried about how his crazy, spoiled, not so perfectly trained, formerly pampered princess Fox Terrier would react when my nephew was born.  She loved him from day one and even "guarded" his room.  No jealousy whatsoever even though she got a lot less attention (maybe some relief in retrospect).Use common sense and don't set up any situations that could end badly, but dogs have been with humans for a long time.,4,aww
My Golden, who had previously not shown himself to have even one protective bone in his body, immediately took over as protector when I brought my newborn son home. That night, he positioned himself between me and the door to the nursery, facing the door, as if to say “If you want to get to him, you gotta come through me first.”,5,aww
“Mmm, little potato smells like mom”,3,aww
Dog is looking a wee bit stressed :/,4,aww
Thought the baby's head was a testicle (I'm gross I'm sorry) and had a very misconstrued viewing of this adorable gif,2,aww
Dogs and humans coevolved together. They recognize human emotions and facial expressions. Makes sense they cherish our offspring as well,2,aww
What did humans do to deserve dogs?,3,aww
Dogs are absolutely adorable. I'm glad to be an owner of a rescued doggo :),4,aww
Love it. My wife and I just got home from hospital today with our first child. Our three cats could care less. Looking into cats for dogs exchange programs,4,aww
I expected the dog to lick the baby's face.,2,aww
"The pack grows stronger" - Doggo,6,aww
Man I fucking love dogs! I mean there is no limit to their love, it is truly boundless,6,aww
Congrats on your child, we just had ours last night! No doggo though :/,3,aww
Nothing short of precious! Nothing.,8,aww
Such a cute pair... that baby’s entire head could fit in the dogs mouth lol,5,aww
Doggie knows that babies are eventually food slot machines. Licked faces, licked floors, easy begging... yeah, that pup hit the lottery and knows it.,2,aww
I think that doggy sees a yummy morsel ready to eat.,2,aww
It’s called jealousy......morons,3,aww
Dogs are compassionate and understanding. You are the leader of his/her pack, therefor he/she knows that the baby is a part too. A dog can only be as good as it's master.,3,aww
"I-It's... a hooman pup. Hallo hooman pup.",8,aww
Aww so beautiful, dogs are more protective when it comes on to babies they really understand what's going on smart.,8,aww
Cute, probably fine, but has a small potential for unspeakable horrors. No thank you with my infants.,0,aww
It amazes me how dogs instinctively know how to treat and behave around human babies.,4,aww
Hooman, tiny hooman,4,aww
Keep your big dogs away from babies idiots,7,aww
"Are you gonna eat that?",2,aww
This is the most adorable thing ever.,2,aww
What type of dog is that? It’s beautiful,2,aww
this is the cutest shit ive ever seen,2,aww
When the dog looks at the camera they look so pure,2,aww
Thats a look of jealousy o.o,2,aww
Somehow you know that dog is going to love that little human for the rest of his/her life. What a nice moment to witness! My brovaries are glowing bright!!,2,aww
Dogs truly are man's best friend.,2,aww
"I want to bury this in the backyard.",2,aww
Always amazes me how well so many dogs do around babies and small kids of all kinds.My dog plays rough with larger humans or who he sees as strong enough to play. Yet, he is so gentle with kids and calm. He doesn't jump on, push, lick or run around them. He will stay close, but doesn't lean on them, moves slowly and watches them. He was maybe 5 months old when he started displaying that. Dogs are truly amazing creatures.,2,aww
[deleted],2,aww
The dog looks like it is sad that you only had a litter of one.,2,aww
Wy u so smol?,2,aww
god i love dogs,2,aww
She’s the best girl.,2,aww
Mmmm... Yum. Give it to me since you're not gonna eat it.,2,aww
My parents had a husky when I was born and my parents said that she was insanely protective of me. When I was learning to walk, she would run over and make sure I was ok when I fell down. One time when I was still a baby I was crying and my mom was frustrated because she couldn’t get me to calm down. She shouted at me from another room asking me what I wanted to stop crying. The dog went into my room to protect me and for the next few days wouldn’t let my mom be alone with me in the same room. The dog passed when I was like 3 or 4 and I have a memory or two of her always being near me. I think most dogs have a sixth sense for babies knowing they are essentially helpless and need protection.,2,aww
The cutest thing about this is that the dog would probably protect the baby with his/her life. The dog is completely aware if the fact that it’s a baby, and as it’s a baby in his/her pack, the dog will protect it.,2,aww
"Wen the wurl attac, I protec! Promis!",2,aww
She’s hungry is what she is.,2,aww
“Thank you for giving me this gift, hooman”,2,aww
Classic example of how dogs become family and you can see the look in the face of this dog that even though you had this baby we are going to raise this baby it’s my baby to...❤️,2,aww
I love this dog more than I’ve ever and will ever love another human being,2,aww
So sweet!,2,aww
I haven't commented in a post for years (I don't think), but I have to let you know this clip is AMAZING.  It brings a big smile to my face :),2,aww
Are dogs actually this smart? Do they recognize that this is an infant and you have to be delicate with them?,2,aww
She is protecting her future partner in crime.,2,aww
That is just the sweetest thing. Thanks for sharing. Brightened my day!,2,aww
No she's just hungry that's all,2,aww
Humans did something very right when choosing dogs as our companion species.,2,aww
And my dog just peed on my new L-couch 🙂,2,aww
I remember the day we bought each of our kids home and the immediacy with which the dog connected to them. Each time he was asleep next to their cot or basket right away, and he never left their side for his entire life. I miss my boy.,2,aww
Puppers make the best babysitters. No cash required.,2,aww

So cute. Also having a dog in the household is the best thing you can do for a newborn’s immune system!,2,aww

Dog looks at camera: " OMG it's so cute! I show him Trik. Hay budy, I'll lay my hed her, you lean in n boop the snoot",2,aww

milperthusky on Instagram! Both of their huskies are more needy than this human baby will ever be and I love it.,2,aww
This makes me happy!! I’ve known too many people that have to give up their fur baby when the human joins the family,2,aww
Dogs sense of smell is 40 times greater than ours... imagine how intense that new baby smell is for the lucky pup! It is the greatest smell in the world.,2,aww
IT'S A TINY LITTLE HAIRLESS PUPPER!,3,aww
ITT: dozens of people who own dogs but don't understand even basic psychology...your dog thinks it is part of a 'pack', your newborn smells exactly like both you and your spouse, it smells familiar, it smells like the pack...not just the pack the alphas in the pack so you damn sure love and protect that,2,aww
How healthy/hygenic is this for the baby?,-3,aww
My heart just exploded. This is the sweetest thing.,3,aww
Thats going to be something Special, i can just see itAll that aside._Doggo must hecking P R O T E C C_,1,aww

The dog's name is Millie. The source instagram page this video is from (**milperthusky**) is full of *super* cute videos of her and her brother Rupert.,1,aww
What an interesting pink cub you have here,1,aww
This is too sweet.Our dog still isn't sure of the tiny human, and it's been 3 years! They just politely coexist. The cat, on the other hand, hates our son. Like, to the point where he sighs when the kid walks into the room...and yet, he still lets this child do whatever he wants to him! They'll lay on the floor together, my son smooshes his belly fat, grabs his feet and tail, gives him squeezes, the works, and the cat still puts up with all of it! As soon as there's a chance, though, he escapes to our room to hide from the tiny monster.Now that I'm expecting again, the cat has started snuggling with my belly. Maybe in the hopes that he'll get a more gentle friend this time around...(fat chance, fatso).,1,aww
This makes me wonder: how is it that dogs and cats can sometimes understand if not care greatly for an infant so much?,1,aww
I TOO LIKE TINY HUMANS HA HA HA. error (),1,aww
I wish my dogs loved our baby. They are jealous and scared of her. They move away when she reaches out for them and try to push her over when she is in our laps.,1,aww

I did the same thing with my two dogs, the female embrace her, the male was kinda jealous but now they are all good.,1,aww
I have a feeling that this dog literally finds this baby "cute" in the EXACT way that humans find puppies "cute".,1,aww

I always feel like bull terriers get a bad rap with children because occasionally some nutter who has brought their dog up to be pretty scary leaves them with a child and what everyone else could tell you was going to happen happens. My staffy Maxie was brilliant with children and everything she did was so soft and gentle where as she was really rough when playing with adults, god I miss her :(,1,aww
I just realized that every dog who knows a baby from the start of its life will never really see that human completely grown up.Kinda fucked.,1,aww
I'll just leave [this article](https://news.sky.com/story/woman-mauled-to-death-by-own-dogs-in-grisly-attack-in-us-11175051) here.,1,aww
Oh my gosh.,1,aww
You can just tell that dog is fighting the urge to give the baby face licks.,1,aww
Cats are the same. They love the big, hairless, useless kittens.,1,aww
What kind of species is this? A husky??,1,aww
I wish our dog was like this. She's afraid of our new son, and won't even come within two feet of him. :(,1,aww
That's really cute. Wonder what the husky is thinking.,1,aww

I read somewhere that the Eskimos used to let their Siberian Huskies watch over their little children when they went out to go hunt for food.  I own a Siberian Husky myself and when ever he is around babies he gets real passive, calm but you can tell hes protective.  Its real amazing how traits are on passed on in certain breeds.  Dogs are amazing animals.  pS:  anyone that thinks this dog would harm the baby doesn’t know jack about Siberian Huskies.  They are the most friendliest and gentle breed there is .,1,aww
She looks like one of the last Jedi furrbies. No spoilers.,1,aww

i used to get on at the same bus stop and ride the same bus with her every morning in Seattle. her owner hated all of the publicity she gets but he understood. she would sometimes get on the bus without him paying attention then she would get off at the dog park and he would meet her there. very cool dog,11831,aww
I would ride that bus just so I could sit next to that dog.,3785,aww
That's what Eclipse wants you to think.  She's actually cashing Social Security checks for her owner, who is buried in the backyard.,15471,aww
Wow, it took me at least eighteen years to get my act together as much as this dog right here.,4850,aww
I've seen Eclipse on the D line in Seattle (the route she takes). She got on downtown and hopped off in Queen Anne. I was so excited - it was like seeing a celebrity! But no one else cared so I felt like a dork.Edit: hey, thanks for the gold, fellow bus-riding dog fan! I hope other Metro riders get a chance to see Eclipse on the bus.,25135,aww
Yes!  I ride the D line everyday to work down at Pike Place Market.  I get to see this dog every now and then when the timing is right.  Always cheers me up on those cloudy Seattle days.,1283,aww
AMA Request - owner of this dog.,318,aww
Amazing! How? She can even take a bus home?,946,aww
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass,23885,aww
Good for her. I always feel bad for pets that are stuck at home alone all day while their owners are at work.,2470,aww

but but...who plays with her at the dog park?,115,aww
These are the kind of posts that I see, smile, read a couple comments, go back to the caption and pic, smile again, close reddit out. End on a good note.,205,aww
Let me start by saying this is awesome and I'm glad it happens.But..... How is this legal? I thought most cities have rules against unattended animals and whatnot.,1064,aww
For those who would like to see a little clip of Eclipse :)https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/01/13/black-lab-rides-bus-seattle-washington/21726965/,146,aww
This is the greatest animal story I've ever read if it's true!,250,aww
But who picks up her poop?,276,aww
I live in Seattle and I never see her! I'm clearly riding the wrong buses!!,37,aww
My dog can't figure out how to get out from under a blanket about half the time.  This makes me feel very, very bad about my pooch.,37,aww
This dog takes the bus to the park. Meanwhile my dog chews on his butt until he yells with pain, than continues to do it again and again,31,aww
So cute! I hope nobody tries to take her :(,125,aww
Such a well-behaved doggo! I can imagine her walking around downtown like Belle in the opening scene of Beauty and the Beast. Except people are friendlier and there are more pats and hugs.,120,aww
once upon a time there was light in my life, now there's only love in the park,16,aww

Self walking dogs. What a time to be alive,17,aww
I wouldn't care if my dog knew exactly what he/she was doing and would make it to the park every single day, I would never let my dog do this. One day someone would take him/her guaranteed. The world is a shit place.,40,aww
There was a time in this country that Eclipse would have to sit in the back of the bus.,8,aww
Eclipse is so IntelliJ,8,aww
This is Eclipse. Every day she shucks off her responsibilities at home and goes to the FUCKING dog park all day.,8,aww
Looks like a ruff commute.,35,aww
Just a small town hound . . .Living in a boring town. He took the city bus going any . . .where . . .,16,aww
I want to believe this is all true so bad, but this damn internet is a cruel, cruel place.,14,aww
Props to miles on 99.9kisw for breaking the story.,7,aww
What does she do at the dog park? Do other dogs make the trek and they meet there? Or does she just sit on a bench watching people? lolSurprised History Channel or E haven't done a program on her; "Shining Bright with Eclipse".,8,aww
Video on CNN from a few years ago about Eclipse riding bus[Seattle Public Transit has Gone to Dogs](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/living/dog-rides-bus-to-dog-park/index.html),8,aww
This is Seattle's Lil Sebastian.,6,aww
What happens if an aggressive dog attacks her and no one is around to help with her injuries? At our dog park one stupid man with his Pit Bull kept hurting dogs and he didn't care. I'd hate to see her have to deal with that alone. It seems like the Pit Bull owner enjoys watching his dog attack others, he says 'oh he's just playing, that's how he plays' meanwhile dogs are getting legs ripped and head punctures... it's just not safe. Just like a young child needs their parent or adult supervision, your dog is kind of like a child.,26,aww
I can't help feeling, if her owner intentionally lets her just wander around on her own, then that's not very responsible. That would mean that no one's picking up her poo and she could easily be stolen or injured. Sometimes, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.,28,aww
Seems pretty irresponsible to let your dog go by themselves but whatever...,36,aww
Thank you! I usually completely ignore aww's but this one struck me for some reason.,7,aww
Would love to see the video of a go pro attached to the dog.,6,aww
Multipass,6,aww
 Does she let u sit with her? That dog probably takes no shit from anyone. Like trying to hit on a girl on the bus. That sideways glance then eye roll,5,aww
I caught this post just as I was walking by the dog park she visits!http://i.imgur.com/WZbthBN.jpgThe neighborhood looks after her here :),6,aww
Well maybe she should get a fucking job and buy a car instead of riding the bus^^^/s,6,aww
Would love to see a video of her entering and then arriving at the park and what she does there!,4,aww
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's not a cat.,5,aww

I N D E P E N D E N T G I R L E,4,aww
She is a strong, independent black lab and she will not move to the back of the bus,6,aww
I work at a store downtown that she visits a couple times a week. People are baffled to see a dog walking around without an owner, but she's very well behaved & a joy to have around.,5,aww
This post made me realise how smart dogs are and how stupid mine is,4,aww
Damn, I'm not even that independent,5,aww
She just wants to crack open a cold one with the pups.,14,aww
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that mean? She got her own toys. She got her own bones. Bus pass, never growls she's a good dog.Oh god I hate myself but I had to get it out of my head...,10,aww
So who picks up her shit?,9,aww
A - How could you ever train a dog to do this?B - How is this not a problem in some way? A dog not on a leash, with no human caretaker, getting on  and off public transportation and wandering around a heavily populated urban area and he doesn't get in any kind of trouble? While I find this amazing and adorable, I'm surprised he can get away with this without animal control or something cramping his style.,8,aww
Wholesome aww,5,aww
It might be an incredible coincidence but I'm almost certain that is one of the RapidRide buses in Seattle.,2,aww
If that's true it may be the coolest thing I've literally ever heard about. She takes her own bus pass and goes to the dog park?  There's still hope for us yet if that's true.,3,aww
Is anyone fascinated by whether she gets off the bus of her own volition or if the bus driver does it?,5,aww
Who let the dog out? woof woof woof,5,aww
Shut the fuck up... my dog barely knows how to play fetch,5,aww
No way!,4,aww
wow, and I know people who can't figure out how public transportation works.,4,aww
Lazy owners or overachieving owners, I'm not sure which!,4,aww
The dog on the bus goes, "Bwark, bwark, bwark.",3,aww

You all complain about dogs. I had a damned bird that would sit on my chest and peck at my lips/teeth at dawn. Every day.  Yes, she had a cage. Yes, it was covered. Yes, it was in my room.  Yes I could have shut the cage door.Ever heard a parrot scream?  NOW you know why. The neighbors called 911, thinking murder was happening. After that....well, refer to the first paragraph.,5,aww
I live in Seattle, and more than once my dog has escaped the yard and gotten on the bus that goes to the dog park. Not the bus that we always take to go to the store, but the one we only use to go to the park.Every time, someone gets her off the bus and calls me.I feel like she's heard of Eclipse somehow. Maybe I should get her an orca card...,3,aww
This is awesome. As for the people who are panicked about her being loose, that's how it use to be without people freaking out about every little thing. When growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, my dog would roam the neighborhood and everyone knew her. People would let her come into their homes and let her sleep over for an hour or so. Then Mitzi would trott home and be a happy puppy cause she went on her adventure. Just like humans they want to explore. She passed away at 16. I would never change that for her.,4,aww
This dog is more capable than some people I know.,3,aww
Dogs smarter than me, i can barely get the bus, i get nervous about prices and what to say,9,aww
What? How? That's so coom,15,aww
Debbie Downer here. There are way too many terrible things that could happen to her accidentally or maliciously. I'm not on board with this.,12,aww
She runs around the dog park unsupervised?,5,aww
How does this become a thing? Because I'm a decent guy but I can't imagine a bus driver allowing my dog to ride the bus unattended for even one stop.,6,aww
Look at this [dogspreader](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9eee627188d82fc63fad2c16536a846831bb47d2/c=181-0-1652-1106&r=x483&c=640x480/local/-/media/2015/01/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635567831115685412-AP-US-ODD-Bus-Riding-Dog.1.jpg). Unacceptable,6,aww

Anyway we could see a video of it?,3,aww
Is that true??,3,aww

This is an adorable dog, but I still prefer Netbeans...,3,aww
This stuff makes me believe in reincarnation. Well this and that one Reddit thread about creepy children.,3,aww

How does that dog even know the bus schedule?,3,aww
a neighbour dog used to always get out of his yard when i was younger and would legit break into our backyard and open the gate to get my dog because they were friends, i remember being like 6 blocks over and seeing them just running by together and it caught me off guard. That neighbour dog scared the fuck out of me one time tho i was in the woods on my bike and heard rustling behind me and was 100% convinced it was a cougar till i saw his wagging tail.,3,aww
Eclipse is taking the bus to fuck all the bitches,3,aww
This is quite possibly the smartest dog ever! Hats off to her owner(s,) nice job!!,3,aww
Dogs are not allowed in the dog park.,3,aww

I use to see this guy walk around Portland with his cat just chillin on his shoulder.,3,aww
Does she pick up her own shit?,3,aww
Yeah it's real!  I can see getting on the bus but idk how Eclipse knows which stop is the dog park.  The park is right next to the bus stop.,3,aww
PLEASE PROTECT ECLIPSE AT ALL COST !!!,3,aww
Must be a ruff commute during rush hour.,3,aww
this might be my favorite thing I've ever seen,3,aww
I've been on a bus (D line downtown Seattle) when she got on and it made my day! She's a very sweet dog. She got off at a stop where there's a dog park haha.,3,aww
This is adorable and all but what owner allows their dog to do this?,3,aww
Serious question. What about the poo? Or is eclipse timed out properly to poo back at the owners? Edit: just read the article. Poo is handled by owner that is not far behind.,3,aww
I don't know why, but this seems so sad to me.,3,aww
There's this dog named IntelliJ and she just teleports herself to the dog park.,3,aww
And I can't even get my dog to walk straight on the leash.,3,aww
I saw a dog walking itself on Block Island once. I was having lunch at a restaurant with sidewalk seating, and this big Golden Lab comes by, holding his own leash neatly in his mouth. No humans walking with or near him, and nobody seemed to think this was odd except me.,3,aww
I can just picture the loyalty this dog engenders in the bus drivers. I'm picturing a passenger saying "I'm not sharing a ride with a dog!" and driver just TURNING on them "Fine. Get the fuck off my bus. Go on, get fucked. You're upsetting Eclipse.",3,aww
Brb moving to Seattle,3,aww
I was already amazed by stray dogs in turkey waiting for green lights to cross streets.This is on a whole other level!,3,aww
Doggo haz multipass,3,aww
Someone should attach a gopro to her and record her day. I would so wanna watch that,3,aww
Can you imagine the bus driver like "Ohhhh hey sorry Eclipse, your bus pass is out of credits!" And the dog's just like "Nahhh nahhhh nahhhhhh I ride! I'm going to the park!",3,aww
Greatest thing I have ever seen.  Like lasers...with rock and roll.,3,aww
Who's a good girl!!!!!,3,aww
I feel like at some point someone complained she took up a seat but didn't have a bus pass. Then got a bus pass and everything was ok.,3,aww
Is it normal for a dog to catch a bus in Seattle?,3,aww
The headline here is amazing. I want more details. How was the dog trained to do this? How did the dog learn that "car things kill you" (you don't get trial and error with that one). How does she leave and enter the house? This is amazing and I want the deets.Also, the dog park we go to has a double gate system to avoid dogs escaping when someone is trying to bring their dog out. How does Eclipse enter the dog park there?,3,aww
Let me get this straight, the (very intelligent) dog has to go to the dog park by itself because the owner is too lazy? Seriously?,3,aww
She is like the Moscow metro doggos.,3,aww
I live in Aachen Germany and I have a husky that is nearly all white and looks very wolfy. Everyone in this city knows my dog. I meet people for the first time and I bring up my dog and everyone is like "ohhhh Einstein!" Or I go into a bakery and people already know me because they saw me carrying down the street and while it is cool that everyone treats me super nice and is super friendly because of him I actually get pretty uncomfortable sometimes when I walked through the street and everyone is looking in my (dog's) direction. I don't feel like I can be anonymous, most of the time I don't care but sometimes I would prefer they didn't. So I understand why the owner might not like all the publicity,3,aww
Oh dogs definitely have a sense of time. When I was in the military and only came home on weekends, my mom told me about 10 mins before I came home every Friday he would jump on the couch and wait for me or sit at the door and wait, and this was the only time she said he did this,3,aww
This dog is going places,3,aww
Does this seem irresponsible to anyone else?,3,aww
Who's a good girl?,3,aww
I would have a heart attack if my dog did this,3,aww
They're evolving..,3,aww
Not sure if cool or lazy owner... hmm?,3,aww
tomorrows training lesson: Apply for job as Wal-Mart greeter.  It would make me feel a little more comfortable walking in Wal-Mart then some of the people they have greeting you now.,3,aww
I want to believe.,3,aww
And my neighbors dog just barks and eats his own droppings.,3,aww
I worry now that she will be harmed on her way to or from the park or at the park for 15 minutes of fame.  I hope she is protected.,3,aww
She's a strong, independent black lab!,3,aww
So many questions:Why does she go to the park alone?How does she know which bus to get on?  How does she know which bus to get home?,6,aww
Who picks up her poop?,5,aww
Talk about lazy owners.,6,aww
[deleted],10,aww
This makes me worry.,4,aww
Does she clean up after herself too?,3,aww
Not to be the party pooper, but no matter how cool this might be, it also seems highly irresponsible and disrespectful towards other people. What if something happens to the dog? And what about the people who want nothing to do with an unleashed dog? How are they supposed to know the dog doesn't just snap and turn aggressive all of a sudden? There's a reason why a leash is required by law where I live and it's not just to be mean to dog owners.,5,aww
So who picks up her shit at the park?,5,aww
That seems really fucking irresponsible of the owner.,3,aww
who picks up her poop?,5,aww
This makes me uncomfortable for some reason. I really, really don't like this. Too many crazy ass people in the world to be letting your dog go out on its own.,4,aww
What if something goes awry! I'd be afraid if something went wrong/she got lost/stolen... this is awesome but also scary,4,aww
I'd be too worried that some sicko would harm my baby. Adorable though.,3,aww
The real question is who picks its shit up!?,3,aww
Yeah here's the original post from 2015:http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2saipz/eclipse_dog_takes_bus_to_park_everyday_all_by/?st=J3WGTFHO&sh=3b32aa5d,6,aww
Cute but terrible owners.,14,aww
Holy fucking shit??,2,aww
No one thinks that dog is a alien in disguise Jesus people,2,aww
I'd give up my seat for her.,2,aww
If you need me, I'll be on the bus all day everyday to see this doggo and give pets, lots and lots of pets,2,aww
What a good dog.,2,aww
Just waiting for a Portlander to tell you about "this may be a little weird for Seattle, but it's totally normal in Portland",2,aww
Oh my gawd. I need to go visit Seattle more often!,2,aww
I would love to see a video of his day at the dog park including the 2 bus rides. That would be so wholesome.,2,aww
This is so sweet and amazing!,2,aww
Does she pull the cord?,2,aww
How cute this is has completely shattered my world-view.,2,aww
Does anyone know the genesis of this?,2,aww
I would be scared someone would come up on my amazingly smart bus riding dog!,2,aww
Only if the driver feels like stopping at the right stop. No way is that dog pulling the stop string thing,2,aww
This dog has its life more together than some of the weirdos that live there.,2,aww
Feels very much like something out of a Pinkwater book.,2,aww
Everyday I think, "Nothing could make me want a dog anymore than I already do", and things like this show up.,2,aww
This looks like a Vancouver bus,2,aww
That's adorable,2,aww
This is the dog version of Matilda.,2,aww
Does he return by himself?,2,aww
Seems like it sometimes.  Seattle has the nicest days in the world I've ever had....the 3 days it's nice.,2,aww
Smart Dog and OMG adorable too,2,aww
Dogspreading!!,2,aww
The goodest dog tbh,2,aww
Eclipse, the black doggo of darkness that shall unite Midland. Had she ended any 100 year wars yet?,2,aww
cute i have a yellow canary,2,aww
I can see her just climbing up on someone if there isn't any seats left. So adorable.,2,aww
Is anyone else a little angry? I get fined if my feet touch the seat but a rouge dog gets to ride shotgun.,2,aww
Shit I couldn't teach my ex gf how to do this,2,aww
Does she return home or does the stay there and her family picks her up?,2,aww
This pup can get herself all the way to a park by bus, mine can't figure out he can enter the house when a sheer curtain is in the way.,2,aww
My great grandfather used to have a dog that ran all over town to a female dog when she was on heat, then he was tired when he ran all the way there so he took the bus home. Everyone including the bus driver knew whose dog it was so it was chill.,2,aww
But will she make space for me if its full and the only empty seat was next to her?,2,aww
While you all talk about Seattleans like they are doing a bad thing with not caring, here in my country, this would've never even happened let alone people not reacting to it. The first day a poor doggo tries it, either some maniac with a gun would shoot it or some other maniac would do maniacal stuff to it that I don't want to imagine.,2,aww
Yea, well my dog can sit AND shake.,2,aww
Please give me that dog <3,2,aww
Is she dogspreading?TRIGGERED,2,aww
I bet that Eclipse's tail goes nuts if you make eye contact with her and say "hi.",2,aww
A friend of mine had a Border Collie like this. She knew how to navigate the Bay Area (loooooong ago so I forget if this was Berkeley or SF or what) and if she got bored, she'd often do a lap around the neighborhood to check out all his favorite bars to try and find him. Sometimes we'd just be hanging out and suddenly his dog is at the bar too. There's something really impressive about a dog that adapts so well to society that they understand the public transit system, stop lights and the like.,2,aww
How in the fuck?  I, for sure, couldn't even do this without my phone.,2,aww
Does she pick up her own poop?,2,aww
She looks like my Lily. Lily was put down because the meds couldn't control her seizures.,2,aww
Wow what a smart dog 😀,2,aww
There's an island in Greece called Skiathos and when I was there, each day a dog got on the bus in town and rode it down to the beach,2,aww
Is this trained or just a very smart dog who learned that habits of getting to the dog very park.,2,aww
/r/soposts,2,aww
... My dog still runs into walls by accident,2,aww
I want to hug this dog. I hope she lives forever.,2,aww
What timeline is this?,2,aww
Yeah, but when is Eclipse doing an AMA?,2,aww
All I see is a strong and independent black lab that don't need no man. ;),2,aww
When a Dog has a more involved social life than me.,2,aww
Russian dogs mastered public transportation a long time ago. http://abcnews.go.com/International/Technology/stray-dogs-master-complex-moscow-subway-system/story?id=10145833Eclipse is a Russian spy.,2,aww

She also pays rent every month and goes to the gym 3 times a week,2,aww
Where’s the owner??,2,aww
Good doggo 🐶☺️,2,aww
God bless this dog I hope nobody tries to hurt it!!,2,aww
Does she pull the stop cable at the right moment? Or do the drivers just know to always drop her off at the same spot?,2,aww
After watching a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLVKVPc_Z6k) [clips](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/01/13/black-lab-rides-bus-seattle-washington/21726965/) of Eclipse...she must feel like the man when shes taking that route,2,aww
Is this legal?,2,aww
This is so awesome! Pigeons in London use the underground trains (getting on and off at different stops) but never have tickets, because humans can't pick the offender out of an identity parade...,2,aww
First time we took our labrador by bus, my wife told her to sit as she was buyinh a ticket. When she turned around, our lab was comfortably seated on the seat, next to a guy in a suit. Priceless.,2,aww
And here I know many adult humans who can't seem to do the same,2,aww
Nothing in the rulebook says a dog can't ride the bus.,2,aww
That's incredible. I'd love it if my dog were this independent.,2,aww
Coolest dog ever!,2,aww
My gf made a good point, who picks up after her poop?,2,aww
what a happy doggo and a smarty pants,2,aww
*cough* those are not tears, just, I have some, you know...dust in my eyes <3,2,aww
Oh neat! It's Seattle!,2,aww
[deleted],2,aww
Citizens are not even supposed to be consciously aware of the dog park.  Do not enter the dog park.,2,aww
all i can think of is how the fuck does one teach a dog to be this autonomous. I see dogs walking without a leash i lose my mind, this guy doesnt even need an owner anymore.,2,aww
This reminds me of the stray dogs in russia using the subway system :P,2,aww
Smart doggo,2,aww
Ok it is cute, but isn't the owner worried she might get kidnapped?,2,aww
Dogs are not allowed in the dog park.,2,aww
My first reaction is to feel sad that she goes by herself. Does her owner ever go with her? Of course second reaction is OMFG A DOG IS RIDING THE BUUUUUS,2,aww
I wouldn't let my dog go around by herself like that. It's irresponsible. I'd be afraid of some shitty person abusing her.,2,aww
How large of a town do you live in? I live in Miami and all I can think about is that someone would have stolen that dog the first day it tried public transport.,2,aww
How deplorable. Dogs are becoming too independent these days Smithy, next thing we know they'll want to vote!,2,aww
/u/bexnoodles19,2,aww
Dogs are the most intelligent creatures on the earth next to your mom,2,aww
This dog is going places...,2,aww
You really know your place in the world when you get lost using google maps on your daily commute whilst this handsome fella cruises the public transport network without fuss,2,aww
Before leash laws, many dogs had lives like this.Let them out in the morning, they go out, do their business, visit places, see friends, come back in the evening.I'm glad to see at least one dog gets to still live that life.  Not sure how it's legal...no leash laws in Seattle?,2,aww
r/rarepuppers,2,aww
She Has  A Life More Organised Than Me...,2,aww
She's a good girl!,2,aww
I'm new.  How the fuck does a dog get on and off a bus by itself at a regular schedule?  Are you telling me this is a thing?,2,aww
Meh, my dog has her own car and she drives herself downtown, she can even stop by the market and get me some food on her way back. Her name is IntelliJ.,2,aww
I'm easily impressed but I would completely lose my mind if I saw a dog go through the process of taking public transportation, by itself, to go to the dog park....it would be like the first time one of my kids made their own breakfast without destroying anything.,2,aww
Maybe this will be the start of a doggie movement. #frontofthebus,2,aww
I rly don't want this to be fake news,2,aww
This dog is manspreading,2,aww
Absolutely the most adorable thing I've ever seen. And so nice of the bus company to give her a bus pass.,2,aww
Dumb question here but where is the dog's owner?,2,aww
No i'd totally be excited to see this!,2,aww
My home town (Merrill, Wisconsin) had a dog just like this way back when they had a trolley, who would get on the trolley in the morning and go the west side, and get back on to go back east at night. The high school just painted a huge mural of him on the side of a building. They called him Jack the Trolley Dog.,2,aww
Bullshit,2,aww
Even I don't have a bus pass:(,2,aww
Say what?  This is a thing?  Why do I feel so sad for the dog!?  If my dogs did this I'd be worried sick and feel like a terrible ownerI hope this is fake.  How does the dog know what bus to take and what not too??,2,aww
Seattle looks cool that dog is cool to,2,aww
I want to know how the dog is trained to go solo, I would be so stressed if I put my dog on a bus alone. I have to drag him out of the park, he's not voluntarily leaving that place alone.,2,aww
does dog never scare anyone? I'm a dog owner and love dogs but seeing him unattended make me anxious because of how many people with dog hangups there are.,2,aww
She is so smart🤗🐶,2,aww
News story: https://youtu.be/Bz4XEpK6INU,2,aww
What a beauty! :D,2,aww
Am I the only person worried about who's picking up the dog shit if she's travelling by herself?!,2,aww
My heart can't handle how wholesome this is ;-;,2,aww
Bet this is in Seattle,2,aww
Lol she thinks she's people.,2,aww
How does he know which bus to take?,2,aww
I wonder is she rode back on her own too,2,aww
Wish this dog could talk. Would love to know how it knows.,2,aww
Mom, i can take the bus by myself, u are embarrassing me front of Eclipse.,2,aww
This is the kind of thing I should receive notification for, not stupid jokes.,2,aww
Dog parks are amazing places to head to when you just need a bit of therapy for your soul and and don't own a dog of your own.,2,aww
Here's a news segment that was made about her a few years ago: https://youtu.be/Uh4eR8kZwHI,2,aww
I got to meet another dog like this. He was a self taught scouting dog that worked for the Marine Corps. I met him at the last year of his life, god rest his soul. He use to go on foot patrols with the unit and fend off dogs and local afghans that got to close. Extremely hardworking and honestly If I could I would have a monument made for him at the Battalion I deployed with. To be fair we all didnt want him to be put down but the whole rabies issue was a health concern higher ups couldnt take a chance with. His name was Willy Pete, I have a couple pictures of him on an old hard drive, but here is a photo of some of the guys I worked in the same Battalion with and the legend himself. https://www.strategypage.com/gallery/images/willy-pete-afghanistan-dog-07-2011.jpg,2,aww
How sad :( take your dog to the park or don't own a dog... anything could happen to it with nobody taking care of it.,2,aww
She then walked herself home, ate a pizza and took a nap.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBIX_Y-fT24,2,aww
Does she also bag up and bin her own poops while she's there?,2,aww
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2933  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/70269),2,aww
I'll never understand how Reddit works. This picture and accompanying story is as old as the internet. I think I first saw it when I was on CompuServe. Yet here it is on "the front page of the internet" with 200k ups. ? Maybe I can blow up Reddit with a pic of grumpy cat.,2,aww
Labs are honestly just the best.,2,aww
I wish I knew how to train my dog like this.,2,aww
Would love to sit next to her on the bus,2,aww
Meanwhile most parents won't even let their kids go to the park by themselves... lol.,2,aww
No matter how clever my dog was I just could not trust it walking alone in the streets, idiot drivers, thieves or people trying to feed and pet the dog. Too risky for me but none the less it's amazing that this dog is able to do so.,2,aww
I wonder if the bus drivers of that route think "boy, I hope she gets on my bus today",2,aww
It seems like these really cool stories and occurrences happen everywhere except my city. So everything is like, real, fake or "omg, how?",1,aww
I hope that dog gets special pet discount for a riding a bus with a monthly pass.,2,aww
awwww, this is awesome. be safe, Eclipse!!! what a good dogger.,2,aww
A real life Carl!,2,aww
Htf is that even possible? My puppy gives me a shit eating grin if I tell her to sit or to stop chewing my shoes 😂,2,aww
Look at her face lol she's living the life,2,aww
don't really know why, but this just made my day. Want to pet.,2,aww
The dog is smarter than me,2,aww
Doesn't every city, especially ones big enough for public transportation have leash laws?,2,aww
I'm calling bullshit,2,aww
I wish she had a GoPro on for a day to truly see her adventure,2,aww
But but but who picks up her poop?,2,aww
Hey yesterday was an eclipse,2,aww
goddamn it thats dangerous as fuck, some crazy homeless shitbag is gonna hurt that poor dog.,4,aww
How sweet!! 😄,3,aww
Oh my DOG!,2,aww
This really makes me smile. I wish we had more understanding people and doggos like this.,2,aww
Every now and then I feel like some Reddit posts should be deserving of two upvotes per person. This is one of those occasions.,2,aww
I hope she never gets hurt whilst doing this, what a smart and good dog,3,aww
The alternative headline being about a dog owner that's so lazy the dog has taken to catching the bus alone in order to get some fresh air.,3,aww
You could almost say Eclipse is *IntelliJ*ent.No one? Okay.,2,aww
Lol sort of sad the dog has to take itself to the dog park. Sure it doesn't need its human, but some company is nice.,3,aww
Yes this is remarkable and cute, but I do think it's bad parenting. Yes I can teach my 4 year old to do the same and they'll probably be OK most of the time, but it's not a good idea.,3,aww
Fake,2,aww
Stop starting sentences with "So"... you sound like an idiot.,12,aww
Why would you start your comment with "So"? This is Eclipse etc... is correct.,11,aww
And then there's my dog who's so fucking stupid he can't even learn the sit command,10,aww
OMG I WISH MY TOWN HAD A DOG PLIKE THAT,5,aww
What if God was one of usJust a slob like one of usJust a doggo on the busTrying to make her way home?,2,aww
What a shitty owner to not be able to take the dog to the park.,6,aww
my naem is 'clipsi liek to ridei liek the park my tiem i bideand evry day i ride the busthe many peeple make a fussbecause a sooprize what they seea doggo ride the bus, that me!,2,aww
Making my way downtown, barking fast, woof woof I'm a dog with a buspass,2,aww
Eclipse and the Mystery Soda are some of the only quarks Seattle has left.,2,aww
What a smart dog!,2,aww
The next time I hear about this dog, it'll probably be a post from someone saying that he died. I'm already getting pre-sad to prepare myself.,2,aww
We need to protect her what if she gets stolen :(,2,aww
I don't buy it,2,aww
"Look, a dog that goes to the dog park by itself! Cool!""Look, a ten year old that goes to the park by herself! Call social services!",2,aww
wow its a dog big fuckin deal,2,aww
Is this not illegal?,2,aww
I smell a bamboozle...,2,aww
Somehow I think this would be normal in Japan,2,aww
Why did this title start with "so"?,2,aww
Give it a month and you'll see her on your local news channel.,1,aww
Last time I was with my Corgi in a bus in Seattle, the bus driver told me not to bring my dog to her bus because dogs are not allowed in Metro except for Service animals. I had to quit my job and look for another that is dog friendly and close to home which wasn't really easy.,1,aww
I don't know why, but this made me so incredibly sad. It's like... a dog with no human? I don't  really know why that response, but it's super sad.,1,aww
I downloaded this thread.,1,aww
So wait.. someone actually spends the money to get their dog, their own bus pass?!,1,aww
Ha, this is great. Where I live, if you take your dog on a bus with you, buy a bus pass, carry it in a doggy bag, simply, obide by all the regulations, there is always someone who will give you shit. I love posts like this. It gives me the feeling, hey, there really are nice places/communities/people/etc in the world.Good for you doggo!,1,aww
She must be incredibly smart to know bus routes and timing,1,aww
I know this dog! She quite frequently visits us at RE-PC. She is a very mellow and sweet dog. She comes in looks for scratches from the staff, then finds a spot near the staff room to lay down and wait for her owner to finish shopping.,1,aww
How do you even teach a dog to do this?,1,aww
How do you dm someone,1,aww
We don't deserve dogs,1,aww
That's one lazy owner haha,1,aww
This is adorbs, but I get looks and comments when I let my pups run around without a leash NEXT TO ME... I can't imagine there hasn't been an asshole to report this to the police or animal control,1,aww
P U B L I C     T R A N S P O R T A T I O N     P U P P E R,1,aww
One day she won't find her way back. Could never let my dog do this,1,aww
I'm in Seattle for the summer! I need to find her!!,1,aww
That is fucking adorable, holy shit I want to hug and pet that dog.,1,aww
I wish the owner would put a GoPro on this dog.,1,aww
I would be so nervous letting my dog somewhere by his self. I cant imagine starting a routine like this.,1,aww
That's amazing. I can't even take the bus,1,aww
They are evolving...,1,aww
Just wondering why she had to go by herself? Are her owners disabled?,1,aww
How does she get home?,1,aww
She's such a good dog,1,aww
My poor derpie dog would never be able to do this.  Oh well love her anyway.And whoever said Seattleites are weird, I lived there until 20 and when I go back what strikes me is how grim and unhappy everyone is.  It's marked.,1,aww
KISW's The Men's Room covered this story a couple years ago! Guess the dogs owner occasionally goes with, and on the dogs collar there's even a buss pass!,1,aww
OMG THAT'S THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD OF A DOG DOING,1,aww
Reminds me of when I had no friends as a kid, and would sometimes go to the mini golf place by myself to hang out by myself. Thanks for that, brain.,1,aww
Kind of bums me out that her human can't go with,1,aww
Reminds me of those wild dogs in Russia who take the subway to the city to beg for food.  They even sometimes miss their stops cause they pass out on the way XD,1,aww
I would like to witness that myself. I think it's cool that it has become something natural.,1,aww
So, how the hell did she learn this?,1,aww
I hope this isn't fake,1,aww
That dog is smarter than some of my friends... They can't ride a bus for their lives... End up somewhere in the middle of a field or something,1,aww
The goodest girl,1,aww
Is her human companion unable to go on walks with her? Just curious as to why she is alone, anyone know?,1,aww
On the bus, no one knows you're a dog!,1,aww
A function and productive citizen of this land.,1,aww
every single day?,1,aww
Considering I live in Tacoma near Seattle Ima have to check this out any days eclipse always gets on the bus?,1,aww
So cute ☺️,1,aww
Seattle is a weird place loved it though stayed in bell town. I hope to go back soon but you never know too many places to see.,1,aww
The bus drive  is in on it,1,aww
So how do they get her to go home? I have to drag my dogs away from the dog park or they'd just stay there forever. Lol.,1,aww
Why doesn't she have anyone to go with? :(,1,aww
Where is this?,1,aww
Adorable story, but the dog probably takes a fat dump and nobody's around to clean it up. That's the first thing I thought of as a dog owner... :(,1,aww
It's so funny she has to pay fare.,1,aww
I love dogs so much. I have 2 black labs and I'm trying to find a corgi pup now!,1,aww
Be safe, doggy,1,aww
CUTENESS OVERLOAD,1,aww
One of my neighbors trained her dog to walk itself and he goes on walks every night at 8. It's so cute,1,aww
It can be noticeable but Seattle will be milder than Denver.  You trade the rain for a gorgeous area.  When it's sunny it's so nice here and there is so many things to do outdoors.,1,aww
This is so adorable,1,aww
And she takes multiple stops! And knows where to get off. It's awesome.,1,aww
Wow i can't even get my dog to fetch anything,1,aww
I dont even know her, but I love her.,1,aww
I can't even take my dog on a bus here and yet this dog can get on a bus by itself?,1,aww
I want my dog to do this,1,aww
That Dog has more freedom then I had when I was 13,1,aww
In DC it's illegal to have a pet unattended and not on a leash.  People who are scared of dogs probably were terrified,1,aww
How does one even go about buying a bus pass for a dog? How much do you charge a dog?,1,aww
Smart dog,1,aww
[ABC News article on this awesome doggo!](http://abc13.com/pets/watch-dog-can-ride-bus-without-owner-to-dog-park/472964/),1,aww
This renders the bus unusable for people afraid of animals/dogs I'm a dog person but my mom is one of many who were traumatized by an early experience with a dog. In this case a dog mauled her sister. And to this day I have to stand between her and any dog we encounter that's not on a leash. And leave the area with her.Dogs gotta be leashed on public transit if literally nowhere else. "It's a nice dog" ain't the point,1,aww
Someone should GoPro her adventures!,1,aww
u/shittymorph,1,aww
How do you train a dog to do this?,1,aww
Until you realize the owner took the pic, and it's all an elaborate lie.  This isn't saachan. Don't be fooled.,1,aww
I'm too lazy to scroll through the messages but is the owner up for laziest dog owner of the year or what?,1,aww
dog owners must be lazy fucks. maybe someone should bring the dog home and take it to the park regularly so it wouldn't need to walk itself.,1,aww
Next thing you know they're gonna be taking our jobs.,1,aww
Doesnt this dog belong to anyone?,1,aww
No fucking way this is true,1,aww
This is too good to be true!,1,aww
Next trip to Seattle im meeting Eclipse.,1,aww
I'm done!,1,aww
Thanks, my mistake. Good pupperina.,1,aww
How!?? Just how? Wut!?!,1,aww
Why doesn't her human take her to the dog park? I would be so nervous that someone would hurt her or steal her.,1,aww
Is your name Miles Montgomery?,1,aww
SWEET BABY,1,aww
What time does Eclipse ride the bus?,1,aww
Player with no car = no bitches.,1,aww
What's the back story? I'm curious why the dog goes by itself every day - where are it's humans? I wish they'd let my dog ride the bus.,1,aww
Well behaved than 80 percent of the rest of the bus,1,aww
What a sweet puppy,1,aww
When animals are taking the bus to work, you know we are living in the Last Days :-p,1,aww
Does she have a job to get to?,1,aww
I would like to see humans become chill enough that we can live in harmony with the animals who "get it",1,aww
This is fantastic!,1,aww
We need a video.,1,aww
How does she know when to get off? If she can do it by herself, that's pretty smart.,1,aww
omg,1,aww
I wish I had a dog like that that's amazing that the dog is able to do that itself.,1,aww
I hope she picks up her own poop.,1,aww
This is incredible.  At the same time it's kinda like, the fucks up with the parents?  I'd just be to nervous.,1,aww
I wonder why there are no bus riding dogs in detroit, baltimore or johannesburg,1,aww
People don't try to steal the dog and/or the bus pass??? I wouldn't but where I'm from someone would.,1,aww
Yup dirty to the core like the rest of you baby boomers... lol replied to the wrong thread I have drunken millennial fingers we like to just point the blame any direction,1,aww
love,1,aww
Come on.,1,aww
Haha all the stuff I commented on tonight it would be the cord puller that bothered to respond ..."I ain't no dirty cord puller!"... I won't ever touch public transit if I got pull some cords just to get off...,1,aww
This is actually incredible,1,aww
She doesn't look handicapped or senior to me.,1,aww
Is this real? If so that is too cool,1,aww
Eclipse the dog has a better life then me.   So much freedom so much happiness,1,aww

You know it's two midgets dressed up don't you?,1,aww
Umm...sorry to ask but how does she get home? Only answer I guess....by bus? And she does this all without a watch or cell phone. Amazing.,1,aww
I'm trying to imagine my dog trying to do this, and the chaos that would ensue.,1,aww
Doggos be clever,1,aww
So what does this dog do when it arrives at location?,1,aww
Heh - the bus name in my town is called the 'Eclipse',1,aww
My dog just stares at the wall all day.,1,aww

This is fantastic- unless your allergic haha,1,aww
Sounds more like IntelliJ to me. /r/programmerHumor,1,aww
You going to the park to frend,1,aww
How does she know where to get off?,1,aww
[Ah, the old spy-in-the-dog-suit trick!](http://ilovegetsmart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ep13e.jpg)She's probably leaving dead-drops for the Russkies!,1,aww
How adorable!,1,aww
I'd be such a nervous wreck if my dog was off on her own.,1,aww
Fucker taking up two seats! Bad boy!,1,aww
Sitting big. Adorable, of course she looks like my Ows. :),1,aww
Another reason to live in the city if you have a dog that needs exercise: the bus lines & dog parks.,1,aww
She's so smart,1,aww
does she press the stop button?,1,aww
this is the best thing i've ever seen in my entire life,1,aww
Someone call child services!,1,aww
I dont know the backstory here, but how did this start ? Did the owners push the dog on the bus and said to the bus driver to let her off at some point and everyone just got along ?,1,aww
How does the dog know to take the right number bus back? What if there's delays or the bus gets cancelled for some reason?,1,aww
This is my face when I get on a bus and it's empty.,1,aww
While my dog, retardo the blunder dog can't work out that if he walks under people's feet he'll get stood on.,1,aww
People here are just weird. Really weird...,1,aww
This is fkn insane,1,aww
This is so impressive. I wonder the swries of progression until owners were like "oh our dog is a genius, she can take herself to the park now ",1,aww
Omigod I have the cheaper version!,1,aww
Doggo more civilized than Human smh 😍❤👌👍 good boy :3,1,aww
Aww how cute!,1,aww
Beautiful doggo,1,aww
So, her name is ECLIPSE? Is she named after the worst Java IDE?,1,aww
This is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen,1,aww
Is that the only bus on that route ,if not how dog recognises that particular bus that it has to board 🐕🐕🐕🐕,1,aww
My kind of dog,1,aww
I want this dog. :(,1,aww
What lazy dog owner doesn't take their dog to the park?,1,aww
I N D E P E N D E N T G I R L E,1,aww
What? No? Is this the best Doggo ever?,1,aww
Wow, what an awesome and smart dog. Is the owner not concerned someone will try and take the dog? : /,1,aww
I thought from the thumbnail it was an Fat old woman crouched over hence the nick walking past his apartment window.,1,aww
Is Eclipse a labradore / border collie mix? Aka Bordador?,1,aww
So who picks up her poop?,1,aww
I wonder if things were still pre civil rights if they'd make this dog sit in the back of the bus. I'd bet not,1,aww
Thats cute! They dont allow dogs on the buses here, with or without their human. Lol,1,aww
What a sweetheart.,1,aww
[deleted],1,aww
do dogs pay bus fare?,1,aww
She looks exactly like my fluff, even down to the same color collar!,1,aww
She's smarter than people.,1,aww
What if she takes the wrong Bus?,1,aww
Total Eclipse of the heart,1,aww
Ha ha that's funny,1,aww
I'm not sure what's more surprising, that a dog takes the bus to the park, or that somewhere, pets are allowed on buses.,1,aww
She has her own FB page and loads of pics getting pets along her route, all with a big smile on her face. She clearly lives for this.,1,aww
Why do so many top posts on r/aww claim the animal does whatever thing "everyday/all the time/only" when it's blatantly obvious the animal doesn't do it often ?So strange to me.,1,aww
I'm so curious to know how she learned to do this. Most of the time I feel like I have to go somewhere with no one around to even let my dog off the leash, let alone her wandering by herself,1,aww
The City Council announces the opening of a new Dog Park at the corner of Earl and Somerset, near the Ralph’s. They would like to remind everyone that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. People are not allowed in the Dog Park. It is possible you will see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park. Do not approach them. Do not approach the Dog Park. The fence is electrified and highly dangerous. Try not to look at the Dog Park, and especially do not look for any period of time at the Hooded Figures. The Dog Park will not harm you.,1,aww
This is it, this is the future. A world where animals and humans get along in harmony and animals are even able to use public transportation by themselves, and go to the store to buy doggie treats... or starbucks,1,aww
If I ever got to Seattle, I will ride this bus until I see this dog.,1,aww
Why does this post start with the word "So"?,1,aww
This is absolutely amazing! I'm in love,1,aww
Literally more independent than me.,1,aww
I thought dogs like to walk.,1,aww
How does the dog get back into her home?,1,aww
Meanwhile I get lost taking a simple bus stop,1,aww
Does she clean up her own poop at the dog park too?,1,aww
Cool stuff, I only just thought about it but just like people animals can differ in that some are born or develop parts of the brain that have a higher capacity of learning.,1,aww
without a doubt the coolest dog on earth!,1,aww
Meanwhile I still cant navigate the MBTA red and orange lines after 27 years..,1,aww
Sorry to ruin everyone's fun but what type of dog is that,1,aww
They could have used drones to carry ropes up to people they could have tied off in their apartments and scaled down!,1,aww

"I don't like OP" and "I don't like pit bulls" are not reasons to report a post. Please stop.,1,aww
It's the opposite with my dog. She has epilepsy and suffers fits sometimes. It can be very scary seeing someone you love have an episode so we just try and protect her, make sure she doesn't hurt herself until she's lucid again. Then afterwards she gets lots of hugs.,3662,aww
My cat sits by me and alerts my partner when I have a seizure. I know it's not as cool but I am proud of him.,277,aww
Extra good boy,3706,aww
Dog: "This is fine.  Everything is fine.  Seriously, I've got you."  :),2820,aww
Hmm, can the dog understand just how critical the situation is or does he think he is just being trained in advanced cuddling? Regardless, I'm sure he knows he's getting some treats out of this.,13450,aww
Saw this was posted yesterday on /r/videos (based on post title) but didn't click because I didn't feel like watching a video at the time.I literally said to myself, "I'll just wait til /u/GallowBoob turns it into a gif."And here we are...,2544,aww
This is also my dog when I try to do pushups. She's also a good girl.,252,aww
What did we do to deserve dogs?,10106,aww
Not all heroes wear capes.,845,aww
> This is how Colt is trained to block my head during a seizure, because I have a TBI it is very dangerous for me to hit my head, I can literally die if I hit my head really bad again. This is only a reenactment, this is NOT a real seizure. And no of course I'm not really hitting my head in this video. This is just us keeping up with his training, I have to test him on everything that he knows often to make sure he still does it all reliably. He is trained to do this in a certain way that keeps both him and me safe, he will not get hurting doing this the way he has been trained to. I'm not actually there during a seizure so I would not be able to know if he did his job right or not. The middle video is basically a blooper, I laughed so hard, the floor was super slippery and he had a hard time getting his body under my 10lb head. The important thing that makes me super proud is that he never stops trying. He always looks back to make sure I am safe and keeps trying till I am. I am so blessed to have him. He has saved my life in many ways. [Source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZskqSLnMDRQ&feature=youtu.be),4158,aww
GREAT BOY STATUS UNLOCKED.,297,aww
"You call it training, I call it snuggles" -Dog probably,37,aww
"I'm helping because I love you",235,aww
That is one really good dog. He's all like "OK Momma we play the game where I force you to use me as a pillow, yeah I know momma im a lumpy pillow but beatin your head on me won't fix it",94,aww
I was always taught to not touch the person when they're having a seizure and to just clear everything from around them. Would the dog pushing his body under her head like that not be a risk?    If not, this is adorable as it is amazing. I'm not trying to be the devil's advocate here. Just wanna know some stuff about things, ya know?,147,aww
This is so badass. Just to be clear though, that woman is faking a seizure right now for the sake of the training right? I've never actually seen anyone have a seizure so I couldn't say what it looks like,89,aww
My mom has epilepsy and is moderately functioning. How can we get her a good boy like this one?,15,aww
Throwaway to say that dogs are amazing and their pureness makes me cry. When I was a teenager, I had a self harm problem. I'm currently 3 years free. What made me stop? We got my dog 3 years ago. She caught me self harming ONCE and started barking up a storm and jumped up on me, trying to knock the scissors out of my hands. Still makes me cry to this day. Love you, Marlee <3,15,aww
Perfect, sweet boy.,27,aww
That's a good boy.,39,aww
And now I'm crying.,133,aww
The girl in the video says the dog is a weimaraner and labrador mix. It does not say anywhere that it is a pitbull?,52,aww
I tried this with my cat. He sat on my head.,8,aww
I have one of these animals. Sure, they have the potential to be aggressive and violent - but that's just like any other animal or person that you teach and mentor. These animals have all the same ability to love and be sweet. It's all about who the owner is, what environments they are exposed to, and how you treat them.I adopted a pitbull that was 5 days away from being put down just because she was a pitbull who was found on the street with no known history. She's the best fucking thing to happen to my life. I was in severe depression with no feeling of purpose and she put light back into my life. Edit - this comment won't be at the top and that's fine, but for those who do see this don't buy into the stereotypes. This video provides visual proof of how loving and emotionally aware these animals are.I wish I could take them all home.,67,aww
For those that don't know, the owner already suffers from a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), so if she ever hits her head hard enough, she could die. The dog is literally saving her life when she does have seizures.,23,aww
OP said it was a weimaraner/lab mix. Not a pit.,12,aww
Dogs are amazing!,6,aww
Not a pit bull folks.,6,aww
Nothing brings a dog more happiness than a purpose or a way to contribute. It reminds me of the 9/11 search and rescue dogs. They were so determined to find living people, that they got depressed. Search and rescuers had to bury themselves in rubble so the dogs could find a living person.,5,aww
"It's okay mom I lie here now.",6,aww
Fuck those pitbull bans. Ban bad owners,325,aww
The goodest boy!!,21,aww
Dogs sense of smell is so acute they can smell cancer. Penn Vet Working Dog Clinic is working with dogs to do this.,5,aww
I had a Pitt Bull named Tyson that ended up becoming my brother's dog. My brother has some issues, and Tyson seemed to always calm him down. It's almost as if Tyson knew what to do. He's been registered as a service dog now, and is still happily taking care of my brother.,16,aww
Let's be real, OP doesn't repost, he "crossposts" but if reposting wasn't so looked down upon he would do it in a heartbeat. Makes money from it either way, though.,3,aww
That neck game.,6,aww
If you saw the youtube video, the owner clearly says the dog was hand picked from the litter by herself and a behavioralist.https://youtu.be/ZskqSLnMDRQI'm much more inclined to believe the owner over a redditor.,4,aww
I didn't think I could love dogs more, but I was wrong.,6,aww
This is what a dog does. A cat, on the other hand, would back up to her so her face was bouncing on its ass, because cats are fucking jerks.,4,aww
I see in his eyes that he understands this is serious. Dogs are too good for us.,4,aww
This is not a pit bull, this is Colt the Service Dog, he is a Weimaraner/Lab, look up their YouTube channel!,4,aww
I have a cat that will calm me down. I get super stressed and have panic attacks. A dr said I probably have PTSD because of my past. But my cat wasn't even trained to do this. She was on discount at a local pet store that sold animals for the humane society. I didnt even want a cat at the time but felt a connection with her and her roommate. I also didn't want them to die bc that is where they were headed.Every time I'm upset or angry she comes and cuddles me. The more pissed off i get the harder she cuddles me. She sleeps on me every night. Sets me know when to calm down and it makes me a better person.Animals rock.,4,aww
I teared up watching, as a wee lad my dog was my best m8 and no matter how horrible shit got in my house or outside,he was always there to comfort me. I wish i could tell him how much i loved him and still do.,4,aww
God he's the best boy, doing a great job 👍🏼,4,aww
I don't know why, but I always thought dogs would attack people having seizures. No logic to it, but I just thought they would.,5,aww
WE ARE NOT WORTHY,5,aww
Please cross post this in r/epilepsy!  I think some of us would find it interesting,5,aww

"That looks like it hurts... Here use my head instead",3,aww
I should show this to the people who I work with who get mad whenever a non-blind person walks in with a service dog...,3,aww
"The lengths I go to for a little petting..."Joking aside, dogs are awesome, especially service dogs.,3,aww
He should've put a wallet in her mouth.,3,aww
*Oh my gosh this is so cool! OP must be someone who works with service dogs I'd love to ask them about it!* **sees username***nevermind.*,3,aww
This is not the dogs owner. She is not having a seizure. This is a woman training a service dog. OP took someone's video that was on my front page earlier today and made it into a GIF.,3,aww
I don't like pit bulls not reasons to report a post,3,aww
Good boy, just don't get your ear caught in her mouth or you'll have a bad time.,3,aww
I had to do that when my dachshund had seizures. Guess that makes me a service human. But seriously I'd do it all over again. I miss that dog!,3,aww
His eyes were saying "I hope mama is okay.." We don't deserve dogs. What a good boy!,3,aww
For those talking sh** and not taking it serious, 1 glorious day you would wish you had a magnificent animal like this watching out for you.  People suck, so dont expect bystanders to help. #natureisfukinglit andhumansarenotworthy,3,aww
Nicest dog I ever knew was a Staffy bull  bitch called Maxie, I didnt own her she was a part of the family, she died a few years ago age 15, she would have gone to the grave to help a human, most loving animal I've ever known, was brilliant with children never so much as showed her teeth never mind bit one, I honestly put her on a higher level than half the humans on this planet x RIP maxie,3,aww
How is this not a dog of the pit bull category? The big dopey head, the streamlined ears when active, and the muscular physique. Looks like a staffy, which is counted among pit breeds,3,aww
Fuck yeah dog! You go dog! I hope she's alright though,3,aww
I know what to do, I'm a good dog.,3,aww
How awesome that a dog is trained to absorb the blows and weight of a human head during a traumatic seizure. And not moving . Waiting for his master to be okay . What little troopers we have,3,aww
Dogs, dude. Dogs.,3,aww
Just another reason why man kind does not deserve dogs.,3,aww
This is either a pit bull mix or another bully-breed mix if not a pit bull. regardless of breed this love and trust between dog an owner gave me the happy sniffly tears,3,aww
The definition of training a service dog!,3,aww
We don't deserve dogs!,3,aww
We don't deserve dogs,3,aww
And people say pitbulls are bad doggos,3,aww
Its about time pit bulls were recognized for their many uses. Did you know pit bulls were bred as nanny dogs, to help watch small children? The more you know,3,aww
That made me cry. I <3 pit bulls,3,aww
What a beautifully trained service dog!,3,aww
Pit bulls are a beautiful breed. It clearly shows it is not the breed that is dangerous, but the humans.,3,aww
This was beautiful. To see dogs do such important things for their humans is so touching.,3,aww
Such a good doggo.,3,aww
I've never seen anything like this.  It's so amazing what dogs can do.  We're so lucky.,3,aww
People who are shaming pitbulls are fucking stupid. Those dogs are the most loving breeds you can get, it's the owners responsibility to train their dog correctly. I've had two pits in my life, one when I was around 6 and another at 19. Both of them had/have zero problems in public, loved children and other dogs. Their loyal, protective and loving.,3,aww
Pitbulls are great but according to the source video this is actually a Weimaraner/English Labrador mix. (The poster says so in the FAQ),6,aww
We don't deserve dogs. We probably never will.,6,aww
Meanwhile a cat would be like.... "Ugh human?... Human? Feed me now!,10,aww
Had a customer have a seizure when I was working at Home Depot; it hit her as she was sitting down on a low pallet of tile. She had her service dog in training with her, and as soon as we got the woman to the ground, her dog crawled under her right shoulder, prying upward. The pup got the customer on her side in record time. No hesitation. The best pup in the house. The service dog stayed there while I kept the seizing woman's head from knocking the ground until paramedics arrived. He/she may have been in training, but that lil doggo sure did their duty.,5,aww

Give him all the medals,2,aww
Animals are sensitive to changes in people's emotional state.  Has anyone ever watched **The Dog Whisperer**?  Cesar Millan has spent his life trying to understand how dogs can sense changes in an owner's physical condition and emotional state.  Service animals are legally allowed to accompany owners under many circumstances:      https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet,2,aww

How the fack did they train him to do that so carefully. My dog is two I think she finally has "shake"...and now she kinda just throws her paw at me whenever she wants attention, sometimes scratching my face,2,aww
I love dogs so much fuck this was the best thing I've seen all week,2,aww

Try that with a cat... (rolls eyes),2,aww
He's not a Pit. He's a weimeraner/lab.,2,aww
I would give this dog a medal for saving his owner....,2,aww
I recently had some seizures and they took a big toll on my body. I scratched up my face, bit open my lip real bad, bruised both my arms, and even loosened some of my teeth. Seeing a dog protect their owner like that makes me want to get a service dog asap.,2,aww
I'm suspicious that the dog isn't just looking for opportunistic patting.,2,aww
This is too adorable!!,2,aww
Damn I love dogs.  :'),2,aww
ask not what your doggo can do for you—ask what you can do for your doggo.,2,aww
Just here to say I wish my friend had this dog. He suffered from epilepsy...and died due to a massive head trauma. I would say that I'm extremely thankful to the people that train these animals to look after us humans. But part of me thinks that all animals look out for all living things...then I subscribed to r/natureisfuckingmetal and that removed that thought...but I never see a dog on there.Dogs are awesome,2,aww
Makes me think how my Sam acted when he saw me have a seizure. He sort of stared at me when I opened my eyes and then when he detected my consciousness he wagged and dived on me but I wonder what his thoughts were when he had to watch me All by himself, makes me sad, I miss him,2,aww
Mans best friend at work again. 🤘🏼really cool,2,aww
Why does it say Not a Pitbull? Is it not?,2,aww

My pit Hershey just passed away last Saturday. I've been very depressed and probably will be for a while now. Seeing this video has really given me a happy. Pitbulls are the best breed out there, hands down.,2,aww
She has epilepsy and seeing a dog like this watching out for you.,2,aww
That sweet look and the lick of the chops she gives when she knows she's done her job 😇good girl. (Just seems like a girl to me),2,aww

Relatively Irrelevant Question: How did they capture this footage? Is there just a camera on the ground to capture this part of the room?,2,aww
I had a seizure at home sat on the sofa when I was home alone with my dog, I came round to him sat next to me with his head on my shoulder and his paw on my chest like he was checking I was okay. It seemed extra cute because he’s not allowed on the sofa usually,2,aww
Such a good boy :),2,aww
Very good boy !,2,aww
The look on the pups face makes me tear up a bit ehh,2,aww

Good dog. Pits are so precious, I'm sure this little one will make an excellent service dog.,3,aww
Idk even though it says not a Pitbull... Looks a lot like the one I had. Anyone that thinks they are predisposed to violence is just ignorant. Any breed can be trained to attack.  Two corgis attacked my Doberman/Rottweiler and he didn't retaliate.  He sat down and cried and had a slit ear from it.,4,aww
There is no doubt in my mind that if I was having a seizure, my pit bull would step on me. She has absolutely zero self awareness. She's the best though and I love her. Such a good dog.,2,aww
belly rubs with the head?weird, but OK.wag wag,4,aww
No bad dogs. Only bad owners/trainers.,5,aww
Someone please tell me what the fuck did we do to deserve dogs. What a beautiful, wholesome creature...,4,aww
Pitbulls are such blessings.,1,aww
Pitbulls rock. I miss my pit girl.,3,aww
To whoever say pitbulls are aggressive, then you are wrong humans are the aggressive one that instigate they nature in such beautiful companions 😢,3,aww
Pits get such a bad reputation. They are truly amazing dogs,3,aww
That just melted my heart, I love dogs so much, pit-bulls are my favourite, so loving,3,aww
pit bulls are the most loyal, protective, no nonsense dogs if treated and raised with respect.  best dog i have ever had.,2,aww
A pit bull bite me a few weeks ago ( I'm a mailman ) can't ever be mad at such sweet dogs for protecting their homes. Also this is cute as hell,3,aww
THE GOODEST BOY. 😭,3,aww
I never thought I would enjoy having a cat as a pet but since living with my girlfriend who has a cat, I have learned that they can be very compassionate and a joy to be around. With that said, Chum (our cat) would never "stick his neck out" to protect me. This is why dogs will always be number one.,5,aww
"We tried to teach a cat the same thing with an epileptic, but instead of helping the cat would go and turn on the strobe light",5,aww
I swear man. Pitties are about the most beautiful dogs ever. To my mind they truly are the most perfect breed of dog.,13,aww
Pits are great dogs.  Too bad they get a bad rap from shitty owners.  While they are bred and trained to be killing machines, the ones that are trained to be kind make awesome pets.  R.I.P. Caesar, you misbehaving little shit.  You were still loads of fun.,8,aww
Not that it matters but that's not a pitbull.  From the Youtube video, the owner says the dog is a Weimeraner/English Lab mix.,2,aww
If you don't like pit bulls, I don't like you.,5,aww
Wow. This is incredible. As someone who has seizures this hits close to home. Pit bulls rule!!!,3,aww
There is such a terrible stigma around pits. They are incredibly warm and caring when raised with love. I love seeing examples that show the counter-narrative.,3,aww
That's so awesome. How wonderful that woman and others suffering with seizures have a friend to help them prevent further injury.,4,aww
I love pitties even more 💓,3,aww
I just burst into tears,4,aww
Good dog. Very good dog.,2,aww
Aww, big scary pibble 💙💙,2,aww
I was told in medical class not to hold their head. Don't do anything except clear the area of dangerous objects. But hell idk.,2,aww
we humans don't deserve these wonderful, joy and love filled beings,,2,aww
testtest,2,aww
Why did this make me cry,2,aww
This is Fucking outstanding........,2,aww
I just hugged my pittie so hard.  Love this.,2,aww
We don't deserve dogs.,2,aww
*let the bodies hit the....floooooor*,2,aww
This is not a good doggo. This is the best doggo.,2,aww
I'm not crying. You're crying.,2,aww
You're fuckin with my feels, Reddit. We seriously don't deserve good family members (I mean dogs),2,aww
We 100% do not deserve dogs.,2,aww
I can't think of a reason for a camera to be pointed from that direction in a real life situation. I'm guessing this was staged.  Unless... oh my god the Roombas are watching us!,2,aww
Literally front page yesterday.,3,aww
My pit tries to do this and I don't even have seizures. Good doggo.,0,aww
He protecHe attacBut most importantlyHe protec his owners head by laying it on his bac,3,aww
And people say pit bulls are bad breeds. It just goes to show that it's not the animal but what you make the animal that counts, as this pit bull is clearly intelligent and compassionate enough to do its job and prevent injury, as opposed to causing injury which they're constantly slated for.,3,aww
Most remarkable thing I've seen in a while. Pit bulls are so lovable and so caring for there owners! She chose a great service dog!,2,aww
We literally don't deserve dogs <3,-1,aww
My dogs both do this without any training...they have different intentions, though. PAY ATTENTION TO US.,1,aww
This is so amazing, it makes me tear up.,1,aww
Wow, that's amazing.,1,aww
What a good doggy,1,aww
That is a very good dog.,1,aww
Wow! Such a good boy!,1,aww
I know I'm projecting, but seeing the look in the dogs eyes, it was afraid but so willing to protect her. I'm totally crying.,1,aww
I want a dog,1,aww
If my dog does this already (tried it out to see what he would do) does it mean he has potential to be a service animal?,1,aww
If I had seizures like that, I wouldn't have laminate flooring.,1,aww
Wow its just amazing how much animals care about us... it almost makes me cry. As someone who suffers from depression, i want a dog really bad,1,aww
What a good boy (or girl).,1,aww
Beautiful dog, but you're wrong about the breed - Colt is a lab/weimaraner (but just as good of a dog nonetheless),1,aww
Wow, that's amazing. Smart creatures they are!,1,aww
reverse gif gets me everytime,1,aww
well trained,1,aww
Truly mankind's best friend.,1,aww
Omg❤️❤️❤️I love how he's like " it's okay! I'll protect you friend :)",1,aww
And here I am and I can't even get my dog to stop pissing in the house.,1,aww
Im just gonna type some stuff and say good boy,1,aww
Good dog!,1,aww
I love him so much.,1,aww
I swear to god I saw this exact gif in the morning.,1,aww
He knows exactly who's a good boy.,1,aww
Absolutely amazing! Give that dog all the snacks.,1,aww
Omg ! Cool,1,aww
I cried watching this.,1,aww
Who's a good boy???,1,aww
Looks like Cosby was here.,1,aww
Wow the human race truly don't deserve such amazing animals.,1,aww
Good dog.,1,aww
Good boy :),1,aww
No, you are crying.,1,aww
Yeah, humans are not worthy of dogs. They are far too good to us.,1,aww
Dogs Are The Best!,1,aww
Can't figure out if this is cute or amazing so i'll just leave it at both.,1,aww
[**Here's the original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/comments/6sab96/service_pitbull_training_to_protect_mamas_head/) YouTube video from last night via r/AnimalsBeingBros for anyone interested,1,aww
can we do this with elected representatives?to the post itself - this is certainly uplifting, not sure if aww, if it weren't galloboob i'd upvote it for sure,1,aww
I wouldn't be able to stop from laughing if I was the person training the dog to crawl under my face. My dog does this already if he can't see my face and i'm laying down.,1,aww
Good boy,1,aww
Why was this being recorded,1,aww
Heartwarming stuff man. I fucking love my Staff.,1,aww
Dogs are the best.,1,aww
How the hell do you train a dog to do that?,1,aww
This makes me emotional... thanks.,1,aww
good pup!,1,aww

Today at work i saw a service dog alert its owner that her blood sugar was getting low. It was amazing.,1,aww
[deleted],1,aww
My eyes started tearing up:( that's so sweet and loving. I know that dog was trained but regardless that's so casting of him or her.,1,aww
Fuck me. I love that dog,1,aww
Well that's certainly something the NHS never offered me,1,aww
That's amazing! What a good dog!,1,aww
Was just now listening to a song posted yesterday, [Prismo - Hold On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU8OwUx_w3c) and it was just saying the lyric: "And I said Hey oh just let it go your struggles won't remain And I said Hey oh we're holding hope in wake of yesterdaySo hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on, hold on to me!"Right as the doggo snuggled his way under her. Bam waterworks all over the place. I'm a grown man, but damn that was amazing timing.,1,aww
that sweet face!,1,aww
Here. Bump on me instead. I'm softer. <3,1,aww
There's quite a list of things that could not be done without trained dogs, come to think of it.,1,aww
I have had epilepsy for like 12 years and never considered I could be eligible for something line that. Cool!,1,aww
"I am pillow doge!",1,aww
When I had seizures, my dog would just sit on me lol,1,aww
Couldn't that really hurt the dog if the seizure is violent enough?,1,aww
Why is this post making me cry?,1,aww
I remember laying down behind my old flatmate to stop him against the wall when he was having a seizure. Had some nasty bruises after that, a 15 stone guy can sure throw some power about when his brain decides to go nuclear.Is this physically safe for the dog?,1,aww
Guud doggo,1,aww
Goodboye Givin a soft,1,aww
What a cute pupper. I have a small jack-chi that does this exact same thing, except he does it for attention, not to save me from anything... well maybe boredom.,1,aww
This is literally one of the most adorable and sweetest things I've ever seen.,1,aww
I freaking love dogs,1,aww
DOGGO to the rescue.,1,aww
I spoke to a gentleman at the grocery store today with a service dog. His dog was trained to position itself to catch the man when he would stumble due to a balance issue. Animals are amazing!,1,aww
G O O D B O Y E,1,aww
¡DALE!,1,aww
is this staged?this looks staged,1,aww
This is why animals are better than most humans,1,aww
Dogs > cats all day every day.,1,aww
Super cool. Could you also get carpet instead of hardwood to help mitigate any possible head trauma?,1,aww
Seizure/epilepsy service animals are trained to either detect the change in chemicals or pick up on characteristics in their handlers to respond accordingly. Some of these animals will never respond to a chemical change but will know that a certain action dictates them to perform a task aka protecting her head when the dog sees her hitting it. It can be no different than teaching a dog to speak on command.,1,aww
Cute,1,aww
Who's recording this? Shouldn't they be helping?,1,aww
So who filmed this while she was head banging,1,aww
Expected more chomp.,1,aww
That's just beautiful,1,aww
Only been 12 hours since this was last on top of /all.,1,aww
I had to watch it about ten times to realise whether that thing having a "seizure" on the floor was a human or not. Am I the only one...?,1,aww
Awww good dog.,1,aww
Good do...no, OUTSTANDING dog!,1,aww
I need to teach my dog to do this for my Wife. Thankfully her Grand Mal are rare, but she's suffered so many concussions in the past year or so.,1,aww
Reason why dogs are called man's best friend!,1,aww
Falling and head injuries FROM falling are **so much more** terrifying than I realized before my little sister developed epilepsy, which is apparently pretty common in cognitively impaired kids. She didn't start having seizures until she was 16 and the first was in such a spectacularly bloody fashion that over 5 years later I'm STILL dealing with the fallout from the PTSD I developed (I've always had low-key anxiety, this spiked it into an entirely new level of "anything-and-everything can kill you")... let alone what my mom and sister have to live with.They have it mostly under control now and she doesn't have the grand mal seizures anymore but she'll still seize long enough to fall and then space out for a while. Poor kid's torn her ACL, had 2 black eyes, a broken nose, a bruised rib, more split lips than I can count, and she suction-cupped the small of her back to the side of the tub which turned her entire lower back green and purple, all in the last 3-4 months. I would LOVE for her to get a seizure dog.,1,aww
I am continually amazed that we can train dogs for this sort of thing. I understand the mechanics of how they are able to sense these things, but the fact that they know to do something appropriate about it is really amazing.,1,aww
That's amazing!,1,aww
That is beautiful. What a good boy.,1,aww
TIL my dog is trained to protect my head in case I ever have a seizure, cuz she does this shit without prompting.,1,aww
What if they get smothered ?,1,aww
He's a good boy.,1,aww
"The camera slowly pans to the left revealing the shadowed figure of a cat slowly licking it's paw. He glances up to see what is causing the annoying noise that has distracted him from his important cleaning process. After realizing it's just the stupid dog heroically saving the stupid human without concern for its own body as it places itself between the floor and the stupid human's head. He watches for a few moments hoping the stupid dog would fail in its desperate attempt to keep the stupid human safe. He decides that this is getting boring and will now amuse himself by vomiting on the stupid human's pillow.",1,aww
Someone please reverse this lol,1,aww
I am I pit bull and I am offended by OP and her seizures,1,aww

Omg what a champ haha,1,aww
Goodest of the good boys! <3,1,aww
Wow,1,aww
I was very curious as to how you train a dog to do this. I was, let down.,1,aww
This is one of the cooler things I've seen on here about dogs.,1,aww
Is this a exercise to acclimate the pup? I've never witnessed a seizure that was that "controlled". My father use to have gran mal seizures, they were violent and hard, not like this.,1,aww
So much dog love!,1,aww
If we can create dogs out of wolves why cant we create good people out of shitty people?,1,aww
OMG, I almost cried.,1,aww
Awww, good dog.,1,aww
Dogs are so loving and most of the times better than humans at understanding emotions !,1,aww
I like how he's  just like "I love my job." theres just a satisfied look on hos face.,1,aww
Omg, I love dogs.,1,aww
My dog something similar when I'm doing push ups. And once, my sister told me she passed out and my dog ran to her quickly. Good thing my mother was there to take her to the hospital because I wasn't home. She's a good dog that loves us, and my family loves her.,1,aww
Just a reminder that dogs are awesome animals. I can't wait to get a place of my own so I can get one.,1,aww
God dammit dogs are the fucking best,1,aww
THis is the sweetest thing I've seem all day. I volunteer at my local SPCA & there are so so many pit bulls that go unadopted cause of their reputation I guess, its sad really. Most are good dogs...,1,aww
As an epileptic, I wish I had one of these little guys,1,aww
*I'm sobbing.*,1,aww
Well that made me cry... =),1,aww
Good dog.,1,aww
I'm crying??,1,aww
Good doggo.,1,aww

Many epilepsy service dogs are actually trained to identify psychogenic spells that aren't epileptic seizures.  http://www.neurology.org/content/68/4/E2.full.pdf,1,aww
I wish my dog gave a damn about me,1,aww
Wonderful animal, dogs are amazing!,1,aww

TBH I thought her hair was a werewolfs face transforming.,1,aww
So is no one going to point out that someone just filmed this and let the girl smack her head on the ground?Good dog?,1,aww
Is it bad that the human looks more like a dog than the dog did?,1,aww
Dogs are pure. Nothing more needs to be said.,1,aww
We don't deserve dogs,1,aww
"No human! The floor is hard, headbutt me instead!",1,aww
My dog literally ran straight into my nuts while I was watching this,1,aww
We do not deserve dogs. Damn that's beautiful.,1,aww
I have no idea how people live without dogs. Some people have apartments with rules against that, but if you are able to get a dog you should have one. They're fucking great. No better feeling after a shit day of work or school coming home to your dog that acts like he hasn't seen you in decades.,1,aww
why is it filming,1,aww
So who has the camera on the floor and is just watching,1,aww
This made me shed some tears of joy!,1,aww
That is impressive,1,aww
I thought the girl was lying on her back. Scrolled through the comments and didn't understand why no one was commenting on crazy face. Scrolled back to video and realized that I was trippin',1,aww
Very good dog, but not great that he stopped to film it first,1,aww
just get a floor made of pillows,1,aww
I think he's just trying to chill.,1,aww
Bless this pup, bless the trainer, and bless whoever realized the possibilities and benefits of service animals.  A strong bond of trust & love on both sides, and living fuller lives made possible.Thankyou!,1,aww
This is love,1,aww

Haha his face once he's under her it's like he knows he's doing his job and is saying "this will pass, don't worry.",1,aww
This is so frickin amazing/cool. It trips me out how smart dogs are and what they can be trained to do.,1,aww

When I suffered with epilepsy (thankfully I don't anymore) my dog used to just bark at me. Everytime. Maybe he thought he was gonna scare away the seizure lol. Who knows?? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️,1,aww
Very cool (not to mention **cute**), but I was under the impression that the initial fall and tongue biting/ choking were the main dangers involved with seizures. Can the dog catch her too, cause thay would be so cool.,1,aww
Who's going to set this to Smells like teen spirit?,1,aww
And now I have a nightmare image of a woman convulsing on the floor and the poor dog laying there with her, in an empty house, until she dies, right there on the dog's side. . . .,1,aww
This warmed my heart so much.Good boy.,1,aww
Who's filming this?,1,aww
r/thisismylifenow,1,aww
i need such a pet :'(,1,aww
more than a pet,1,aww
What a great doggo,1,aww
This is one of the most touching things I've ever seen. I don't care if the dog was trained or not, if the person is faking it to get a reaction from the pup. It's just touching, no explanation needed.,1,aww
"Look at me, I'm a pillow!",1,aww
How come dogs can somehow sense things like Seizures, cancers and blood sugar levels?Humans are so boring, we grow fingernails...no special powers (excluding the fact we are the most sentient beings on earth),1,aww
Thats pretty cool.,1,aww
What a good boy,1,aww
Pure love.,1,aww
Dogs are so great!,1,aww
[deleted],1,aww
This is awesome. But if it were me and my pit in this situation, he would just lick my face...,1,aww
My dog does this as well. When I lay on the floor she will do her best to force her way under me. Seems like a submissive/snuggle thing that has the added benefit of helping those who suffer siezures,1,aww
I'm not crying, I'm just sweating from my eyeballs.,1,aww
Ugh this makes me tear up just watching. I've had a few unknown seizures and it made me feel so good seeing how he was protecting her. hitting your head and waking up with that feeling is awful. good doggo.,1,aww
We don't deserve the love of dogs,1,aww
What a good boy (or girl), and what a blessing for that human.,1,aww
Whoever is training this dog KUDOS. That is some difficult upper level work that dog is doing right there.,1,aww

I don't understand what is having a seizure,1,aww
Mans eternal best friend.,1,aww
Having a seizure seems so scary to me. I hope to god I never have one.,1,aww
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen,1,aww
Amazing to know that this is a thing. When I was 7 or 8 my mother had a super intense grand mal. Cracked her head on the floor before I realized I should have placed something under her. To prevent anything further I put my foot under her head and kept it there, sock went from white to pure red, foot was bruised to hell. I'll never forget how quickly a small head injury can unload a pint of blood. Without anyone around it could have easily turned fatal. Since then she's owned dogs, they sense her auras before she does and make a point to sit by her side. I imagine this pitbull can do the same, at the first sign of one coming on it's likely preparing to go into action.As someone who now has epilepsy it might be time to get myself a dog.,2,aww
Dogs don't live long enough.  We need therapy robots.,1,aww
The goodest boy,1,aww
It was probably answered but I dont have the gumption to read through over 1000 replies but does the doggo act quicker in real situations? It looks like he is taking his time.,1,aww
I have a brother who has a seizure disorder and I wish he wasn't scared of dogs and I wasn't allergic to dogs it would be nice to know there was a dog that could help him if he has a seizure and I'm not there,1,aww
The extent of animal intelligence and compassion never ceases to amaze.,1,aww
That's the position I get in when I want to cuddle,1,aww
This makes me want to cry. Animals are so smart. (Obviously I know this is a trained animal but it's amazing they can be trained to recognize the signs/behaviors).,1,aww

Is this safe for the dogs?  I know kids who had seizures when I went to school and normally space is cleared for them cause they could harm themselves or others while they experienced their seizure. This is a serious question.,1,aww

My dog is better than any barometer. You know rain or a storm is coming. When she starts shaking and less on the floor.,1,aww
Any time I see a post like this now I'm reminded of the dog trained to console an autistic person during an emotional breakdown.

Why did this make me so emotional... love a pit <3,1,aww
Outta curiosity, is a dog putting it's head beneath the head of someone seizuring up a safe thing? Someone with epilepsy told me once that when someone is convulsing they can seriously hurt others because their body practically becomes a rock.I'm not condemning or anything. I'm just curious. I do understand no one would put a dog's safety in jeopardy.,1,aww

Gotta love animals. The things they can feel and detect!,1,aww
Without guessing at what the dog is thinking about the situation. I'm amazed they managed to teach the dog the action that is required. I haven't had a dog in a long time. And to the best of my recollection, it's hard to teach a dog to do anything that it didn't already want to do. I have no idea how they might have gotten the dog to do this the first time around,1,aww
Best thing I've seen all day.,1,aww
Good dog!Dogs are so helpful. Mine does something similar when I am working out at home doing push ups or planks. He gets under me so it's easier to exercise. My performance increases drastically when he does this.,1,aww
God damn dogs are just absolutely ***amazing***,1,aww
Ohhhh what a precious baby!!!,1,aww
He's like ohhhhyyyeeeaaaahhhh, human head hugs!!,1,aww
I'm glad she has this dog ! She probably is very thankful !!!,1,aww

It still amazes me how dogs can be trained for this. What would we do without them.,1,aww
Believe it or not, when getting a Red Cross Life-Gaurd certification they specifically tell you not to do this, and nobody could tell me why I'm told not to put a rug or my hand underneath their head,1,aww

Dogs........fuckin eh man.,1,aww

Dogs, as always, are better than people.,1,aww
That's a cool ass dog!Service dogs rock!I wish nobody ever needed one but I'm eternally grateful for these beautiful loving animals and the love they give to their partners.*BUT* to the people who discriminate against pit bulls simply for being a pit bull (or any animal for its breed) would be the same type of person to discriminate against a person based on race or even just a stereotype. Harboring this type of mentality is just ignorant and shameful and should call for deep introspective to see who the real monster is.,1,aww
this is sweet and sad but also just amazing, wow,1,aww

That's a good dog,1,aww
That is truly amazing.,1,aww
I've had certain dogs that belong to friends that can tell when something is "off." None of the dogs I've ever owned have ever had that ability nor have they ever seemed particularly concerned after a seizure. Maybe I just have dogs that are assholes.,1,aww
Oh my god I want to cry,1,aww
Dog's like, "ok now a bit to the left, oooh yeah",1,aww
That is... amazing.,1,aww

I've only personally witnessed one seizure in a person. Her movements (thrashings, really) were so violent. Do some people mildly seize? (For lack of a better term) f that dog got under her, he would have been crushed. It was awful.,1,aww

Serious question: if someone living alone with their service dog has a seizure, would the dog try to call(?) for help?I realize that people prone to seizures probably don't live on their own, but I'm concerned/curious.,1,aww
How beautiful,1,aww
The dog is like, "I like food" in such a serious situation lol. Cute af.,1,aww
This actually made me curious.. do service dogs get really sad when this happens or do they not understand and just know what to do in the event?Stupid question maybe..,1,aww
That dog should've called 911 instead.,1,aww

Love seeing all the stupid "we don't deserve dogs" when the whole reason they're domesticated is because of humans taming them for thousands and thousands of years, back to neanderthal days. So, ya, i'd say we kinda do deserve dogs, considering we've helped them evolve quite a bit and be able to live longer, healthier lives instead of being mangled out in nature by another predator. It's amazing that we've domesticated dogs enough for them to be able to learn things like this if trained well. Harsh reality that some people just don't get, I guess.,1,aww
Kinda weird that you mention the breed. No other posts mentions non pit breeds when referring to service dogs, do they?I smell an agenda.,1,aww
Totally vicious. No way should it be allowed around kids. It's clearly trying to get to get throat. /sJesus Christ, how could anyone hate this bundle of adorable? My dad's pitbull has gotten mean lately because he kicks the poor thing. But whenever I'm over there he's as sweet as could be, would never hurt a soul. Except maybe my dad.,-15,aww

This is not a pitbull.  She said herself this is a Weimaraner/lab mix.,1,aww
Seizures can sometimes be violent.  I don't think a seizure victim should be slamming his/her head on a dog much less a pitbull who might take it the wrong way.,1,aww
Seems like some serious cranial percussion is already transpiring before doggy gets in place.  A helmet makes more sense.,1,aww
<3 dogs so much. Thanks for this OP.,1,aww

It is a beautiful thing. We surely do not deserve dogs and their love. But we need them.,1,aww
Dogs are such lovely hearts.,1,aww
And people say all pitbulls are vicious,1,aww
I don't believe the title is accurate (or is at least just a joke). You don't protect the head of seizure patient like this, and in fact you don't touch them at all.,1,aww
I absolutely love pitbulls. They're such good dogs.,1,aww
Always curious when I see these types of videos. But who sets up the camera.,1,aww
What a good dog :),1,aww

Very touching... But how/why was this being filmed? Genuine question, like... did they feel it coming on, where they exercising or something before the seizure came on?,1,aww

Another good reason not to ban pits, this isn't even a pit but most people watching won't notice that because of the similarities. I won't deny that pits bite a lot, but the statistics for them are inflated because of how often people can't recognize a pit from a lab mix or other mix breed.,0,aww

This makes me want to cry. I grew up with pit bulls and very much love the breed.  My husband has epilepsy, so I've seen some pretty bad seizures and try to be with him if he's feeling unwell.  He can function without a service dog, but for those who cannot, I'd say pit bulls are best type of dog to have.,0,aww
Camera man should definitely be trying to help.,0,aww
Ok.. and who was filming?,0,aww
So instead of helping you just sat there and recorded it?,0,aww
Why is this being filmed?,0,aww
So.... who set the camera up?,0,aww
I think this is awsome, but I cant help but wonder how this was filmed...,0,aww
Serious question: does the head move like this during a seizure ? Wouldn't the body flail as well?,0,aww
What type of seizure is that?!,0,aww
Getting rid of the hard wood floor would be another thing to consider,0,aww
Is this practice or video of the real thing?,0,aww
so I'm not sure how these videos are made. Does the subject know that the seizure is coming so places a video nearby to film it occur?,0,aww
Wait, who is filming this and why aren't they doing anything?,0,aww
You could get a helm....I guess vanity prevents that.,0,aww
i really wonder if that dog knows whats happening and that her owner is having a seizure or if the dog just expects treats,0,aww

Must animal species enjoys companionship. Sadly i hear time and time again from dog owners or cat owners that their pet doesn't need another companion as they spend plenty of time with their pet, they just forget that they sleep 8 hours every day and work 8 hours or more so thats 16 hours already every day their pet is alone. Or they will say oh but it will become less interested in me if i have another pet. That is definitely not my experience, quite the contrary. Pets give each other something that a human will never ever be able to provide.,8,aww

I love that puppies want to do this. If you look through my posts you can see the picture I posted a while back of my 9 month old Basset puppy sleeping on top of his nine-year-old Basset brother. He outweighed his brother considerably and was considerably larger even though he was considerably younger. He was so big it was hard to think of him as being a puppy. But he still loved to snuggle and when Barney, the older one, was dying of cancer, Murphy would curl up around him on the dog bed and keep him warm. It was so sweet.,2,aww

I fucking hate cuddling when I'm awake. I get to hot too easily and uncomfortable immediately. But I've had girl friends stay over knowing I hate cuddling.

I am the sleeping dog.,2,aww

The goggles she's wearing are RexSpecs! We got a pair for my golden who lost an eye due to a tumor. (We wanted to protect his only good eye on walks in the woods) They take a little to get them used to but they look awesome and he can still see great with them on.,37,aww
Frida sweetie you're doing amazing,23,aww
I tried to get some boots for my Corgi like that but her little legs are too much like stumps.,34,aww
Frida you're doing great sweetie,36,aww
Frida is awesome and she looks so dapper!,15,aww
She looks like she knows how bad this is, and is sad.,16,aww
As impressive as that is, I'm also amazed by the PPE for dogs.,14,aww
Good dog!,11,aww
Good girl!,12,aww
*El perro, el perro, es mi corazón*,9,aww
What a good girl, however it looks like she has had just about enough of this shit!,11,aww
All doggos are good doggos, but this doggo is best doggo 🐶,47,aww
LPT: Marina is Spanish for “Navy”. She’s part of the Mexican navy. Stop saying that’s her name.,36,aww

"Who's a good girl? You're a good girl!",4,aww
53 and counting... this girl just saved my soul,5,aww
The real MVP!!!!! 🙌🏾👏🏾,4,aww
Good girl,6,aww
She didn't save 52 people in Mexico, she saved about 20 between Oaxaca and CDMX. The 52 include all her career, that means haiti, ecuador, guatemala, and mexico's disasters.,5,aww
What a good doggo! I have a yellow lab. He doesn't save lives... Just likes to launch himself into windows and try to hump his younger brothers.,4,aww
# Good Girl# Very, very good,6,aww
Since myself and this savior share a name, I of course have saved every comment praising Frida by name so I can look back at it when having a bad day.,6,aww
This isn't awww it's badass.  Semper Fido Marine Doggo.,6,aww
I hope she doesn't get stressed like the 9/11 dogs did in the beginning.,3,aww
[Here's Frida, taking a break right now](https://i.imgur.com/Z5P1Y9h.jpg).,4,aww

Good girl Frida!! Your such a good girl!,3,aww
Is there any science behind if she can grasp what she's doing? Does she understand she's saving people or is it a game to her?,3,aww
she looks so tired,3,aww
How many of them were those bad hombres our precedent warned us about? Checkmark agnostics!,3,aww
Dem lil bootsies,3,aww
Frida earns a lifetime of chew toys and biscuits!,3,aww
I just want to give her endless hugs and treats <3 endless!,3,aww
God bless you Frida,3,aww
God bless your work Frida.And God bless your handlers.,3,aww
Goodest girl ever,3,aww
Is there anywhere we may send treats and toys to her and all the other rescue dogs?,3,aww
Aaaaaaaah the goggles!!!!!,3,aww
Frida looks like she's about to give out some serious snuggles after saving everyone.,3,aww
My mother was in Mexico City during the earthquake of 85 and from what my dad told me she helped out as a makeshift nurse to help out people. She went by Frida and she was the best mom ever, so naturally this gets my upvote and a smile from me :),3,aww
Angel covered in fur. Love.,3,aww
Bless her soul 💗,3,aww
She's a good girl ❤️,3,aww
We don't deserve dogs,3,aww
G L O V E B O Y E E,3,aww
Never more fitting time than this for the phrase, "good dog",3,aww
And she has lovely little boots 🐶💖,3,aww
People saw her coming and were like "Thank God It's Frida",3,aww
What has mankind done to deserve dogs?,3,aww
r/dogswithjobs,3,aww
What did we do to deserve dogs?,3,aww
You can just call her Frida; animal names do not require quotation marks.,7,aww
Fine. I'll ask.Why is Frida in quotation marks?,4,aww
Wow! And she's a doge Marine!,2,aww
Doggles.,2,aww
Good girl!,2,aww
Frida is so cool she puts up with doggles and dhoes and still does her job.,2,aww
Is that a US Marine behind that good dog?Edit: apparently the Mexican federal police have a utility uniform with a copy of MARPAT.,2,aww
We must knight her immediately!,2,aww
Myheart.,2,aww
You wanna get on my good side trump!? Give this dog a Medal of Honor for being a good doggo,2,aww
She looks like she's about to say "I'm too old for this shit",2,aww
Good girl,2,aww
She needs back socks!,2,aww
I just made a noise I didn't know a 24 year old man could make seeing this.,2,aww
V good Doggo!!,2,aww
The goodest of girls,2,aww
In the name of all that is holy, find this dog and do a "After I told her she's a good girl" meme photo.  PLEASE!!!!!,2,aww
Isn't it amazing that if the saved people could have somehow, somewhere read their destinies where it would have been written: "Will almost die in an earthquake. Will be saved by a dog.", they would have definitely not believed it?,2,aww
This shouldn't be on r/aww this should be on r/badassasfuck,2,aww
She just does it for the treats. Dogs that are trained to find people like this have to be given treats after every person they find or else they stop looking for people. A bit greedy if you ask me.Just kidding of course, this dog is a hero :),2,aww
If pinned under some concrete or other heavy material, have a dog wearing goggles come up on me, I'd be comforted, assume gonna make it. Dog wearing goggles is some serious shit,2,aww
It's fine that everyone is feeling joy for this wonderful hero Frida; however, one thing to keep in mind is that many of the heroes scouring rubble in this tragic event are going to possibly have severe health problems in the future months/years. Let's keep that in mind, because these people and animals are making a tremendous sacrifice. God bless Mexico! God bless America!,2,aww
And was rewarded with 52 good girl,2,aww
She should give back Marinas vest.,2,aww
Got respect for Frida.,2,aww
Meanwhile you have some shitty cultures out there, that are fine with eating dogs.,2,aww
I'm surprised the rear paws aren't protected as well. After building collapses I'd expect there'd be broken glass everywhere. EDIT: NM https://i.imgur.com/bftD1Kp.jpg,2,aww
What an amazing dog, Lassie ain't got nothing on Frida!,2,aww
I'm wondering if she was named after the famous Mexican painter/icon [Frida Kahlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo),2,aww
¡Muchas gracias Frida! Eres una buena perra. :),2,aww
WTG Frida.  I'm also glad to see they are protecting her feet and her eyes!  Good Girl!,2,aww

Good puppy!,2,aww
Who's a good hero??,2,aww
Cute little thing, here have a karma,2,aww
I hope those good things stay safe through aftershocks and secondary disasters, along with people of course. Her going into half-collapsed buildings is a really scary sight.,2,aww
Bless this angel and everyone working to help the people in mexico. So heartbreaking,2,aww
I've read that for really bad disasters, rescue dogs get sad when they can't find anyone alive. In such cases they'll have a rescuer pretend to be found by the dog to cheer the rescue pupper up. Such good puppers. The very best puppers.,2,aww
Well. I should just give up now. This dog is far more than I could ever hope to be. A very good girl.,2,aww
Look at her little goggles!,2,aww
Good girl!,2,aww

Good dog. However many pets she gets, it isn't enough.,2,aww
She is Mexican celebrity now even my grandma told me about her,2,aww
Hehe her little front shoes,2,aww
I'm probably late to the party, but I was wondering,Can these dogs tell the difference between "practice" and the real thing? Would they have more urgency in a real live situation and can they also adapt better? I'm posing this question to all trained dogs; Sniffers, K-9, Guide dogs, etc,2,aww
Marina is the Organisation she ,,works,, for,2,aww
She is a strong dog and a good trainer,2,aww
Jesus christ look at those little slippers. I. Can't. Handle. It.,2,aww
Is there a way that I could donate some money towards buying Frida a toy or some treats?,2,aww
What a heckin good doggo,2,aww
Hard working dogs, hard working people. All with hearts of gold and souls headed to whatever the greatest rewards are for the good samaritans that help those who need it.,2,aww
Frida is a good girl and hero for certain but the number saved in the earthquake was 12. She has over 50 saves in her career though. You may  be cool but never be Frida :) :),2,aww
Guess I'm just stoned but I read this title as Frida being a human woman and I didn't read the subreddit and thought it was an article about an amazing real life superhero till now,2,aww
It’s unreal how amazing dogs are, they best give her the biggest damn treat ever, what a hero dog,2,aww

She's a good dog but hasn't saved 53 lives, only 12, and that's throughout her entire career, not just from this one Mexico earthquake.> "According to Mexican Naval Captain, De Fragata Israel Monterde, Frida has helped to locate 53 people throughout her career in various disaster zones across Mexico, Honduras, Ecuador and Haiti. Of those 53, 12 were found alive." - [BBC: Meet Frida, Mexico’s hero canine who’s saved 12 lives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/b71065eb-d88f-4db4-bbc0-95d885cc4886),2,aww

My dog can't even find her ball cos its behind a plant pot.....but as much as I love hearing about hero dogs, I can't help but feel a bit sad that they won't ever truly understand how special they are & that not all dogs are capable of doing such an important & dangerous job. Its all in a days work for them.,1,aww

That's awesome. She's done wonderful job. It's time now that she be retired. That's horrifying work.,1,aww
That dog is a winner for sure! Well done boy!,1,aww

I got myself a Basset Hound when I left my parents home, previously I had a German shepherd which I trained in my teens. Their character is quite different, one being a Hound and the other a Shepherd. On holidays at my parent's I took them both on a hike. The basset, as per usual tries to go in front tracking small prey ,which he does sometimes, even though I don't hunt, and he just stands there looking at the rabbit/mice when eventually he gets one out of hiding. That day he went and ran way too far. So I told my long-haired German Shepherd to go fetch him, he starts running and cuts right in front of the Basset's way looking at him. The small-legged Basset stops, looks at him and then tries to pass under the shepherd's watch, the shepherd barks at him and then the Basset comes running back to me. From then on, everytime the Basset would look like he would get away from near me,  the German Shepherd would run in front of him and bring him back.Genetics and instincts are something amazing.,550,aww

It's funny how much cats fight versus how much dogs fight. Our dog brawled probably one or two times in his lifetime. Our cat is surprisingly still alive with how much scars he's got. Village cats are hardcore.,202,aww

How embarrassing.,5,aww
My Pomeranian is always the cat referee. We don't have a lot of fighting, but our one permanent cat is deaf and blind. Our dog is very protective of him. He is so wary when our fosters meet the cat and frequently breaks up play time.We also currently have a litter of kittens. Poor dog is so stressed out about keeping them safe.  https://imgur.com/RGJO6bq.jpg Tuukka and Stephen, BFFL'S,4,aww
Dogs are even a cat's best friend .....,6,aww

I think it’s crazy one species can read another’s body language yet many humans remain clueless when an animal is pissed off.,4,aww
Maybe the cat is wearing her leash just because of the dog. She certainly provokes every stranger. So the owner has trained  a pacifist safety dog team for her.,7,aww
I too have a cat named [mittens](https://imgur.com/F4Din2v),7,aww

My Weimaraner did this to his cat once when a stray tried to make our backyard its home. I had the cat on a leash but my Weimaraner came over and picked up his cat (he picked the kitten up in his mouth out of a box of free to good home kittens and that's how we got the cat) and started walking towards the porch till he realized the cat was still on a leash and just game me this bewildered and annoyed look that made me think "I don't want my cat getting Feline AIDS fucker, let's go." Got my spray bottle of vinegar and tagged the stray till it went away. Got me some roosters the following week from my cousin's farmstead. So now we got no snakes, coons, or stray cats in our backyard. At least no living ones. Had to toss a coon carcass they were eating from in the black fly larvae box for my aquaponics system and give the brothers some black fly larvae for their good work (chickens love black fly larvae).,3,aww

Man, I swear dogs have special predisposition toward harm prevention. On 2 different occasions and with 2 different dogs, one would always run over and paw me over whenever I start nervously biting my nails and another broke up a fight between my ex and I. He was watching us having an argument on the sofa and as temper rose as we got louder and louder. Finally he jumped on to the sofa and also lodged himself between us while pawing my face to shut the fuck up (he was my dog so he felt comfortable doing that).Cracked us up and stopped the fight cold, and I still have flashbacks of his human-like, genuinely concerned face pawing at my lips to this day.,2,aww

We had gotten kittens and wanted to see how they would react to the outdoors. We lived on a busy street so we were unsure if we should let them out. My cat bolted toward the front yard immediately. My 10 year old German Shepherd hunted him down, and carried him by the scruff of his neck in her teeth back to us and dropped him at our feet. Sweetest thing ever and maybe saved his life.,2,aww

This is my stick. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My stick is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My stick, without me, is useless. Without my stick, I am useless. I must fetch my stick true. I must fetch quicker than retrievers and spaniels who are trying to steal from me. I must fetch sticks before they fetch before me. And I will.,2,aww
I've literally said this before and here I find myself saying it again...what's with these gifs of dogs with photoshopped oversized-sticks?,2,aww
my brother's border collie loooooved fetch. on walks she would find sticks and bring them to us to throw for her. walking along the beach there's a telephone pole-sized tree that had washed up. she stops at it, looks hard, then looks back at me. i give her the dog head turn. "what?" she looks back at the "stick", then back at me with the "this-one-seems-good look". i say, "yeah. probably not". she continues her search for a good throwing stick,2,aww
Fake or not this is a VERY good boy,2,aww
Too bad it’s a fake.,9,aww
This is funny but fake look at the right of the stick it sinks into the ground.,10,aww
Perfectly balanced,5,aww
Awww...he is such a cutie pie!  Now how are you going to throw it so he can fetch it again??,3,aww
This is almost the perfect little gif for what I've been looking for nearly all night. Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.Good doggo and human,3,aww

To all of the people who think this is fake you should spend more time with dogs.  There was a dog in my neighborhood who would drag trees like that out of the river.  My medium sized female dog regularly picks up logs her own weight.  Dogs are very strong.,2,aww
Yeah, edited. Watch the stick go through the ground at the beginning.,2,aww

I always thought that dogs were domesticated to help with hunting, fending off attackers, etc.These are masculine endeavors.  I just suddenly realized that maybe that's a long-con cover story because the real reason they got so friendly with us is that they'd bring firewood to the women to start a fire.,1,aww
He's gona be disappointed when his human can't throw it very far...at all lol,1,aww

No aww post can make me like pits. I get that a lot of their bad behavior is due to bad owners but they were bred for murder and it's in their dna. Even good owners can't fully control their pits.,1,aww

A friend’s dog did something like this - after a big storm I took him for a walk in the park, and he found a sapling that had been totally blown out of the ground.  It was a bit thinner, but still had roots and all the branches and leaves and he had to drag it over but he was so Proust of himself!  I was very sorry I couldn’t throw it for him, but I did tear off a branch for him instead. He was a skinny spaniel cross too, so it was quite impressive he managed it.,1,aww
I instinctively protected my shins. My doggies didn't raise no fool!,1,aww

My Staffie did this all the time, never found one this big though!Quick story. Leon (as was his name) obviously loved his sticks and in the forest we took him for walks in was a rope swing. For whatever reason he'd always ignored it till one day he suddenly bolted out of the car door ran in the direction of the swing. I'd probably lost him for a good couple minutes and much to my amusement when I did find him he was hanging in mid air on the swing (made from a nice long solid stick) swaying back and forth. Wish we had mobile phone video cameras in those days, but it was hilarious.He would not let go of it either.,1,aww
He's just working out...,1,aww

Seems right.A friend’s pit that was about the size of a small horse loved to get a downed branch or log and bring it over to you like it was fetch time.Good demo of how they are terrifying lumps of jaws and muscle, but are just as much of a derp as any other breed.,1,aww
Now you’ll have to reward him with a treat just as big.. Just... do it.,1,aww

Reminds me of a doggo I met while on vacation as a kid. The place we stayed had a couple of house dogs and one was severely abused as a puppy before being adopted by the owner we stayed with. As a result he would never lie down to sleep. He always fell asleep standing up and then would fall on his face after a few minutes. We felt so bad for the poor guy, but towards the end of our week long stay he had become so comfortable with us that he started to lay down to nap! It made 10 year old me so happy to see that.,1,aww
This reminds me of my cousins dog, who is the same breed. His name is Celsius and is a very good boye :),1,aww

COMMENT,SCORE,SUBREDDIT
I used to have three dogs in the house, one was an australian shepherd that was the most intelligent animal i have ever known.    When ever the other two dogs were doing something bad some where else in the house the aussie used to find me and sit next to me  so i could see he wasn't involved.    Any time that dog came into the room and sat  at attention I just knew it was time to go investigate what the others were up to.,4559,aww
Dude if the cat is ashamed someone is probably dead.,9460,aww
The dog looks like it's taking legal advice from the cat.,15128,aww
Well let's start with my heart.,18561,aww
Poop in shoes?,975,aww
It's nice that it was a team effort.,324,aww

I bark the fifth.,948,aww
someone pooped in the house and the other ate it.  My golden used to constantly eat my orange cats poop.  no idea why but it was obvious.  I swear my golden enjoyed poop more than any other food.,134,aww
Please keep us updated!,251,aww
One time my family came home from dinner and our dog, who usually greeted us, sunkered away in the living room instead. I knew something was up so I ran around the house trying to find what I knew was going to be poop so I could clean it up before mom found out and threw a fit. Lucky never would have been able to understand, but it was found downstairs and i cleaned it and none were the wiser... RIP Lucky dog,509,aww
We need an update!,59,aww
Just my gut instinct, but the cat is guilty.,206,aww
Please let us know when you find out what they did.... other than breaking a few reddit hearts,40,aww
Cat is telling Dog all the horrible things about humans. Dog's mind can barely handle it.,35,aww
I FORGIVE THEM,24,aww
Cat: “don’t make eye contact”Dog: “too late. They’re on to us”,23,aww
Curious minds want to know.... What did they do?,21,aww
Cat: "Take the heat for this and I promise much treats. Trust me. Shh, he's watching.",40,aww
If I was a dog, I’d purposely look guilty on occasion just to mess with my owners head. I’d watch him/her go crazy frantically looking around the house, to not find anything destroyed or puked/pooped/peed on.,19,aww
CAT: Yo man. Keep it all the way G my G, you don’t say *shit*, y’hear me?DOG: Yo Devaughn, I don’t think I’m strong enough for this.DEVAUGHN: Yo what did you just call me?,118,aww
Something interesting I heard recently in a Terry Gross Fresh Air interview:>Some of the experiments I do are testing, for instance, anthropomorphisms, attributions that we make of dogs. One of my favorites was of the guilty look. Dogs show this guilty look, pulling their ears back and pulling their tail under their body or turning away. Often, owners know when they've done something wrong. So it's fair for people to say that dogs look guilty. But I thought, that's a strange attribution. How can we be sure that dogs are guilty? And so I did a little test to see if the guilty look popped up only when they'd done something wrong or in any other circumstance.>GROSS: What did you find?>HOROWITZ: And it's a really simple experiment. And I found that the guilty look showed up more often when they were being scolded or about to be scolded by their owners, whether or not they'd done something wrong. And so it looks like we really prompt the dogs to put on this look, which is probably more aptly described as a submissive look or a concerned look, than a guilty look. I'm not saying that dogs don't feel guilt. They very well might, but this look isn't showing us that.From here:https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561551389/from-fire-hydrants-to-rescue-work-dogs-perceive-the-world-through-smell,107,aww
You know it's bad when the *cat* is looking guilty.,31,aww
[deleted],15,aww
Did you check the backyard? Sprinklers/new holes in the yard?Be sure to check your bed, as well! And any cables you have! Tv, console, PC,14,aww
One probably puked and the other ate it. At least that's how it goes at my place.,9,aww
OMG the way the cat sits! Is it the Japanese way?,9,aww
You'll probably smell it real soon.  :),8,aww
So, what did they break, OP? TELL MEEEEEE! 😯,9,aww
Cat.,49,aww
This is kind of like a treasure hunt game! So interesting :),7,aww
On behalf of reddit, they're forgiven.,6,aww
Poor babies! I had a dog that would do that to me quite often when I came home from work. For the longest time I couldn't figure out what she was "guilty" of. I finally figured it out after about two months of her giving me that look.... She was guilty of sleeping on our dirty clothes! I finally convinced her it was okay, but she still had a bit of guilty look sometimes. Sweet hearts.,7,aww
Cat's don't give a fuck about breaking or damaging human stuff, so if the cat is bashful its something more serious.They've probably been fucking.,12,aww
They're about to break your karma.,9,aww
I'd check under the bed first.. mine looooove to bring whatever they destroy under the bed,4,aww
Your hea- oh thats been taken...Ill just go now...,5,aww
Does this look like a painting to anyone else?,5,aww
Perfect title.  Props.,4,aww
Check their teeth! Who pooed in the house and who ate it? Joking but not joking...,4,aww
When even the cat is embarrassed, you *know* shit went bad,4,aww
Lol it looks like the cat is whisper to the dog, "say anything and i'll kill you....",5,aww
The dog is definitely in submissive mode and accordingly almost certainly is aware of having done something that has gotten him in trouble in the past.  The cat doesn't give a shit and is there either by happenstance, or because the dog is his particular friend and he's showing affection.,5,aww
We have the same kitty!!!,6,aww
Lean on me... when you're not strong.,4,aww
DID YOU FIND IT? WHAT DID THEY DOOOO?,4,aww
The cat took a crap and the dog ate it.,5,aww
How bout the internet?,4,aww
update?,4,aww
I think they were making out. And now they are both ashamed about it. What happens in the pantry stays in the pantry!,5,aww
Aww pawtners in crime,4,aww
The cat is calmly, rationally explaining the consequences of busting him out to the hoomans, the dog want's to go witness protection, but doesn't know how to get that ball rolling.,4,aww
The cat can't even bear your gaze. Guilty AF,3,aww
They conspired and killed the neighbors pets,3,aww
You know they broke something when the cat is hiding in shame as cats usually don't give a fuck. Source: own a cat and can confirm they don't care about anything except food.Edit: cat probs puked and the dog ate it,3,aww
99% chance the cat did it.,3,aww
That's a dog that has eaten cat shit.,3,aww
They both look like siblings that got in trouble. Details: The cat is the younger sister and the dog is the brother,3,aww
Yeah, the cat ate everything out of the litter box again.,3,aww
I recommend you not jump into bed tonight, but approach cautiously,3,aww
Oh I know that look.  It’s gonna be expensive,3,aww
Ha ha! That's hilarious.. You will.. ; ),3,aww
They didn't break anything. They're hiding their forbidden love.,3,aww
It's been four hours. Have you found it yet?,3,aww
They broke my heart.,3,aww
How topical...from next week's *New Yorker*:https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/59fcc974f40de92b73812f44/master/w_964,c_limit/171113_a21400_rd2.jpg,3,aww
They didn't break but melted my heart after seeing this,3,aww
The cat be like : "Hey Doggo, could you smirk and repeat “On the advice of counsel I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and respectfully decline to answer your question” ?",3,aww
My grandfather was a farmer and my mom said the dog once slunk into the house covered in mud looking totally guilty. Turned out he buried a goose. My grandfather later found a hole in the ground, feathers everywhere, and an extremely muddy goose that apparently managed to unearth itself.,3,aww
They look so heckin' guilty,3,aww
They had sex.,3,aww
They probably pooped and ate it.,3,aww
He may have tried to hump the cat, she's underage.. Wait a minute is that Hollywood star Air Bud?? What's going on with Hollywood these days?,3,aww
They surely did something. They are hiding something,3,aww
Cat: I did itDog: Don't get mad at cat. Maybe I did it?,6,aww
I used to come home ready because I knew my dog had been bad and been on the couch.  Dog let off a lot of fur and I hated getting it on my clothes.I would run to the couch and see if it was warm and if so I knew my couch had been sat on.  The dog would be disciplined.  (no abuse, don't freak out.  just stern voice and a finger wag)My dog went from being excited to see me come home to not and acting "in trouble" even when it did nothing.  I learned forget the couch.  Instead when I came home I would be excited to see my dog and pet my dog + give them love.TL;DR love your animals.edit: Moby Dick's plot,6,aww
They didn’t break anything. They licked their butts on your bed!,2,aww
That's what I look like when I spill the oatmeal on my boss's suit during the morning meeting.,2,aww
They don't want you to find out about their forbidden love.,2,aww
It is illegal t have pets that cute,2,aww
check under the couch,2,aww
They are guilty about something.  Wonder if you ever found out????,2,aww
I'm gonna guess they didn't break anything, but instead someone peed or pooped where the shouldn't have.  That's usually how my dogs act after.,2,aww
GUILTY. AS. FUCK.Source: Have owned both cats and a dog.,2,aww
This is too cute, I love how the cat is hiding away, I can tell he/she did it lol, it's always the cats,2,aww
Ha! Adorable! It appears they are very sorry for whatever they did.,2,aww
This photo made me realize that while they're both almost the same color, we would refer to that cat as orange, but not the dog. I've never heard anyone call a dog orange.,2,aww
[deleted],2,aww
so much shame in one photolove it,2,aww
Must be REALLY bad if even the cat is showing remorse.,2,aww
So did you find what they broke OP?,2,aww
The internet.,2,aww
I’ve got it. Same as mine. Cat pooped and doggie ate it.,2,aww
Your dog crapped in the house and your cat accidentally sprinted through it, subsequently painting the walls with it as it continued to get run.,2,aww
The cat definitely devised the cleanup plan and the dogs conscience is showing.,2,aww
Cat(in mob-like voice): “Listen here bud, be cute and calm. Cute and calm. Now—,2,aww
The cat did it.,2,aww
I’m scared...WHAT DID THEY DO?!?,2,aww
The may have eaten something.,2,aww
but look at those puppy eyes.,2,aww
If you can't find whats wrong, that's because they ate it.,2,aww
They shit. That's the same face my dog make when it shit somewhere sneaky.,2,aww
u/tashaaaaaaaaaaaa look at them,2,aww
Your cat has guilty looks?? My cat is proud and cocky as hell when he breaks shit.,2,aww
They broke the internet,2,aww
Ah, but you will!,2,aww

This was the picture taken right before catdog was born,2,aww

One pooped in the house...the other ate it.  Oh the shame,2,aww
Cat.,2,aww
Your ❣ heart,2,aww
Did you ever find out what they broke?,2,aww
This is just too cute,2,aww
Partners in crime!  Adorable!,2,aww
At least they look guilty? Mine is like, "look what I chewed up! isn't it neat!",2,aww
My heart,2,aww
Those faces. Yes. I know those faces all too well. Good luck, and happy hunting for the mistake.,2,aww
Best thread of the day.,2,aww
Where's the poop Robin?,2,aww
Maybe it's their relationship that they're ashamed of? You'd think that in 2017 a dog and cat could be friends without any social repercussions.,2,aww
They probably made a catdog.,2,aww
That’s because they ate it.,2,aww
Maybe nothing broke, just "seasoned",2,aww
My heart ❤,2,aww
 they are ashamed bc they had some sex while you were gone,2,aww
so cute,2,aww
I did, it's my heart,2,aww
Whatever it is, I doubt you'll be able to get angry at them with that face.,2,aww
Someone threw up and the other ate it.,2,aww
[You should be trying to find what broke *them*...](https://i.imgur.com/G3YYImd.jpg),2,aww
I don't even care what they broke, they're forgiven. Pardoned by cuteness overload.,2,aww
Hahaha they really can't hide their guilt.,2,aww
they broke your mind by tricking you into thinking they broke something,2,aww
Aww don’t be mad!,2,aww
Whenever I hear people say that dogs only look guilty as a response to you being mad, I think of situations like this.My dog does this too or more recently, while he won't ever run out the door for a walk when I come home, he will if he's gotten into the garbage or something.  I can't help but think he's trying to distract me or at the very least delay getting mad at him. The point is, both of these are independent of how I actually react and dependent on how he thinks I will react.,2,aww
Yup, sth's broken, pooped on or eaten.,2,aww
He looks a lot like my boyfriends dog, Zelda. Golden retriever/chowhttps://imgur.com/gallery/T9g5o,2,aww
This is how my dog looks, when my cat is in heat and has been following him around all day, rubbing her face on him and putting her butt in his face. He looks at me like 😕 "help",2,aww
r/AccidentalRenaissance,2,aww
They ate it,2,aww
100% the Cat's fault. Look at him, zero remorse.,2,aww
I have two cats and a dog, when they do this I assume one pooped and the other ate it.,2,aww
So...? What did they do? I saw this yesterday, and came back to check. Still no answer!,2,aww
They didn't break anything somebody pooped....or tore the stuffing out of something.,2,aww
The dog pooped in the litter box and the cat peed in the sock drawer. That or the cat pooped under the table and the dog ate it.,2,aww
You know one of your dogs is a cat right?,2,aww
Cat's don't give a fuck.,2,aww
DEVAUGHN: Yo what did you find it.,2,aww
awww,2,aww
haha... no kidding.,5,aww
Broke the upvote sound barrier,4,aww
It's the cat who broke it and he is just blackmailing the dog to take responsibility or cat will kill him on his sleep.Cats are always up on bookshelves and pushes things off of it.,6,aww
the cat is kneeling like it was just praying,1,aww
Or what they ate, or accidentally killed, or where they pooped? Mind you they're both in on in that's for sure!,1,aww
Did you now?!,1,aww

Cat.,1,aww
Look for that missing shoe.,1,aww
maybe the dog tried playing with the cat and got slapped,1,aww
Cant tell if Cat is remorseful or scheming...,1,aww
The dog's collar looks like a low-res texture at least in the picture I'm seeing wtf,1,aww
Dog took a dump in your closet, cat helped him hide it.,1,aww
For a cat to feel guilt, it probably murdered your child.,1,aww
Experience with my teenagers says your cat got something on her face pierced... If nothing's obvious check the tongues.,1,aww
Somebody pooped somewhere.,1,aww
I took a big sigh when I saw this.😂 the stress level goes from 1 to 50 in a heartbeat😂😂,1,aww

Dogs looking at you thinking, whys this thing head bonking meeee?,1,aww

I'm sure the cat doesn't give a fuck,1,aww
The cat is toughing the dog's heart,1,aww
Is your litter box clean? Did you or your SO clean it?,1,aww
The look latinamerican teens give their moms after having sex or drinking alcohol,1,aww

I mean we all know that face is cos the cat is rubbing himself against the dog, you see it on its hind legs. But anyway. Enjoy.,1,aww
Cute dog and cat relationship hahaha,1,aww
Why does it look kind of like a painting? Is it the light reflecting on the dog and the kind of detailless color/fur? I can't put my finger on it.,1,aww
What did they break? This must be answered.,1,aww
Where's the poop?,1,aww
Maybe they went number 1 somewhere... My dog does the same when she pee or breaks anything,1,aww
/r/GuiltyDogs,1,aww
At my house when the pets are naughty, one dog hides, the other is sorry-not-sorry, while the cat sits there looking smug.,1,aww

Time to dig through some poop.,1,aww
you can't find it because they ATE IT!!!,1,aww

Nice.......when I was a kid, I was playing badminton with my mom and dog jumped on her and broke her leg...he looked just like this after.,1,aww
I take the blame OP!!! You have to forgive them!!!,1,aww
Come on, OP, don't leave us hangin'!,1,aww
This is love and shame. Cat pooped on the floor, dog ate it to hide the evidence.,1,aww
Well have you found out about it yet,1,aww
We might all be looking at the issue from the wrong point of view 🙄,1,aww
This is super cute. Hahaha,1,aww
They either broke something or pissed somewhere in the house,1,aww
Is this a painting?,1,aww
LOL, I have the same breed of dog. They are so cute!,1,aww
Each others hearts they are working on it leave em alone.,1,aww
The cat did it.,1,aww
These eyes... are cryin'...,1,aww
Living parallel lives: red lab & orange tabby, except mine being gingers, have no remorse.,1,aww
I really love your floors. Are they real wood?,1,aww
 That look of guilt is impressive 😁,1,aww
Your heart,1,aww
If the cat's ears were down, that would mean double the damage.  :D,1,aww
Hide the evidence!,1,aww

“Is he looking?”,1,aww
Where they looking in a certain direction?,1,aww
It’s my heart,1,aww

Ooh.... but when you DO...it's gonna be a doozy.,1,aww
My cats would never show this much remorse * *sigh* *,1,aww
They could have pooped in the kitchen.  Have you checked?  My dogs used to shit in the center of the kitchen for everyone to see.....,1,aww
It's probably a secret dump they took somewhere in the house.,1,aww

i found what they broke...my heart...,1,aww
Why do your animals match and why don’t mine?,1,aww
OP ? Update plz,1,aww

Probably celibacy.,1,aww
Just spank them now and figure it out later.,1,aww

Already got one.,1,aww
That means they ate something :),1,aww
Well, whatever they broke...at least they’re sorry about it...,1,aww
That’s hilarious!,1,aww
It was the cat wasn't? I have never seen a cat show any shame before, something seems fishy,1,aww
I know that look, the dog pooped in a high heel shoe in the closet. You will find it traumatically in 6 months, and then scream/cry why god why? Much like Nancy Kerrigan, over and over.,1,aww
The cat organized this, telling dog to act guilty, and cover his head laughing. Nothing has been done, but OP is having a lot of trouble looking for it. Better prank than breaking material stuff.,1,aww
Those are two of the guiltiest looking animals ever!,1,aww
It doesn't matter. All is forgiven. Look at those eyes.,1,aww
Or it could be a bag of trash all over the bathroom,1,aww
Um. Their cuteness broke MY HEART.,1,aww
Plot twist: your dog knocked up your cat, and the pussy is ashamed.,1,aww
Quick get the Bronco!,1,aww
You forgive him right now without knowing what it is!,1,aww

We want an update!! what did they break!,1,aww
Yeah. My heart,1,aww
Your heart :'(,1,aww
A friendly friend,1,aww
Yes! My 8 year old staffy mix does this. Sometimes I’ll look for a good five minutes and find nothing, but know I have to punish her because she gave herself up. Sweetest girl, but not the brightest.,1,aww
The cat pissed on the carpet, the dog thinks you will blame him.,1,aww
It wasnt photoshop.,1,aww
Haha my dog does this all the time,1,aww
Your heart,1,aww
The dog looks like a cardboard cutout,1,aww
They’re giving you that “We might have fucked...😬” look.,1,aww
It doesn't matter, just wuv on them. :(,1,aww
That look is universal,1,aww
(Oliver Twist voice) Please sir, “more forgiveness”,1,aww
You gonna be pissed,1,aww
Nah, that’s a hidden turd look,1,aww
I miss these moments so much. We just put down our dog of 6yrs a couple days ago. Is there a sub for dog loss support?,1,aww

How come my wild hyena of a dog never acts remorseful when he rips my stuff up.,1,aww
Automatically forgiven for being cute,1,aww

They have such amazing coats. Forgive them because they're fabulous..,1,aww
They had sex.,1,aww
You will. Those are the two guiltiest fluffers I’ve ever seen lol,1,aww

They just escaped Kevin Spacey's basement.,1,aww
Doggo is deserving an beat.,1,aww
Is that a golden retriever/lab mix???,1,aww
Dog taking advice from cat? Ha ha ha.LOL,1,aww
At least they stick together.,1,aww
I️ think it might have been your face,1,aww
Pretty sure whatever they broke, the cat was the mastermind behind it. And probably whispering in the dog's ear: "If you rat me out, you better sleep with one eye open tonight",1,aww
Awwwww the kitty,1,aww
They look guilty enough to have been the sole culprits behind Chernobyl, 911, and WW1, plus WW2. Poor kids. Forgive their world ending shenanigans before treat time.,1,aww
Looks like my doggies,1,aww

Ultimate guilt.,1,aww
