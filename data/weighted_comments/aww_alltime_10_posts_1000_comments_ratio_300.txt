Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.
He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.
That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!
It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you.
If I fits, I sits
If I fits, I sits
If I fits, I sits

What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?
Love this post 🙂
Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off.
My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I’m there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot.
Now he won’t croak!
Now he won’t croak!
You are a very good human OP!!
I love you OP. ♥️ You just gave that frog the best day of his little life.
Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"😁
You rule
Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond?  Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.

The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.
*wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...
Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clip
This leapt into my heart!
I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy.
Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.
DID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY’S THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little.
I love frogs. They’re so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep.
People like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ❤ we all can learn from that!
Froggo does a soak
My name is FroggI am so hotHere comes a manWhat has he got?It is some waterSo nice and coolI will not drink myNew swimming pool!
He fit perfect in there!
He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him 😊
You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.
In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.
Good on you. But just for reference frogs don’t regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn’t effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel.
I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them
What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!
Tiniest wading pool.

This is one of the cutest “giving an animal water” videos so far. Ahhh so cute
I love frogs so small that their swimming pool is a bottle cap. So cute.
If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?
This is so wholesome.
You’re a damn saint.
Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE
It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.
 congrats on making it to the top posts of all time
So since we’re talking about caring for small animals here I thought I’d bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I’ve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I’m getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over “NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!” They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there’s no animal. It’s just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn’t amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. Welp that’s it
Kind of amazing
Stupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!
I love how he shuffled all the way to the front so it looked like he was resting his chin on the finger :’)
Doing God’s work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you
Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin.
That wiggle😍
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
He *is* drinking while soaking! That’s how frogs do it! You’re a good hooman!
When you come from a long day at work and get in the pool
Omg I love this. Little green frogs are seriously the cutest
Gud freg
"Ahhhhhhhhh, nice." Frog probably.
He just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OP
I love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, “Ugh, don’t fuck with me, it’s too hot.” Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren’t going to kill him.
Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!
/r/HumansBeingBros
That frog looked at the camera/human and was like “are you serious? For me? Okay, don’t mind if I do!”
My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.Nope.This gets my upvote nonetheless.
Quick, sign a contract with him!Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot
You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh.
You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp
 Frogs don’t physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.
He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond.
You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all time
I sent this to four of my friends and their responses were so sweet, they're all 17-19 year old dudes.  "so cute. so fucking cute""THEY BABY""Big fucking moodHe's drinking tho, thas how they do that""happy!!!!!!!!!!"I love my friends
This post is going to be one of the top posts of reddit and i feel so happy because people can learn from it and do the same
Thats how they drink
You know a post is good when it's #1 on r/aww, and has almost 300k upvotes and it's filled vertically

Oh lord that is insanely cute. Well done you.
It rubs the water on its skin so that it rehydrates again

R/humansbeingbros
As soon as he realized it was water, his need for moisture overcame his fear of humans. Such a sweet thing to see. Thank you for being such a kind person and even noticing the plight of such a little creature.
Frogs don’t “drink”, they absorb water through their skin!
amphibians absorb water through their skin so this was the same thing as a drink to him.
This is so fucking cute I actually gasped and made a weird squealing noise... he’s so happy in his tiny little pool 😭😭😭
Frogs can drink though their skin
You're a good person OP. Keep being a bro to all beings big and small
TIL Reddit loves frog.. super cute though
Fun fact: Frogs and toads don’t drink water they absorb it through their skin
That little wiggle after he got in the cap!
Cutest thing I've ever seen P. S.  You guys are nice to help a lil froggie
Wouldn't that be a... full body *croak*? Haha... I'll see myself out...
“Don’t worry froggie, I’ll keep you moist”
Aw little wet froge
We don't deserve frogs...
Imagine being stranded in the desert, and a gigantic hand stretches out of nowhere with a perfectly human-shaped ice cold full bathtub for you.
Its a frog sitting in a bottle cap cooling off! It’s so cute!!!
This is truly r/bettereveryloop
I like how he elegently submerges himself. I was expecting a good ole' belly smacker.
Froggies drink through their skin! So he DID take a drink!
240k upvotes?!? I've never seen anything like that holy fuck
u/stabbot
Cutest little green I’ve ever seen.
Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him. Way to go frog bro.
Is this the last day we can comment?
So cute
Hopefully that water wasn't chlorinated
Man, top post of all time!
Technically, he took you up on the offer. Amphibians absorb moisture the their skin instead of physically drinking water. His little scoot in the cap was him maximizing his surface area inside the water. Good job caring for the little guy!
I will always love this post.. it is really cute how it just trusted you

Well, they're yours now. Take good care of 'em.
This frog is so cute. The backyard looks heavenly too.
r/soakies
We've been getting a huge heat wave here too, +30's and above, which is crazy hot for where I live.  I never even thought of this but I should probably put large water bowls outside for various animals that may be desperate for water or a place to cool off.
Thank you for helping Frogger 🙂 This video is adorable.
I love how it starts off suspicious, then realizes that there's a nice little pool of water.
I don’t know why but all frogs have an Australian accent in my mind.
Any way this was in Texas? Because we were melting today.
I mean look at the size of the container you offered him! He obviously thought you were offering a bath.If someone pushed a bathtub full of water towards you would you think... oh, a drink?
If i fits, i sits

Butt wiggle and all.
I want everyone to use the term "froggo" IT'S SO CUTE >_<
Thank you for doing this!! Making the world a better place, one frog at a time :)
frogs skin is permeable to water, his wiggle squat was moistening and drinking though his skin.you did a good deed OP.
For an amphibian, full body soak is a drink. Good on you, kind sir
I think this is my favourite thing ever on Reddit to date!
Awwww that’s adorable
Frogs can drink through their skin so technically it is having a drink
Green boy doin an absorb
So wholesome. I love the way it looks at you like, "what? Really? That's mine? Nice....ahhhhhhhh, refreshing."
Should make a little rock pool in your garden area without pets. If you have frogs its a good sign that you probably have alot of creepy crawlies around that probably need water too. Pot bases are great with a few rocks in them and some fresh water. We do it for all our wildlife in summer! big and small!And i dont like frogs at all! But in the heat im happy to help anything in need!!!
Holy crap, this is currently the second highest voted post on r/aww of all time!
Frogs “drink” through their skin btw. So technically he’s drinking and bathing :D
Many types of frogs drink through their skin and not their mouth as one would think. That is probably why he/she went into the water, to get a drink. Google it. Still extremely adorable. Great post.
Boopity Boop, Bappity Bap, There's a Tree frog in my Bottle Cap. 💓
The heat here has been really intense as well and the poor jackdaws and crows are all panting and look miserable. We saw some grouped around a small, shallow puddle in the road, taking quick sips, so we bought some water on our ice cream run and poured it into their puddle for them.
Wow this became the top post of all time in just 9 hours!
This is very adorable. I truly do love frogs, they’re just so cute. However, I absolutely would have screamed, dropped the cap, and retreated quickly at the moment he looks up. They’re so unpredictable and that’s the one thing that terrifies me about frogs. Face leaping little shits.
Don’t amphibians “drink” through their skin though? Correct me if I’m wrong. Little dude very well may be getting a drink after all.
I wish I had the video still, but I ran into a similar situation in Queensland. This guy was just parked on the bench in like 34 degree heat, tilting his head towards the shower.https://imgur.com/xvJRySB
Interesting. A frog named Heat Index.
He was having a drink, frogs absorb water through their skin!
I mean what do you do when a giant offers your a pool of water?
That’s one of the most adorable things I’ve ever seen. Love.
I officially declare this is the highest upvote post I've ever seen.
who would turn down a free bath?
This now the top post in this sub.Stay cool, froggo.
Don't frogs actually drink through their skin?
Frogs drink by absorbing water through their skin so it did accept your drink of water offer.

frogs drink through their skin.
I think thats how they drink to be honest. The water gets absorbed into their skin and then they lick it off their face... i think.
And Congrats! It’s the top aww post of all time and it’s not even a day old!
Me when someone offers me just a little bit of attention
Love this.
i can't tell you how many times i see a pic or a gif here that i fall in love with and save, which is deleted by the time i want to show it to a friend.  please never delete this, and if you do, please send me the link to the OG. :)i love tree frogs so much (i have two RETFs) and i've been watching this off and on all day.  in fact, today was a pretty shitty day, and every time i needed a little lift, i looped this six or eight times.i cannot even deal with how adorable this is.
imagine getting one of the most upvoted posts in just a day. wow props to you OP.
Your cute science PSA: Frogs do not drink from their mouths like you do. Most absorb water and gasses directly through a thin layer of skin on their belly and pelvic region called the ‘drink patch.’ (I know because I'm a frog scientist)
How does it feel to have a Top 8 of all time post after only a day?
You should that that frog don't drink water like we do ( using mouth) , they absorb water by their skin using  gland called "drinking patch"...So ,in a reality he only accepted your cold drink respectfully
I understand. My wife and I often go far out of our way to help frogs, toads, and turtles. Won't anyone else think of them?
This is the highest upvoted r/aww post! Congrats!
I cannot stop watching this over and over!!  SO CUTE!!!!
My heart..
You should post this on r/awww. So cute
The way it just settles into the water. Ugh
you deserve a special place in heaven sir
holy crap this is now top post on reddit.
Great. He’s gay now.
Wuss Poppin here for the comment
Frogs absorb moisture through their skin rather than drinking it(as do a lot of other amphibians), so it was always going to be both a soak and a drink.
I'm gonna guess that frogs and most other amphibians absorb a lot of water through their skin.
“Could you take me to the nearest pond please?”
Make sure there's no chemicals in that waterCan't have him turning gay
He put his toes in the water, I guess you could say he toad the water...I'll leave now
Got confused for a couple seconds as to why u weren't on fire. G'day from Straya mate
43 Celsius for (almost) every other country in the world
He ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than he has in his entire life.
For the rest of the world, 110F is 43.3C
45 in real units
That’s a nice looking nail
awwww!
I'm impressed with the frog's ability to get into that crevice in the first place
This is so wholesome
Frog bro for the win!

Congrats on your new pet frog!
“Ah yes, yes, this is nice.”
You’re good people 🐸
This needs more upvotes
This legit made me go awwww
Maybe you’re here in Dallas. It’s been 110+ for too long. I want outta here.
People like you make the world a better place. :)
I learned in science class, frogs can stand *any* temperature so long as you slowly increase it over time.
and then the frog pounded 5 bud lights while waiting for mrs frog to come home & playing FIFA
Got that shiver in his little frog balls.
Wow, what a nice & thoughtful gesture! Thanks!
I want a frog now.
Happy frog good hooman
OMG this is just the cutest
Sweet fiddlers frog that’s cute
Awesome!
Been in Tokyo for the past week. Heat index has reached 100-high teens plus us walking EVERYWHERE. I wish I could jump in a cold pool like this little guy and it be socially acceptable.
I’m not sure why but this made me cry :’)
We get very large toads, small orange salamanders, ringneck snakes, garter snakes, and once even a good sized spotted salamander about 8 inches long on my property.  I see them all as beneficial against insects, and they are protected creatures in my yard.  Any specialists in small reptiles and amphibians out there that can tell me what I can do in my yard to help them thrive?
I was going to destroy the planet with nuclear fire until this video was uploaded to my mind. Maybe humans are worth saving after all. Good Human, you are a hero to your people. Rejoice!
Brb looking for frogs
Thank you.
It looks like he’s snuggling into the water to refresh himself. Thank you for being an animal bro!
/r/HumansBeingBros
I’d smash lowkey
"Okay Oscar, you know that thing we practiced 1000 times last week? The camera's rolling, this is your time to shine"
This is the single most adorable thing that I have ever seen.
You’re a good human.
I love how he just nestles! It's so cute!!
I am watching this over and over!
[deleted]
Are you keeping him?
I like when he/she gets in and pauses then hunkers down for a good soak. He/she totally trusted you or, perhaps said: “F-it. If you’re going end me, do it while I’m soaking my frog-leather self in this cool pool.”
I can't stop watching this.
God has made beautiful creatures. Both human and animals.
Bless your soul OP
Frogs drink through the pores in their skin so...
"wait, is that water?yeah, it's water... get in it...oh, that's nice...ohhh shiiiiiiitt, that's real nice."
I just imagine him in a British accent saying, "ahhhh that's the ticket"
Arizona summer is a bitch, but Arizona humans are goodbois. - Frog
Where does this frog/op live?
They can drink through their skin if I'm not mistaken. I may have just totally made that shit up....sounds legit tho.
I love how he takes a second to process the situation before saying "fuck it it's too hot, let me cool off in this hooman's water contraption."
a slimy boy is a happy boy. good work op
u/akiyamareno froggo !!
That's actually how they drink!
that's some Disney princess shit there
I love it!
If I fits I sits
I 110% approve this
aww that wiggle!
Very nice and caring of you to help the tree frog out on such a hot day
This is literally the best, it makes me so happy!
😭😭😭😭
His FrogLips must have been parched!
Lol reminds me of the time when I found a Frog in my Base Windows During a Illinois storm. Lol, that is a moment I will never forget.
This is the best thing I’ve seen. xoxo
you have a very kind soul
He nestled his little chin on your thumb, how sweet!
Respect
Amazing
Humans being bros
In his mind, you are a kind and merciful good.
If that frog fell would it die? Do frogs take fall damage?
r/humansbeingbros
AWWW YISS!!
I love you for helping him.
Well he is an amphibian. He needed a full soak. Your an awesome human for helping him.
Imagine being offered a swimming pool of water
Zen moment of the summer
FootloosePickleJuice, you're awesome.  I love it. Nice work.  You're cool (ing), too.
Growing up I would get lots of green tree frogs in the house.  I was always taught to thoroughly wash my hands, rinse all the soap off, and only pick up the frog (to take it outside) with clean, dripping wet hands
Bless you
ok i liv with u now
Would it surprise you if you knew that frogs “drink” through their skin?
He's so tiny that he fully submerged himself into a bottle cap full of water. It's crazy that the bugs he eats are almost the same size as him.
If I fits I sits
He closed his eyes!!
What a sweet gesture! Keep going man.
Now that's some high quality h2o
Poor think looks dry.  He very much appreciated the water.  Cutest thing I've seen in a long time.  Thank you!
Omg, it is sooo tiny
My little swimming pool !!🐸🐸
In this summer heat, it was crazy satisfying watching this froggy jump in that little cap of water. Gracias!
I got heaps of frogs around my place, sometimes they come in under the door and it becomes a race against time to catch them before the cat does. Love frogs.
Sweet buddy!!
Instant classic
"For me? Oh thank you! Oh my this is lovely!"
Moisture is the essence of wetness. Wetness is the essence of beauty.
Don’t they drink through their skin??
Fucking v.reddit man...shit doesn't work
What’s the difference between heat index and temperature?
Frogs are so cool and cute.
Bless you OP.
Best user name ever
Desperation is really bringing us together
I love the way he just settles in, and gets comfy!
You’re on your death bed and the doctor says there nothing he can do... In comes the frog grown the fuck.throws a wad of cash in the doctors face and says “ i don’t care what it cost ! .. make this human WELL!”  Life debt paid.
My nam is frogAm very smolHere come humanHe big and tolWat dis he bring?Some H2O?Why thank u humanFull body soak!

Dude amphibians drink through their skin
100k in 4 hours. Wonder what itll be at when i awake
You can lead a horse to water, but you must bring water to a frog🐸
:D
Funny story. Once when I was young a tree frog fell in the boat with me and my dad and he handed it to me. When I was done with it I threw it in the water and he was like “what the hell why would you do that?” I said “he’s a frog” he said “a TREE frog. Not a WATER frog” and I cried cause I thought I drowned a frog.
He’s probably drinking through the “drinking patch” located on the belly and and underside of their thighs. I learned this from Tuck Everlasting
Frogs drink thru their skin... ❤️🐸
r/HumansBeingBros
“Don’t mind if I do”
It is equally as dry here in the Netherlands. Got seperate waterbowls for hedgehogs, insects and cats and i love watching them being used!
That looks like it felt good. Good human
Fox, get this guy off me!
There's something special about the combination of a kind human and an appreciative frog. Didn't know that until now. But definitely special.
So cute! You should put a small dish of water or something out there for him.
What a cutie
Damn, you’re a real homie!
He’s totally smiling at the end <3
I didn't know I needed a frog in my life.
Frogs actually drink by absorbing water through their skin so he did, in fact, take up your offer.
From a frog lover, thank you for this
Don't worry, Froggy. I'll keep you moist.
How did you not keep him??? Omg soo cute
Well this just brightened up my day!
Poor guy
This is so kind ☺️ well done, op
This is a lot more polite than the time I caught a lethargic amphibian in the basement, took it outside while half asleep myself, and put it a little too enthusiastically in the nearby small pond. Tried to help, ended up water boarding. :(
Thank you for taking care for that little frog.
"Mjeh"
That often *is* how many reptiles drink, especially desert reptiles. Water on their body will be drawn to the edges of their mouth via the capillary effect.Think of if you put a paper towel upright in a glass of water. The water will travel up the towel, wetting the portion not in the glass.This be how some frogs and lizards do.
Definitely gonna need more frogs on this sub
Thank u/footloosepicklejuice friend of frogs
I thought it couldn't get any cuter
The part when he hunkers down 😍😭💖
That's how frogs drink
I love nature and wildlife so much. They always surprise you! He wasn't even scared, he knew you were there to help. What a cute little guy =)
That was very nice of you!!  anytime i see a frog or toad in the florida heat I always put them on the edge of the nearest puddle or supply of water because a lot of times they get too far away and bake.
181k upvotes! I never think I seen so many upvotes on a post.
The face of satisfaction
Thank you human, very cool
A lot of people say humans as a species should die out, as we are killers and haters, but I disagree.  This video shows what we are; the love we have inside us for everything around us.  If there is even just one person with compassion and the want to help others we have hope and we should survive.
Just realised that this post is the top post of all time. Congratulations OP
The world needs more people like you.
All hail hypto toad
OMG, the trust of that tiny creature!She's going to need a MUCH bigger bottle cap.
That wiggle as he settles into the water just killed me.
Thank you so much for saving that Kekistani warrior. Shadilay, brother!

Congrats on the new top post.
This post is going to be one of the top posts of reddit and i feel so happy because people can learn from it and do the same
I don't mean to be "that person" but frogs actually drink through a patch of their skin under their belly.
Holy shit. 10h old and already Top 2 of all time.
It's cute how the frog checked you out first and decided you are there to help! OMG. My heart can't handle it!
Frogs drink through their skin
Literally making history here. Almost top post of all time on Reddit!
207k+ upvotes and 5 gold and is still not enough for how much this little guy deserves.... and the guy who gave him the water too

Lol this is sooooooooooo *COOL* 🤣👌

The wife hangs these flower baskets on the outside lights at our house every summer. One year, while watering it, I see movement inside, and it turns out a frog decided to make it his/her home. So i cut out the bottom of a cup and filled it with water and placed it nicely inside. The next day, I come out to check on em, and low and behold, he is passed out inside the cup in the water. He stayed around for a good 3 or 4 months before he/she decided to move on.
The way they just shuffled down in the cap a little deeper than when they first got in and just started relaxing was just adorable.
This is the most upvoted thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit, great job!!
I have watched this so many times and I love it
this reminds me of how my dog goes straight for the kiddie pool at the dog park and ignores all the other dogs when its hot out
This post and these comments are so wholesome ☺
Don't they drink through their skin?
Stuff like this makes the struggle to stay vegan worth it.
That's adorable! Made my morning even better! Thank you sir!
Oh my gosh!  Thank you for saving his tiny life!
Great job, frog bro.My house is covered with tree frogs in Savannah.
This is hands down the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Good Karma right there.
Wet boi is super happy
congrats on top of all time on this sub dude!
Good thing you got to him before he croaked.
Did ya at least kiss it?  That one may be a prince.
RIP his inbox
Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?
I'm French and I like it
Frogs can drink through their skin you saved that dude.
Frog: "Aah! What are you doing?? Wait, is that cold wa- oh, hell yes it is! Okay, don't eat me, I'm getting in. Oh, boy, that is, oh, that's heaven. Yeah. I'm just gonna... settle on in here... rest my little head on your thumb a bit, and.... Yes. All is right in this place."
The new champion of r/aww!!!
That little wiggle after he sat in the water...
Your username kills me....was that a saying you used when you were younger?
Isn't that still a cold drink for amphibians?
Frogs actually drink through their skin! So thats how the little guy goes for a drink 😴
Amazing work there, chap.
I love this so much
how did that cute frog ended so high above the ground?
Congratulations sir you now have the highest upvoted post in this sub. *slow claps*
And just when you thought it couldn't get better,They actually drink with their butts.It's called a seat patch.
Hide a doggie bowl in the flowerbed and you’ll have a friend for life. Just make sure to refill the bowl periodically.
Hey I know him
That's a pretty funny sight! :)First a little bit hesitant, but then it's like... fuck it, too warm to be picky.Got job on helping this little buddy out!
You're a good person, OP.

Hey guys shouldn’t this be the 2nd most upvoted post of all time or am I missing something?
A frog never drinks from his own pool.
We have the same tree frogs around our house and this made me very happy💚
He's never been more thankful for anything!! lmaooo

You're a very good person.

I saw a huge toad once when I was like 5 years old sitting at a campfire with my dad. It looked at us and jumped into the fire and I was bawling.
You offered that frog *water*? Like from a toilet?
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day. Thank you.

Heat index? Is that what they're calling "temperature" where you live?
Awh little frogger boye took a bath.. so cute :’)
For non-Americans that is about 43 Celsius
Tfw celcius. Very cute dog there though
You. I like you.
I hope there aren't any chemicals in this water that turn the freaking frogs gay
Everytime I hit play on something marked as video when I'm in office bathroom, I'm afraid something will shout from the video and make me feel embarassed...

Frogs also drink with their entire body surface.
Froggie : “GET AWAY FROM ME!! Eh wait..let me just..ooh~ that’s just...oh yeah~”
Top post of all time.
That's the face kids make when they're peeing in the pool.
Aw, I'm sure the little fella will be eternally grateful to you for saving his life ☺️ My friends and family always make fun of me because I save bugs from drowning in the pool or I put them outside if they're in the house, but they're denizens of the Earth too, little though they may be!
Frogs do not drink like we do; they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. Ps I’m not smart I googled it
I think you may have found a froggo doggo.
This has got to be like 100 times worse than when a cat sits on your lap and you're not allowed to move anymore

Thanks I needed this video in my life <3
I love this. He turns around like, “this? for me?”
He owns you now. And he knows it too.
“Thanks man!”
Omg first time ive seen a frog do that so calmly and knowingly. It KNEW you were offering to help it, looked straight up at you and took a chance. This is honestly amazing. And good on you for taking the time out of your day to offer aid to a small critter, clearly it appreciated it. Aaaa this is just so adorable and amazing and ahdjfjkf always makes me wonder what is going through some animals’ heads, like especially for such a tiny frog which are normally skittish.Speaking of frogs, this just made me think of my own [frog story](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/90cn2u/full_story_in_comments_a_very_cold_tree_frog_i/?st=JJTG05I7&sh=e36dedee)

Good humans.
The little butt wiggle really made this even more adorable.
Adorable !!!!
What is "heat index"?EDIT:  "a quantity expressing the discomfort felt as a result of the combined effects of the temperature and humidity of the air."Google search.
Do you know what kind of tree frog he is? Hes really cute, you probably gave him such a comfy bath.
I love how he doubles down and almost goes “ahhhh yes yes this is perfect, thank you”
This is so pure.
So adorable! Both of you!
“I live here now. Get off my property.”
I love the his further nuzzle into the water!
That's cool as shit
If I remember my highschool Biology correctly, frogs die when their skin loses moisture.
Texas?
My mum always left a bowl of water out for frogs.
“ok human, now put me in some shade.”
Aww yiss
Love it!We had to get one of those animal bridges for frogs and ducks to get out of our in ground pool. We had a baby duck go for a cool off with mom and get stuck. Once we got him out we figured it was a good idea. It has also turned into the entrance/exit/sunspot for various lizards.
He seems too cute to not be poisonous.
When I was a kid my grandma put my pet frogs in the sun because they looked cold :(
Sitting like a prince on his throne.
Awwwwww. I get a shit ton of those frogs coming out of my unused pool each year. They’re sooo cute

My mom's boss was going through some personal problems and had to get rid of his dog. My mom said she would baby sit till he got everything in order. Mom had a car accident not long after and could not work anymore. Her boss moved to another state to take care of one of his kids. 5 years goes by and he comes into town for court with his ex wife. His dog went ape shit when she heard his voice. Dog was crying tears, barking like crazy, and running in circles around him.    We ended up baby sitting the dog for 12 years. She died at 18, but any time he came over, you could tell she was always his dog.

His dog went ape shit when she heard his voice. Dog was crying tears, barking like crazy, and running in circles around him.    We ended up baby sitting the dog for 12 years. She died at 18, but any time he came over, you could tell she was always his dog.

my girlfriend found a dog awhile back and tried to find an owner but no one called back to the signs. she didn't check for a chip because he was pretty haggard looking and she didn't have time to take him to the vet. fast forward to a few months later and she takes him into the vet for a check up and just as a joke checks for a chip and what do you know, he has one. perks up to his old name and she took him to his owner that night, her family was ecstatic and thought he was long gone. i miss that little dog but i am glad he's back with his original family.

TF did the thieves think was gonna happen once they had to bring the dog in?Edit: Apparently they didn't steal it; they bought it in front of a mall. In any case, they shouldn't have tried to keep it once they found out it had a proper owner.

They should have had a neutral person bring the dog in, and have each person just stand there and then see. Edit: Oh wow this was after 2 years. Definitely his dogEdit2: Just saw the video of the case and it was actually just 5 months. By the time they got on the show it was 6 or 7 months total

I love this! You can tell his owner really loved and took care of him the way the dog ran to him.
Judge Judy is a pretty cool dude.
I'm over here nearly crying over a Judge Judy clip. Damn.
And the wise judge spoke 'Cut the dog in half'
It's a good thing my dog is registered to me and I have proof that he's been mine since he was 8 weeks old.Because *he* really does do this with everybody.
Open and shut case, justice served!
L A W Y E R B O Y E
If there's any question why Judge Judy makes so much money - she's the shit
I will John Wick any fucker who tries to steal my dog
You can tell it's the *smell* that gets the recognition.
It's always incredibly sweet to see a big man loving his tiny prissy pup.
"He does that to everybody." Oh shut up.
how in the hell does judge judy look the same as she did 20 years ago!?
Never thought I'd see r/aww mixed withr/justiceserved
That warm the cockles, maybe even the sub-cockle region.

Someone tried to steal my puppy at the airport when I was 3 right before Christmas. The airport said he had arrived but he was missing and now they couldn't find him. He was only a few months old and a dalmatian in peak 101 dalmatian times so my dad suspected something was up. He wanted them to look harder, so he told ME, the exhausted 3 year old missing her dog, that someone had lost my puppy...right in front of customer service to intentionally make a scene.Anyway, he mysteriously turned up not long after I started screaming. He was found in a room he shouldn't have been in, back in a maze of offices. My parents swear someone was trying to take him for a Christmas present, but it ended with a happy reunion and 12 more years of walks <3
This is too pure for reddit

Yeah, when you start crying from holding a dog, it's your fuckin dog.
I remember an old man tried to steal our dog, despite him being collared. Luckily we were able to convince the man to give him back without getting the authorities involved.People who steal dogs are sick.
Congrats, you just made a 6'8" tall man cry happy tears.
Case solved, love that judge.
I love how sick of this shit Judy is."It's his dog. That's all, take the dog home"
Judge Judy is a G... My girlfriend bartends a few daytime shifts a week and always has Judy playing in the background. She's a mega fan. She even dressed up as her for Halloween. I wrote the production company and sent her a pic of my girlfriend in costume and she sent me back an autographed headshot written specifically to my gf. Gf cried. Judge Judy got me some serious cred. JUDY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.
"Court room"..."Judge Judy"Not what I was expecting.
Realistically the only fair way to settle such a dispute is by cutting the dog in half and letting them both have a piece.
Here, it was obvious to everyone the dog was his, but Judge Judy really does have an awesome BS detector. I both fear and love that woman.

Woman in court as dense as a logHer behavior likened to a hogShe tries to be coyand hide a good boyCause she purchased a stolen dog
Air bud irl.
I want to be clear that she didn't say "Would you pick him up." She said, "You can pick him up." She knows how much this dog loves him and how much he loves that dog. There was no hesitation of a doubt and I find that beautiful. And kudos for the guy for having restraint to not just lose it right there
Feels like this could also go well in /r/justiceporn.

"Listen to me carefully. Cut the dog in half.""Mmhmm. We both get part that way.""WHAT!? NO!! NOT FLUFFLES! Let her have him. As long as he's alive and happy.""It's his dog.""Oh he says that to everybody.""It's his dog."
I'm unreasonably angry after "he does that to everybody"And I'm like... biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I'm not crying, *you're* crying.
Background info:The lady had purchased the dog for $50 6 months ago with little suspicion as the "owner" wanted to get rid of it cause it was incompatible with their other dog.The actual owner found out about it 3 months later and request the return.The conflict comes from when the woman didn't believe (or didn't want to believe) that this was not her dog.TL:DR neither person was at fault and the real asshole was the one who stole the dog to sell for a quick buck causing both sides to feel emotional turmoil... supposedly.
I wish Judge Judy would run for president. I trust her.
"No your honor, you don't understand. This dog is a total slut! They'll accept pettings from anyone!"
And then you remember judge judy is fake af anyway
This is why you microchip your pets.
Lawyer- "do you see the defendant in the courtroom today?"Dog- *wags tail*
Your honor, I'd like to request a 20-minute recess for tummy rubs and scritches.
Judge Judy, for all the pageantry, is a badass. Good on her.
here's the episodehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG0a6Oy7rfAand here's the commentary he said/she said at the endhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g&t=1m49s
Sad story:When I was 9, my dog was stolen from my garage, a small terrier.Six months later, he was at my doorstep waiting for me.I was overjoyed. He was filthy, washed him, cut his hair, combed him all night and when I woke up, the side door was broken down again into the garage.My dog was stolen again.
This made me cry! Good call, Judge Judy. <3
Amazing that the Judge Judy serious stare directly translates to: youfuckingassholebitchareyououtofyourgoddamnedmindbringingthisfuckingbullshitgarbageinmyfuckingcourtoflaw Language fascinates me
"it's his dog." case dismissed immediately! LOL
That was so satisfying to watch. Judge Judy is the bomb.
"He does that to everybody."Lol! Funny, he didn't do that to every other person in the court room.
Take my children, fine. Take my dog, I'll kill myself
What did we do to deserve dogs?
You can't say dogs do that to everyone. Kidding me? That was a reaction of a dog seeing someone he knew and loves.
"He does that to everyone." Not exactly
I think that's the brother or some other close relative of my parents' moving guy. I had just taken the bar exam that morning and he told me about him appearing on that show to recover a stolen dog. Neat to see the video!
Lol it's kind of funny that a big black dude has a tiny little dog lol.
This is my biggest fear. I adopted my dog two years ago from the Humane Society and I am terrified one day we're going to be walking down the street and he's going to lose his shit seeing someone.
BRING OUT THE DANCING LOBSTERS!
Her face always screams "I'm sick of this shit."
https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g Here's the full case for anyone interested.
Case dismissed, bring in the dancing lobsters!
Bichons are the most loving breed. They get attached to a person very easily. He may have liked the lady, but it would have never been the same as his daddy.
My puppy greets me like this everyday, and only follows me.  Dogs know their true friends.
"That's him! He's the one who said I was best doggo!"
That woman felt the full force of the paw.
I just watched this episode this morning. Basically the Plaintiff (the guy who owns the dog) is suing the Defendant for stealing the dog, when the defendant claims she bought it for $50. So this happens.Wholesome case altogether
source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6gYeah that dog reacted that way after like 8 months away and you can hear the mom saying "don't. don't. don't." as she's putting the dog down.  They knew damn well that was his dog.   The mom tried to say she recently bought the dog, bs.
Yaaaaaas I love judge Judy. Also the moment when the dog and his owner make eye contact 😭
I gotta say, despite the fact that reality shows are scripted, and hers probably just as much, I think Judy Scheindlin is one of the best celebrities out there.She actually practiced law, she doesn't take bull (how she acts in the show is how she acts in real life, though maybe toned down a bit) and the show is meant to get people to do the right thing. She's someone people can actually look up to
Christ, I didn't see the k on the votes. I was wondering why a post with only 119 upvotes was on the front page XD
I love it when dogs are that happy. It's like they can't handle what it does to their body
[Judge Judy Dog](https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g) Kind of interesting to watch with sound and see what happens afterwards . I love the, "Thank you Judge Judy! You're not so mean after all" lol
"Court room"
When I was younger, my cat went missing. I was pretty upset and searched/put out signs but didn't find her. A few years later, my vet called - a lady brought in a cat she found as a stray (a few towns over) and my vet recognized my cat. The lady told me all about the adventures they had while waiting to find her "mom" and was happy to return her to me. I offered to work to pay her back the vet bills she had but she said no, it was enough that she found the owners and got to return her. I always thought that was the sweetest thing a person could do for a young kid. I was so happy to have my cat back. :)
I had one of my dogs stolen out of our front yard. Apparently this 20 something dumbass and his girlfriend decided to pick him up and tried to give it to his dad as a present. Thankfully, his dad was sensible and called the number on his collar to return the him. Not the first time either. A few years ago, someone stole my puppy out of our front yard too. People suck.
I went on a week long backpacking trip and they only thing I could think about was getting back to my dog. I had not even a foot in the door when my sweet boy ran over and jumped in my arms freaking out and super happy to see me. I was crying so hard because I was happy to see him. I really relate to this guy crying at holding his dog again.
This almost made me cry, i haven't cried since my little han got murdered .
"He does that to everybody" what a pathetic excuse 😂😂
Every morning Trump wants a binder full of things people like about him.Every morning I'd like a binder full of gifs like this, where good shit's happening to folks all over the daggun place.
I own this breed of dog. There's no way that dude isn't the dogs owner. These dogs are sweet and friendly, but they only act like that with 'their' person. My own husband doesn't get that kind of love from my dog. Even if she hadn't seen him in a really long time. These dogs are perfectly nice and love people, they'll let anyone pet them. (Even my girl who is scared of everything.) But this amount of excitement is reserved for that one person that they've adopted.
"He does that to everybody"He's not doing it to you, is he?
This is beautiful.
Judge Judy is awful but was right here.
The guy had snausages in his pocket.
Bring in the dancin' lobstas!
You are the father!!!Whoops wrong show
Link to the episode or section or video or whatever
My grandma's pomeranian legit does that to everybody - especially strangers, though.
I'M NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING.
[**VIDEO SOURCE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g#t=1m0s)--
How do we know the dog wouldn't do the same thing to the other person if they hadn't seen them in a while though?
"it's his dog" with her "you're a dumbass" face
My dog walker would win my dogs in court. I wouldn't stand a chance.
this is it , i'm getting a dog.
That's not his owner, that's his bff. His best fucking friend.
Of course its Judge Judy. "He do that to everybody!" Yeah right lady!

"Judgement for the plaintiff. Good boy."
This is very very sweet. My parents shitzu does the same thing to me. Numerous times my stepmom has brought her in a room full of people and she runs up to me. I was probably her owner in a previous life.
If the dog throws a fit, the judge can quit
How do we know he doesn't just want the cookie in that guy's pocket?
"Ma'am put the dog down"*Immediately lethal injects doggo*Case dismissed.
Fuck, I miss my dog.
That made my heart sing.
People who steal pets suck
Judge Judy deserves every penny of 95$ million contract.
I FUCKING LOVE JUDGE JUDY. FOR REAL THO
Thank you. This just made my day.
That's some Solomon level judging shit.
Case dismissed bring in the dancing lobsters
That lying broad should be put in jail. "He does that to everybody" my ass.
Ugh why am i crying
Damn, I was just watching the video on youtube. A pet knows when they're with their owner- you can't fake that bond.
[Here's the clip from the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g)...with sound and post-interviews.
If someone tried to steal my dog they wouldn't have made it to Judge Judy.
I feel like you just inherently *know* thats his dog, even just watching without sound. Its a gut feeling
[Video with sound](https://youtu.be/uxubDE2PQ6g)
Aww more like laww

Pardon me...I've got something in my eye.
Open and shut case Johnson!
The feels yo
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Nothing so pure as this love.
I wonder what that case was about?
Judge Judy's one weak spot is dogs lol. But she also has a keen eye for dogs. Some may be fooled, but Judge Judy isn't. She's a smart cookie!
I love that the judge bases who should get the pet based on how the pet is happy to see the owner, this is totally how it should always happen.  Seen a few other instances of this before too (think it was also Judge Judy). I guess that would work ok for dogs, but not cats, because cats DGAF. lol.
Best thing I've seen all day
"He does that to everybody"The dog hadn't ran to the audience members, though...
If someone was selling a dog outside of a mall for $40 I'd find that sketchy as hell. She should have known better.
I had to leave my doggo with family when I moved abroad. But every time I come to visit he ignores everyone else and zeroes in on me. Doggo doesn't forget, doggo loves forever.
Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxubDE2PQ6g sidenote: I've been watching judge judy cllips for like 45 minutes since seeing this what have you done to me.
I think this is my favorite gif ever
Some months ago I saw what she earns per year. I figured it would be like $5 or 10 million a year, but she gets [$47 million a season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Sheindlin). Not only that, she is the highest paid tv personality.
"He does that to everybody"-_She says, as the Dog runs to one specific person in the room filled with hundreds of people_
Take the dwaag
You mean stolen dog
Thats all take the dog home #owned
119k updoods
GODDAMN
Who the hell would lie about owning a dog to someone that was willing to spend thousands of dollars to go to court and get it back?
LOYALTY 💓
My mom eats this shit up. This one and the slightly younger, less mean female judge show. I don't get it. She's smarter than this.
Watched that on judge Judy YouTube yesterday . You can hear the defendant when jj says put the dog down telling her don’t
This is a straight up Pixar movie.
"He does that to everyone."Give me a break.Anyone that owns a dog knows the difference between a Good Boy greeting their owner, and a Good Boy playing with/asking for scratches from a random person, even if it's the most social Good Boy in the world. The tail wag is completely different. The whine is sadder (like they haven't seen you in a century, even though you just went to the cornerstore to get a carton of milk). They're way more jittery (like they snorted a line of coke). etc.That dude definitely owns that dog. 100%.
Cotdam! I just woke up, you can't make me cry like that already
I fucking love Judge Judy 😂
One of the greatest things I have ever seen on the internet.
"He does that to everybody"
Not even 24 hours and one of the most liked posts ever

Yay!!!!   Justice has been served...
The uproots are rising faster than the guardians of the front page
Anyone else find this super fake?
This is love..

What a piece of shit that women is. That guy cares more about his dog than most 5 year olds.
someone who steals someone's dog should be someone who no longer exists on this planet. Just pure evil.
Case dismissed. Bring in the dancin lobstas
Isn't this shit fake?
Yes, some dogs act excited around strangers.No dog, ever in the history of dogs has ever acted that way towards someone they didn't intimately know. As-in: A member of their pack.Dogs olfactory systems are the largest and most complex databases in nature. They can remember a person's scent decades after having seen them last. It is how they are able to find their way back to original homesteads after not being there for years. (They often do this when they sense they are dying.)Those women are thieving liars, and I hope they get eaten by bears.
"He does that to everybody" yeah, my ass.
I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that my dog gets ridiculously overexcited when friends and relatives visit, but is pretty chill greeting me when she doesn't see me for a few days. I'm old news.
Totally cried.
Is Judge Judy even real? I thought everything except sports (and even sometimes sports) are scripted.This is like Air Bud irl or something.
In the YouTube video you can hear the lady saying "don't, don't, don't" when judge Judy asks to put the dog down. What a scumbag.
That lady thief is poison.   A real piece of sh*t to stand in a court of law and lie like it was breathing.  Either mentally ill or just poison.  Do they fine the looser or put them in prison ?
yeah that is not a court room
Is this fake? A setup for the show? Or it really happened?Edit: Seriously, I am not familiar with this kind of show, and curiously asked a question. Was that offensive or so dumb that deserves downvotes?
Just like the script writers wrote it!
"lost"
The two women need to be slapped repeatedly for being so ignorant.
That's great the dog was returned safe!
This is the first time I have completely agreed w Judge Judy 100% and would of done exactly the same thing. Watch the YouTube link above to get more of the picture.
Judge Judy rocks!!!
Oh judge Judy. This must be the best episode of that entire show.Her net worth is over $300 MILLION.
If you want a dog there are so many who need a loving home. People who steal dogs are assholes. I know my dog and I would claw through hell to get to each other if we were kept apart. And that poor man was crying! Judge Judy thank you.
love judge judy for her bitchiness,   it's great.    She is a dog lover,   obviously.   The only thing in her pantry in NYC is dog food,   hilarious.   I just hate how she doesn't understand how to judge certain cases,    which is odd since she has the experience.   I noticed this in abuse cases and a few others --  she simply has never experienced it and doesn't understand that people rarely report abuse for various reasons.  Well known to most.   I realize she needs evidence,   and in this case saw it plainly....I think....but she is irrational and uninformed at times.   Still love her!

Judge Judy's the fuckin bomb.
Not to bust anyones balls in this, because it seems to me the guy really loves the dog, so I'm happy he gets it. But my moms dog will go apeshit the first 2 minutes of seeing me whenever I visit. Anyone she remotely recognize she will absolutely freak out over seeing. So it may just be that inital 2 minute spaz-out. Not that the dog doesn't love the guy, but if the roles were reversed and the guy had been with the dog all day and it hadn't seen the woman for a while, it might be just as happy to see her too.
What kind of terrible person would keep a dog from its owner
I mean this is cute and all but some dogs will do that to everyone.  I work at an animal shelter and we hold the strays from our county.  When a person come to claim a dog we require proof (vet records, pictures) and some people will say "just let the dog see me and you'll know it's mine."  That may be true but it's certainly not hardcore enough proof to send the dog home with that person.  People try to claim/steal small cute dogs a lot.
This reminds me of a r/thathappened post come to life: "the dog jumped out of her arms and ran to me.....everybody clapped"
you could show this in any country with no words, no sounds and every person would know exactly whats going on here.
That was awesome! Lol. That lady has some nerve.
I did not think it was possible to love Judge Judy even more.
What kind of sicko would steal someone's dog? It's cruel to the person and the dog. Just get your own dog, they practically give them away at shelters.
rrfgg QQ Xmas dgv
Gotta love meat-scented cologne. Jk, I fucking love that he got his dog back.
Step 1: Sell dog to Woman for $50 outside a mall.Step 2: Take buyer to TV court.Step 3: Repeat.
If you could hear it all, when Judge Judy tells the lady to put the dog down the defendant keeps telling  her not to. She knew..
I love that judge so damn much. She's not only a model judge but a model woman.
One of the fastest court session I ever seen
[Real Life Air Bud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HmuM48Cb8)
IM THE BOSS APPLESAUCE !
Was the case for the dog or did the dog just happen to be there? I assume it's for the dog, hopefully the man has his dog now.
"court room"
This is what it feels like when I pick my son up from his mom's house for my weeks.
Fuck those two women.  I hope they're infertile.
Judge Judy is a savage
Well I'm crying now
That's a wise Solomon sort of ruling.
Judge Judy aint no fool, clearly shes owned a dog once or twice.  Justice is served with kibble this day.
Nature for the win
Who the fuck are those people trying to say that's not his dog!?
I love Judge Judy
crying
Man tear
I teared up
Fake or not, this is awwww-some.
 I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying.
Awesome!
I thought this show was bullshit.
I know judge Judy is "scripted" but I'm glad that dude got his dog back. People who steal dogs are some of the worst scum known to man.
Judge Judy should be on the Supreme Court.
"That's all, take the dog home." -Judge Judy with the mic drop
My roommate has a dog and while she's 100% his, she's like 90% mine too. If that makes sense. She'd be happy if my roommate left and couldn't take her and I became her owner. But she's 100% his if we're both in the same room. Until she figures out the perfect spot so we can both pet her.
Judge Judy is the one celebrity I underestimated their net worth by the most, she makes so much from sick kids staying home and moms
I literally just watched this on YouTube. Creepy.
So cute
I had a pet cougar that greeted everyone the same.
Those are terrible f'n people. I am glad that man and his dog are reunited. 🐕♥️
Judy da BOSS
Are real cases presented in these shows? I've heard it's either fake, or people in show bring cases that they couldn't afford to go through real courts for.
Not gonna lie, this made me tear up 😢 so beautiful ♥️♥️♥️
This made me so happy I just can't even handle it
Judge judy is the shit. She doesnt fuck around with your bullshit
I'm sorry, "courtroom?"
I mean props for them for taking the legal course but if for some reason the court ruled in their favor I'd just steal my dog back.  No way in hell I'd take that lying down.
Plot twist - his pockets were full of treats.
Fuck those dog stealing birches Edit: Stupid autocorrect. BITCHES
JJ is a dog lover and she knew right away, she won't waste her time on BS
He wanted the cookie in his pocket.

Next time just call the Paw lice... I should end myself
I hate when I'm on the same side as judge Judy....
I feel really bad for that poor dog. Being stolen and sold. Good thing he is with his rightful owner now.
Love this! Fuck that lady
I'm glad judge Judy didn't "king Solomon" the dog.
I always liked judge Judy, even though she is a judge who makes money for berating people she tells it like it is. Also she doesn't tolerate people's bullshit and is extremely non biased...people may disagree but hell if I was her age I'd be like " that's a kind of woman I'd want to call me on my bullshit" and tells me when my shit stinks, literally and figuratively.
That's some Air Bud shit right there. RIP
This is easily my favorite thing on the internet. The joy that dog had of finding his long lost friend is infectious. And the short shot of the guy holding back tears.... C'mon!!
I have a question,  i dont watch television especially not American, are these types of shows authentic? Is that a real judge doing actual law cases? Or is it staged performance replicating real court cases?
I'm crying, people.
This is beautiful.
Omg this is so cute!
Didn't plan on crying again tonight... :')
Nice! I think I remember this one. Good to see an ending like this one.
Dog thieves are such horrible human beings wow
"court room" . . . tv set> retired Manhattan family court judge. The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claim disputes within a _simulated courtroom set_. All parties involved must sign contracts agreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin.While they do sign contracts for arbitration she isn't a judge anymore so her "rulings" aren't final say and anything she "rules" on is possible to be taken further in an actual court.
Real life Air Bud
There should be montages of the stupidest shit people say on Judge Judy.
I remember this case very clearly (defendant won't return dog she claimed she rescued because it's now part of her family, real owner sues to get dog back) and now I can re-watch / get good feels whenever I want. Thanks, OP.
God dammit, dogs are the best!!!
If someone stole my pet, we'd be in front of a criminal judge because I'd either beat the shit out of the them or kill them. Don't mess with my pets. That's like messing with someone's kids.
It's like Air Bud!
"Courtroom"
Its fake tv
Isn't this show staged? Or just dumb reenactments? I always assumed Judge Judy is a judge like Dr. Phil is a psychiatrist..I haven't owned cable in a decade. .
 I've watched this like 10 times already it's so good lol
Judge Judy is the law.
This dog looks so much like my dog that passed away last year...i miss her so much...what I wouldn't do to have her run at me like that again...
I'm not crying..... YOU'RE CRYING!!
Who's cutting onions this time of night?
Boy if anyone ever tries to steal my dog they won't make it to court.
Give him his bloody dog back you thief!
So precious, glad they got reunited.

I've never heard of anyone being able to fake that reaction from a dog. I don't know all dogs, of course.
3000th commentI'm happy that the dog is happy
What a cute little doggy! I love Judge Judy, she's wonderful!
Ah, thanks for being an animal lover judge Judy.
Wait, is this court TV stuff actually real? Haven't watched it in like 10 years
What episode is this?
Man this clip would be so much better if judge Judy didn't have a show and successful career
I'm not crying... my eyes are just leaking!
Awwwww
So cute
If someone tried to steal my dog I might be spending a few nights in jail because I would probably flip out on someone and pound their head in.
Good job! I'm so happy for that guy!
I'm digging the good moments we've been getting from Judge Judy content. But was it just me? I hated this lady when she was on TV. Is she still on TV? Anyways, she annoyed the hell out of me, just wondering if I was the only one.
I literally can't stop watching this. That dog is great. stopstealingdogs/10 Will crie again

"Take the dog home" queen Judy
Just watched this on YouTube and I just cried so hard.
This is awesome!
Sitting on the toilet, crying. Thanks Reddit. You always know just how to push my buttons.
Okay..  It made me cry
Awwwe that dude was so happy
I'm sold
This is my favorite Reddit video so far (this week). I get tears every time I watch.
I had that happen... Dog showed up at my apartment on the 4th of July. Walked right in and sat in the kitchen looking all sad.I got her on the porch and took her picture, put her on Craigslist.Guy emails me says "That's my dog!" So I go on the porch and call her by name, no response. OK, cool. I tell the guy "Look, you're welcome to come take a look, but don't get your hopes up because she's not answering to that name..."Dude doesn't have a car so he calls a buddy with this beat up old pickup truck.Now the whole time I'm sitting with her to make sure she doesn't run off and she's hanging her head like the world ended.Then she hears this guy's truck and goes RUNNING down the stairs jumping and barking.Yeah, man, that's your dog.
Why can't people just be honest? Do you really like a dog you barely know enough to lie to the owners face who you know LOVES that dog?  I can't imagine taking my new puppy and telling me that it now belongs to them and then have them lie about why puppy is sleeping on my foot? (it's weird but my puppy loves feet.)
Is there another time where judge Judy is any more fuckin awesome.
This belongs in r/landslidevictory if there is such a thing!
I watched this so much. I couldn't imagine someone trying to keep me away from my family member like that. Way to go J.J.
While watching Judge Judy was fun, it made me realize that no amount of education can benefit stupid people, and that they outnumber smart people 10,000 to 1.
Judge Judy is such a badass.
I had to punch a fucking wall to feel manly again﻿
In all fairness, dogs will do this to "everybody they know well". When my parents come visit, my dog goes nuts to see my dad. She goes equally nuts when either of my brothers comes visit.I am 100% certain under the same circumstances if they hadn't seen either of them in 2 years, and I walked her into a courtroom in the same fashion, she would immediately gravitate to them wanting to see them and lick them.Does that mean shes not my dog?
What kind of vile sack of shit steals someones dog.

That is the cutest thing in the history of this subreddit maybe ever.
*sniff* damn onion wielding ninjas...
Man, that makes me wanna cry,
I imagine he was reading a newspaper, he put it down temporarily, his glasses slid down the slope of his nose a bit so he could look you straight in the eye without a piece of glass in the way. He delivered the line, pushed his glasses back up, and then leaned back and continued reading the paper.
The fuck's that dog doing in a court room anyway? Only in America.
This is like that old story where pre presidential Abe Lincoln was a judge and was meant to decide who was the owner of a horse that was supposedly stolen and he did it by standing both of the involved parties on either end of a field and the idea was the horse would go to its owner so the horse ran to the guy and Abe Lincoln was like "it's his dog". Please tell me I'm not the only one that's heard that story ._.
Also that's not a courtroom.
My cats are like this.They go absolutely ape when then they see my wife and I and they couldn't give a fuck about anyone else.They escort me to my car every morning and meet me most nights on the street when I get home.*edit* words are hard.
Where are my testicles Summer?
This made me cry
The moment of recognition. Be still, my poor doggie heart!
And what weird sob story is this about the woman's mom being over sixty and having her first pet? She is young, she can pick up a good, loving dog from the shelter!
Not only is he the owner, he's probably a very good owner. Makes the dog so happy just to see him!
How sweet loves him toPieces
We never leave our dogs outside unattended. They are always on leashes or contained in the backyard. We have them microchipped as well just to be safe.
Never cried at a gif before. I am weak and pathetic
...And now I'm crying over Judge Judy
If this was a cat, it'd ignore you on purpose
First time I've cried watching a judge Judy clip
NOT A COURT ROOM!!!!
L O Y A L     B O Y E
The dog will surely recognize his owner. First is the owner's smell and then the owners voice.
Cute but so clearly staged.
...in "court room."
Love how the case is immediately settled after that.
My friend found a jack russell/chiuauau dog roaming the streets 6months ago. We put it all over the internet, lost and found groups but no owner came forward.  I have the dog now and it is like my 4th child. I feel bad for whoever lost their dog and it would be tough for me to give her up if anyone ever responded to the posts. Not sure what I would do. My kids love this dog too. Her name is Valentine brought her home on Valentine's day. http://imgur.com/2ZSzC1Y
dog teach you about loyalty and love
I don't know the context at all, and I think it's pretty clear the dog is his since he seems a lot more emotional about it than those girls. However my dogs both go ape shit like that every time they recognize someone as well. They more or less molest each of my friends when they visit.
Cut the dog in half!
The dog definitely belongs to the man!! Glad he got his baby back!!
This made me very happy 😊 don't steal other people's dogs ya hoe
TIL if I ever lose my dog I have to bring my fiancé to court with me because for some reason my dog hates me
What a charade.There's a lesson here - when something hits us in the feels - we forget to think.(not saying the dog isn't his - just that this is staged from beginning to end).
That's a man who loves his dog. Shit I'm at work and miss my dog now. 🐕
Judge Judy fucking rocks
Wish the dog had bit that woman
This is the most upvoted post i have ever seen
Can I please up-vote this twice
I can't believe I'm crying this much over a 10 seconds gif
judge judy takes no bullshit. love how she never hands out pussy passes.
Dogs do not lie!
I feel like she's done with everybody's bullshit and just already knows who would win the case
Titus Andromedon
You have to be a special breed of asshole to steal a dog or any other pet from someone.(Granted idk the exact context of the episode)
Aw, that man is so happy to get his doggy back. Big guys with little dogs make me feel warm and fuzzy.
This is why we need to chip our pets. So no one steals them from us.
And this was the day  The dog who knew 'sit' and 'stay'  Got to learn:  'Hearsay'
Incoming top reddit post of all time! The gif is a karma magnet of the gods.
That warmed my heart. My coworker is dealing with a rough (no pun intended) situation where he let a well reviewed and respected trainer take his dog and the trainer "lost" him. After finding some evidence including surveillance and multiple lies/stories not matching up he suspects the guy stole his dog, sold it or did something to it and is lying. Wish this was the outcome for my coworker instead.
So me and an ex girlfriend split up and she kept the Maltese I bought her. After about 2 months she couldn't take care of the dog as often so my mom and her would split custody. I couldn't since my new apartment doesn't allow dogs. I goto moms about once every other week and that dog loves my mother to death. Once I walk in the house though it forgets all about her and goes apeshit over me.Here's the kicker if my uncle visits (and he visits once a month) and I'm at moms the dog will go crazy for my uncle and forget about me. I'd bet if my uncle was in the courtroom and my ex who has spent way more time with the dog walked in the court the same situation would've happened.
If the dog sits, you must acquit
Stolen dog*
I truly can't think of anything I've seen on Reddit that I've loved more than this.
u/maxexodus look at this cute fucking shit
Hell yeah Judge Judy.
That's a true dog owner, you can see the love in his eye
Is someone in here cutting onions?
As someone who had the ex take my dog, I find this deeply satisfying.
"I'm taking the dog, dumbass"
Judge Judy is a boss
If you take my dog the last thing you will worry about is your defence in court.
Judge Judy is for sure an animal lover, she's great, she has a schticky show, but she always comes down on the side of animals. There was an episode of Pitbulls and Parolees where they'd had this very aggressive dog on premises, and they couldn't tame her, she still growled at the workers, and then one day someone claiming to be her owner calls up. They drive the dog to her yard, the *sec*ond this dog gets a whiff of her owner, she becomes a pile of mush and affection. Tia could pet her, she rolled over, she was completely different. Her owner used to be in a bad area where the dog had to be protective, she kept that mindset until she saw her owner again. Really incredible.
Can those women be put in front of a  firing squad for trying to steal this man's poor dog?
Best. Judge. Ever.
„He does that to everybody“ she says while in a room with 50 other people.
shoutout judge judy for handling that like a G
It's hard to stay sad after looking through the top posts of all time here.☺️
I’m not crying. You’re crying
Neighbour’s dog does that to my dad... Um...
People actually believe this shit is real ? Lmao so sad how stupid gullible people are.
[removed]
That looks so staged.
Its Judge Judy yo! Not a real court
Come on down to real fake judge shows!
You have to be a real piece of trash to steal someone's dog.
I'm on my period and my boyfriend of 8 months and I just broke up and i cried so hard. I should get a dog...
People who steal pets are the scum of the earth.
Why would you want to keep a dog the isn't yoursHmmmmm 😒🤔 Dogs are Loyal to their owners You hoe.
My ex-wife was just like this dog. Every time she saw another man she would jump in his lap and start humping him. Sure wish divorce court was that easy!
I see we're playing fast and loose with the term 'court room' today...
> recognizes his owner in court room* in a reality tv show
Both parties win in these Fake court shows.
Wow I'm impressed by a fake court room soap opera drama cuz it feeeeels sooooo reaaaal
Just to be wary guys, that show is pretty much usually always fake. My friend was an actor in an episode once, also on the Spanish one primer impacto, and also on maury if i remember correctly as well. They're all fake lol
[deleted]
I thought it was a real court at first.
Judge Judy for SCOTUS!
I feel like she'd make a decent president...
As someone who had to get the police involved to get my dog back, this legit brought tears to my eyes.
Bring in the dancing lobseters!
This post probably could have used a better title. I was under the impression as the gif started that someone was just bringing the dog in who was wandering around outside. Probably a better title "Stolen dog immediately recognizes his true owner in court room"
If the dog did that to everyone it would have ran to everyone.  It didn't.  It ran to one person.  I love this reunion.
This is a great reason to microchip your pets!  Scan the chip, identification number comes up, they check the I'd number with what's on file, and there you go all the information you should need.
next time she should take a cat. a cat couldn't care less lol
As amazing as this is, I'm a pedantic, so I must point out that Judge Judy's set is as much a courtroom as mayonnaise is a sexual lubricant.
That look of evil when he picked the dog up was starting.
Court room... Judge Judy. Oooookay.
Swift justice has been served once again by the formidable Judith Sheindlin. What a gal.
Isn't judge Judy the court themed Jerry Springer, aka this is staged? So easy to stage btw
I'd love to see a cat version of this, where it just doesn't give a shit
Can someone explain why people stating this is reality tv, and mosty staged, are getting down voted? Is that not the case? You can downvote me too, just please explain why.
Turns out he washed his face with Dog Food beforehand
So scripted
I don't understand how we as a society don't understand that shows such as this a scripted (nearly) to a T. Judge Judy, Bar Rehab, any "reality" TV show in existence really.
That's one happy dog!
What episode?
Omg this is making cry. I'm so glad he got his dog back.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
>Be me> steal dog>Owner knows I did it>refuse to return dog>brings me to court over it>bring the dog to court to show that I own it>put dog down>dog runs to previous owner>MFW judge says dog isn't minehttp://imgur.com/eoXl850

My dog gets really excited about random people too, it's something new and interesting.
Wow that made me cry. Can't imagine someone stealing a dog...
That sweet sweet justice

Wow those nintendogs obstacle courses were on point.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
She’s doggone proud of herself. As she should be.
My border collie just ate a cat turd out of the litter box.
Who else heard “boing, boing, boing...” in their head while watching this?
"It's me! It's me! Look, I'm doing so good!"
"I did it, moooom!"
Here is the full version of Kirk watching Kirk with sound.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzqH6TzDY&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzqH6TzDY&feature=youtu.be)

You really confused me when I read that as "former Border Collie"
Source video? I want to hear the dog!
Rewatching the tape like all pro athletes do. Respect.
What moron buys gold for gallowboob?
Can't dogs like, not see the picture on a TV? I'm guessing she's reacting to the sounds
Thanks for posting this. Made my morning. Such enthusiasm and unbridled joy. You go pupper.
How in sync she is at the start going from sitting to running is great. I picture her watching this daily for years to come like Uncle Rico.
GallowBoob strikes again, harvesting that karma...
Reliving the dream!
Congratulations lil Kirk you did so well!
"OH BOY THATS ME THATS ME THATS ME-"
THIS IS AMAZING
Gif is down. Mirror?
>Kirk>FemaleWtf
Staggers me that she can keep up with the editing and cuts the same way we can.
Kanye West watching a Kanye West video..
THAT IS SOOOOO CUTE!!!!!
Anyone have a link to a mirror of this? Looks like it was taken down.
I hope she got collieflowers as her prize.
This was cool, and then I saw it’s just another u/gallowboob repost lmao
Holy crap. At first glance, I thought this was a post directed towards me!
Boarder collie expert gallowboob
fast dogg
This is so freaking cute
huh! from the doggo's I've ever owned, they all seem to treat the TV as a bright, loud box and had little capacity to see shapes on the screen.
*"Go me, Go me Go me"*
This is me when I watch my own Snapchat stories over and over.
Reminds me of Nintendogs!
Do you think she realizes that is her?
Captain Kirk! :>D
 These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.
r/GifsThatEndTooSoon.
This is border-line adorable. Also always a great idea to study tape for next time
They say the dogs don't recognize themselves in the mirror (or on TV?) but having had a border collie that was smarter than some people I have met, I disagree.  My dog's been gone over 25 years and I still miss her every day.
Why name a girl Kirk?
This is awesome
"That's me! *bounce* *bounce* That's me!"
Border collies are so damn smart
Great job on the pups part!!! Maybe purina should put as much effort as this dog to try and improve their subpar product. Anything made by purina is pure dog shit...and that's BEFORE the digestion!!!
She’s amazing
That’s adorable, she looks so proud of herself! Very aww worthy
Border collies and aussies are damn near the same. That jumping is exactly what my dog does
I was pumped for her.
What an egotist
How do people train dogs to do this?
Gotta watch tape if you wanna improve.
whatever happened to u/GallowPlaceholder ?
Reliving her triumphs! So cute.
"GO ME, GO ME, GO ME"
this needs sound!
You can see her getting all amped up. Ready to run through the fucking wall if the handler told her to.
I bet that dog doesn't eat Purina.
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.

When I first meet Buddy the poor guy could barely walk/waddle without getting out of breathe. He hated the leash and refused to leave his owner’s side so I had to carry him down the street and force him to walk back. Now he loves his daily walks and can even run.  So proud of Buddy! Edit 1: Thank you for the reddit gold and all the kind words!!!!Y’all are too kind! Edit 2: The before and after is after 6 months of walking. He gets walked around the block every day. He was a rescue but we think he is a 10 yo chihuahua mix. Also I swear he is happy! He just looks grumpy!

Edit 1: Thank you for the reddit gold and all the kind words!!!!Y’all are too kind! Edit 2: The before and after is after 6 months of walking. He gets walked around the block every day. He was a rescue but we think he is a 10 yo chihuahua mix. Also I swear he is happy! He just looks grumpy!

I think you did a wonderful thing and I'm certain you've enriched his life and his mental health and that both he and the old lady you help love you dearly for it. The photos make me laugh though because in the second one, his squint makes he look like he is glaring into your soul with resentment. It's like he's thinking *'I was happy before you. Fat and happy. I stayed indoors where it was warm and my lily white feet knew only the soft embrace of the finest Persian rugs. But then . . . you came. Now I am ripped daily from my happy home and with my ever shrinking body I feel the bite of autumn's cold teeth. My feet are dirtied, dirtied by the harsh tap tap tap on concrete and the decaying bodies of once green leaves. As green and full of the warm sun's promise as my past was. One day I'll make you'll see. One day.'*

The photos make me laugh though because in the second one, his squint makes he look like he is glaring into your soul with resentment. It's like he's thinking *'I was happy before you. Fat and happy. I stayed indoors where it was warm and my lily white feet knew only the soft embrace of the finest Persian rugs. But then . . . you came. Now I am ripped daily from my happy home and with my ever shrinking body I feel the bite of autumn's cold teeth. My feet are dirtied, dirtied by the harsh tap tap tap on concrete and the decaying bodies of once green leaves. As green and full of the warm sun's promise as my past was. One day I'll make you'll see. One day.'*

In the first pic he looks timid but now he has that smug ass look on his face like "yea, I look good." Too cute!!! You are a nice person!
Is there a sub for doggo progress pics?

From the look on his face, Buddy doesn't look enthused about his new fitness regimen.
If you cut his nails, he will have a lot more of an easier time to be active and stay active. He will also feel a lot more comfortable in general.
That’s awesome! Your neighbor might also consider feeding Buddy less, which will help him stay at a healthy weight.

I love this so much. Thank you.
Shameless plug here but I am in Atlantic Canada and volunteer for an organization called Elderdog. They pair seniors who have dogs with volunteers who walk them and play with them. I walk 2, sometimes 3, gorgeous dogs for a senior. If you live in At.Can, or even if you don't, look into organisations near you who may also do this. It's so rewarding and keeps seniors with their dogs longer.
Buddy has made some great dogress!
🎶 My Buddy and me! 🎶
In the first picture he looks self conscious and in the second one he looks all smug like ay I know I look good beeee
T H I C C  B O Y E
You are good people.
You rock! You are literally adding years back to Buddy’s life!
This has so many layers of sweetness.
How long do you walk him for? Did you have to gradually increase distance?
This is too awesome! You’re a great person!
He looks like he’s sick of your shit
That is awesome of you to help both of them!
That was very kind of you and I'm sure they both appreciate it a lot. Nice work
Holy shit how far did you walk him??
Good human does goodboy a help! Yesss.
Fat animals make me sad.Good work on giving him exercise!
How long do you walk him for? So cute
That’s so awesome man, glad to see upstanding people doing nice stuff sometimes. :)
He looks like he hates you
You are a really good person, OP! Thank you for caring for Buddy and also helping out your neighbor when she needed it! I hope you get lots of puppy kisses from Buddy!
I would like to see more posts like this.
and now they have a friend when the other one dies^^^apply ^^^that ^^^which ^^^ever ^^^way ^^^you ^^^like
This is more awesome than some of the success stories on /r/loseit. And much cuter.
Good boi gettin’ gains.
Bless him and bless you.
Damn that dog is thicc
This is so touching and inspiring. Thinking about doing the same thing for my niece's Guinea pig.
Way to go! You’re making a big difference in both of their lives, thank you!
Where's the picture of the comically oversized, former collar?
He needs a pair of sunnies
:)
You are so pure
This is the most wholesome and good deed I've seen on here. Good job! And congrats little pup!
This is prime /r/HumansBeingBros content right here.
Holy crap in a hat. That was one round doggo. Good job
That's so awesome!  I'm proud of Buddy and you! <3
[deleted]
That’s super awesome and kind-hearted of you to do!! You rock!!! Congrats on getting healthy Buddy!
Wow what a contrast between the two photos!Thanks for being a kind human.
I can only imagine your weight loss is just as good!When we set a goal, it's not the finish line, but what happens on the way there that has the most impact in our lives.  Great job!!!
This is so sweet. Applause for your selflessness.
This world needs more people to act like this
* Pic 1: "Do I really have to move for this 'walk'?"* Pic 2: "Oh my god, Karen if I have to take one more step..."
Why he looked pissed about the weight loss
YEEEY THANK TOU MAN ALL DOGS SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU
You deserve your impending gold, OP.
Good for you man :) I walk my friend's dog too, wish I had space for a doggo
Good for you.  Excellent results!
Aaaaaawwwwwwww. Happy pupper
He also changed from a dog to an opossum
This is the cutest thing!
I’m really touched by this. Thank you ❤️ Shine on
“What have you done to meeee!!!?!!!” Eyes right there
Wholesome
You are an awesome person. Please have lots of kids.
Based Buddy
Great post but I am laughing at the face on the dog now that he is in better shape and going on walks. He does. It look thrilled!!
He looks like he fucking hates you
Now he has kind of a badass look on his face too.
He looks pissed in the right photo
You are an awesome human being!
What's cuter than doggo? Healthy doggo!
That must have been one hell of a walk!
Thanks for being good hooman to buddy and your neighbor. <3
💝🐕
You are a good person.
Yaaay!
awesome work! he looks great
He looks like he hates you
Awww thank you for enriching this pups life and helping a senior!! ❤️
poor thing looks so old, thank you for doing such a thing ❤️
Thank you! For being a good neighbor and doing what needed to be done. That pup is their BF. How's the 90 yr old doing. I love older people.
Bro buddy fuckin hates your ass

he resents you so hard for it too, that is some vicious stink-eye

Fat pets like that break my heart. That is abuse!
The sad thing is that this is a form abuse even though unintentional due to the elderly owner not being able to walk, but there needs to be volunteer services for those animals.  If the elderly owner can't take care of himself then how the hell are they going to take care of a dog or cat if they can't even get out of the front door.  The sad thing is if the animal is taken away, the elderly owner will most be heartbroken since the dog or cat is their only companionship.
I'm glad you did it but honestly, the owner is to blame regardless of her age. She could have had someone all these years walk her dog.
Before Pic: "Get the fuck away with that leash.  I'm not going.  I hate you."After Pic: "You're still a dick... but thanks for saving my life."
Go Buddy and OP!!
Loyal dog

2nd pic.  Little buddy is up to something. He's shifty.
I fucking love you for this OP
Go buddy go!
A simple act that seem nothing but has and will impact many (me included). Good karma will come to you.
Now we just gotta get people to do this
Thank you so much for helping this dog out. You make a huge diffrerence on his quality of life.
Probably saved this dog’s life!
Can you walk me?
Left: Sad little balloon!Right: Begrudingly admitting that maybe this walking thing is good for him.
His facial expression is priceless. "Y u do dis. But thx."
Proof that working out doesn't boost a dog's mood
He don't seem too proud to be slim. Must be crashing from all that cross fit bull shit
Alternative Title: Old lady commits animal abuse.
Good Hooman
You are a wonderful human!
What’s with old people and naming their dogs buddy? My great grandma had a dog named buddy
Cute little nugget!
You are a good person.
How is that the same dog
Buddy now has a jawline and resting bitch face
Lol. Looks healthier... And pissed!  I speak from experience, I exercised once - it was awful.
Buddy does not look amused.
Lol he looks absolutely miserable
And I hope you have added light to the neighbor's life.  My 84-year-old grandmother lost her dog it hurt her real bad. She missed having something around to talk to.

Let's no get out of perspective that the Dog Owner is 90 years old. It's not his fault he can't walk his buddy. :(
Nice
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
Hey can you help me next?
Good job OP in helping the dog out. You probably saved its life.Having said that, it actually really annoys me when old people insist on continuing to own dogs, when they clearly aren't able to look after them properly. Failing to have a dog walked is failing as a dog owner. Also that little dog was morbidly obese, which again indicates that the 90 year old owner was completely failing in their duty.I appreciate that old people can get lonely, and want company in the form of a pet, but this situation was still unacceptable. My advice to such dog owners, is to either get help if they're struggling, or consider being owned by a cat. Either way, they need to take responsibility, or not own a pet at all. /rant
People really shouldn't get pets when they're so old. It's not fair on the pets when they die and they get neglected in certain ways like this ): I'm happy you've helped her out like this though ! So kind
This warms my heart.
could be a sign of dementia or even alzheimers. my grandmother came to live with me and she kept over feeding my dog because he would beg for food and she could not remember he had already eaten. thankfully my little guy likes to chase other dogs along the fence so he ran the extra food off.
Jesus that poor dog thank you for helping him
That's animal abuse. If you can't take care of your pet, give it away.
You are awesome, your neighbor is a dog abuser. Just feeding him less would also make him not morbidly obese. I get being super old sucks, but this is animal cruelty.
Looks like a dog that barks at everyone and everything
That's animal cruelty. If you can't care for an animal, find a new home for it, where it can be much happier. "Years" is more than enough time to hire a dog walker.
Can you walk me, please? Thanks.
You are beautiful soul!
This blatantly looks like a meme.
In awe at the size of this lad.
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.
Dat face says I kill u I kill so dead

This is the sweetest! You’re an awesome human.
Awesome.   I'm sure you guys bonded as well.
Wholesome
You’re an awesome person, doing this for both your neighbor and for Buddy.
You're a good neighbor.
looking like an absolute unit on the left
It looks like a fat carry image photoshopped with a dog's head.
**from fluffo to buffo**
whyd you do it
Good hooman.
This made my day!!
You’re a great person for doing this! Thank you for helping that mutt out and increasing its quality of life.
Omg ur the best!! What a happy lil chi!
I'm sure he is happy to be outside but his better years are behind him inside of the house.
God bless you
Bet he is loving it too! Good for you, that's very kind of you.
You have given Buddy so many more years!! Hopefully he will live at least as long as your neighbor... by the time people get that old they end up losing people, pets etc all the time. Hopefully this is one less loss they will have to experience!!
Steph didn’t strike out this time. Steph hit a home run.
You gave them both a gift. The dog gets weight loss, and the owner gets to keep her dog longer.
You are so awesome helping out your senior neighbor and Buddy!
Thank you for being a good person ❤️
I started walking my 2 older chihuahuas with my new lab and they are looking really fit too! We're all getting in better shape. But I wish I'd taken a before and after of all of us first!
You're the best kind of neighbor, one who cares.
He's got a whole new leash on life!
Absolute unit
He still thicc tho! 👌🏻
You're a good human. Thank you.
Absolute unit
You are the best hoooman in the world!
this is so pure. the content I need in my cynical existence
God bless you my dude
Sounds like a good deal!The dog gets walked and becomes healthier, and you get a dog to go outside with and start conversations.
Love the expression on the after picture. Before: I'm fat, but I'm fine.After: I fuckin' hate you Bob.
I used to walk my exes dog daily who is a corgi. Recently saw said dog and just about cried on how much weight she gained. Good on you OP for giving this pup some exercise!
r/progresspics
The only thing bigger than the poor puppy at the beginning is your heart ❤️ , well done you.
SO PROUD OF YOU AND BUDDY <3 <3 <3
Awww good on you. He looks so much better 😀
He looks high as hell in the second photo..
Youre a great person
The dog kind of looks like it resents you for it.
He went from potato to hot dog! If you keep it up he will reach noodle tier!
I wish I could be that good of an human being. Nice job op ❤️
r/humansbeingbros r/mademesmile
Well done,  OP. Fucking well done.
Love
Probably the best before/after comparison I ever saw
This is awesome
I’m certain he’s happy but that look on the second panel is like he’s judging you. “I used to have a nice life lounging around....”
That's so nice of you. He looks happier too.
That's very sweet of you, you are a kind person! Buddy looks great!
Major Karma points for you my friend.
You are a hero :)
You probably gave both of them more years together!
That is amazing! Good job, Buddy.
Awwwww!!!!
Looking good Buddy.
Everyone needs someone and it's so very cool to see that you were there for someone who needed it.
You absolutely beautiful human being.
What an incredibly kind thing for you to do for both the neighbor and the dog! ❤️
Great job!!
I might need you to start taking me for walks.
AWW! Give pls give him a cuddle for me 😍
Thank you for taking great care of this good boy!
Who a good human
You are a hero!
That's so kind of you!!
I've done that. Lots of elderly people in this neighborhood so I've walked their dogs.One pair of dogs I walked for three years. Really sad when they moved away. And now no one walks those dogs.
Delivered pizza for a living. Can confirm a lot of old people have an overweight pupper to greet you at the door.
He looks more miserable..
All good things considered, the after image looks like hes seriously gotten sick of your shit.
Sweet of you to help out.
Yeah, he looks thrilled.
Poor old lady and doggo. His mommy doesn't have the strength to walk him
Well done! You have a generous heart, to do this for Buddy and your neighbor.
You know she added you to her will ......your getting the dog <3
He looks pissed about it. “God damn, picking me up and taking me from my house can’t believe this shi- I’m out OF BREATH MELANIE OK”
Congrats to you and the dog. Looks like you both have had quite the transformations lately!
Buddy looks like a real chick magnet :)
well done! Other people may see it and turn a blind eye to it but you chose not to ignore it. My dad was 86 years old and he had neighbors who always looked out for him and it really give me peace of mind that they did I didn't live very far away and neither did my sister's so we were there often but we knew when we couldn't make it like an inclement weather that he could count on them to help him maybe shovel his driveway or you know just things like that for him and it made all the difference in the world
Can you take me for walks too, i need to lose weight 😂😂😂
Good lad. He's looking in great shape. Can't believe just how round he was before.
You ROCK!
He’s not your buddy, pal.
\>that expression in the second picture  You know he knows he's better and healthier, but he doesnt' like it and want you to know it

Ok... I hate snakes and that's the cutest damn thing I've ever seen. Bonus cute points for naming a snake Spaghetti.
My noodles name is Spaghetti too! She's a girl though, and she doesn't have a sweater
So cute, too bad sweaters don’t work on snakes ;) 🐍
I hate snakes but this is so cute I can’t believe it.
Science question: Do sweaters keep sneks warm? Since they’re cold blooded, do they generate enough heat (or any, but they must generate some heat I think...) to be warmed by a sweater?
Lookssss like he apresssssssiatessss the nissssse insssssulation.
Spaghetti’s stomach muscles might not be able to get traction with his new sweater. So he may be in full “Well, I guess this is my life now,” mode haha.
If snakes had hair, this is how I imagine it would look like
Dude, she just made the arm part.
i think /r/snakes would appreciate this
Would a sweater work for cold blooded animals? Would it be any warmer?
my nem is snekn wen it’s cold christmas will comeso ive been toldI luv my mumshe get me gifts da fam does tooour spirits lifts my blood is coldmy heart is notI gets a giftI luvs a lot is made of yarn I crawl inside christmas is nice this I decide
The best time to wear a snake sweater... is all the time!
Normally snakes scare the shit out of me but it's so hard to be afraid of a lil guy named spaghetti with big sparkling eyes wearing a sweater his aunt made himIt's the end of the world. I love this little guy. Give spaghetti a kiss on the head for me.
How did you get it on him?
Idk how you got that on him, I feel like if I tried to put a sweater on my corn snake she wouldn’t be too happy about it lol.
Who needs spag bol when you have the spag boi?
🚫👞🐍
I want my name to be spaghetti
Omg
Can he still slither?
What kind of death noodle is that?
Literally a danger noodle with the right name.
You have a meme snek
But where are the arm holes?!
Read that as "Made a sweater from spaghetti" Surprised but not disappointed
I think Lowly Worm had a sweater like that.
background on snake?
I loathe snakes. But I ❤️seeing this snek in its sweater.
Was it a total surprise? Did she contact you ahead of time and ask how long Sketti is? Or did she come over with a tape measure and you ask "what are you doing with mah snek?" And she said, "oh nothing..."I have a pretty bad fear of snakes. I'm working on it though. Your sweet baby is awfully cute in that sweater.
Aww. Not aww, but a snake shat on me once while I was holding it. Sprayed bile-looking stuff and bits of bones all over me. Perhaps the sweater can double as a diaper?
There’s a children’s book (it’s very old and maybe out of print) called Crictor. It’s about a boa constrictor whose owner knits him a sweater to wear just like this! It was one of my favorite books as a little girl and my daughter now loves it too :) Such a cute snake and sweater
Good Snek.
Idk what’s better...a snake named Spaghetti or a sweater made for a snake ❤️
Nah not at all lol. It's more of a tube for him to just park in, it doesn't really effect him all that much, he slithers right out of it when he's bored
Many of my family members were slaughtered by this beast, do not trust snek!
If snakes are cold blooded. Is the sweater actually providing any utility for spaghetti? Isn’t the whole point of sweaters to trap body heat radiated form a persons own body?
Hey everyone!I wanted to thank you so much for sending Spaghetti some love for Christmas, I can't believe how much this thing blew up. I ended up doing an interview with The Dodo this morning. Completely blew my mind. Thanks again, it's really been a fun ride.Here is a link to the interview if anyone wanted some backstory on Spaghetti and his sweater!https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/pet-corn-snake-gets-christmas-sweater
*You named the snake Spaghetti*  *You named him after spaghetti*  Aww
I don't even like snakes but this is adorable.
What type of snek is this?
How does the snake move without sliding right out of the sweater?
Danger noodle has a danger sock now.
I don’t know what I love more; the fact that the snake is wearing a sweater or the fact that his name is Spaghetti.
Long ass rice
Turtlesnek
He looks happy.
That is the best name for a snake I ever did hear.
Are snakes able to recognize people?
I just thought about if there is any poisonous snake similar to yours and comes in front of you, how would you know which one is yours?
I wanted a bunny rabbit, I was gonna name it Nathan... that's Latin for 'warm' by the way... Nathan Scott Phillips..
Came here expecting Eminem lyrics. Was moderately dissapointed
You get an upvote just for naming your snake “Spaghetti”
Seems like your corn snek evolved into a 'carpet' snek :)
It’s pronounced Ssssssspaghetti, right?
What kind of snake is spaghetti?
That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Your sister is awesome!
Are pet snakes affectionate or are they just like "You're cool" to their owners?
I hate snakes.Can I hug it?
The real question though... is it a scarf a sweater or a onesie?
Snek sock

whoathe video of this is #9 trending on youtube right now.i don't think i've seen an actual interesting minute-long video from a real-life person on the trending section in like 5 years. it's always filled with late night tv show host garbage, 25 minute vlogs by 30 year olds that are marketed to children, and an occasional rap video.Come with me and be awed by this.
So not a turtleneck?
He just crawls out of it on his own. It's not stuck to him (no arms to hold it on!)
Cute and eleguant
Does it... Is a turtleneck sweater?
Spaghetti is literally the best name for a snake ever. I don’t like snakes but a snake named spaghetti makes me wish I had a snake and named it spaghetti.
" I enjoy this, human"
I guess he likes to slytherin...i will see myself out.
[deleted]
Upvote for the name spaghetti really!
Why is he so damn straight? I thought snakes, like, slithered...
I am sad that I can't see anymore pics of that cutie (yet, I am split between cuteness and "eeww snakes", more pics would help the cute side in me to win)
"I can't move my arms!"

The best part is that Spaghetti may be the best name for a snake ever

For some reason I read this as my sister made a sweater out of spaghetti
Now Spaghetti needs a light layer of cheese.
A sweater won't do anything for a cold blooded animal. The only reason clothes make you warm is because you produce heat and the clothing traps that heat.
His tail is sweaty, scales weak, charms are heavy.There's vomit on his sweater already, his name is spaghetti.
Kevin Durant looks cute in this
Aren't snakes coldblooded?
I'm drunk rn so I'll be that one guy. Snakes don't really 'love' anything. They're next to mindless and only care about food, a place to hide and temperature regulation. They're pretty much neutral to everything else. My rosy boa acts like I'm nothing more than an object it's way.
theres snek in his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti
What a noodle
spaghetti = danger noodle
*On today’s episode of Does Reddit Like Snakes...*Who knows what the answer will be tomorrow
Spaghetti looks more like a cannelloni now
hey sneke you got beautiful scales. Why you want to cover them.
awww i luv sneks <3
[deleted]
There's sweater on his spaghetti already.
/u/Rancor_Emperor post this in r/snek
Good boy, Spaghetti!
This reminded me of [Lowly Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowly_Worm) from the books of my childhood.  Though for some reason I though Lowly Worm was a snake as a kid I guess.
[ Same tailor?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/everythingbusytown/images/c/c2/Lowly-worm.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20100517002240)

Can Spaghetti move whilst wearing the adorable sweater? haha
Legit thought you meant for spaghetti noodles. Awesome snake with an even cooler name.
Psssssssghet-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-ti is the sound he would make if he was a Pokémon.
Do snakes actually show affection?
Spaghetti is a great name. Almost as good as my friend's python named Trouser.
Baby it’s cold outsssside
This is exactly what I picture as what happens when someone yells "Ridikkulus" at a snake-shaped boggart
Imagine the phone call between OP and their sister.Sister: *Hey how long is your pet snake?*OP: *uuuhhhh, 28 inches, why?*Sister: *No reason*
Sorry to be 'that guy', but snakes are cold-blooded and thus do not produce their own body heat. Sweaters are made to insulate and keep body heat from escaping through the air. Since snakes do not do this in the first place, the sweater is probably a hopeless cause for reptilian comfort. Actually, the guy would probably be much happier under a warm lamp.But it's the thought that counts, right?
"I knew I could pull off a *turtle*neck."
I’m going to annoy everyone with this knowledge thank you.
"Oh... wow a sweater. Terrific. Just... What a gift. Thank you. This will keep me warm, you know, because of all that *warm blood* in my fucking body."
Rest in Spaghetti, never forgetti.
I need science! For a Warm blooded animal it would help keep body heat in. Does the sweater do anything for the snake, who doesn't generate body heat?
He's mom's spaghetti. <3
Might be cause I am drunk but I picture you're snake screaming in a vegeta tone," women where is my fuzzy snake suit".
His palms are sweaty
I’m terrified of snakes, but even I have to say this is totally adorable lol spaghetti. that is a really cute name for a snake.
That is the most perfect name for a snake.
Danger noodle
Am I the only one who thought of a sweater for eating spaghetti?
I Isssss happy and warmsssss
Looks more like a № 13 linguine to me...
DOES HE HAS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT?
Does your sister have any children? I would like to think some kid out there gets to say “mom’s spaghetti” when talking about the snake.
My mom crochets draft snakes to block the cold coming inside. I'm gonna have to step extra high over that draft snake next time I visit, because I'll remember this picture. I hate snakes, but congratulations on a comfortable-seeming snake who I assume is very nice.
https://imgur.com/a/G4VyW
A bit too inconspicuous. What if someone step on snek?
What a cute little sweater
Can spaghetti move in that sweater?
Oh my God so cute!!!!
On the surface he looks calm and sweaty
I showed my husband the photo after reading the captions to him and his first question is "who is Spaghetti?" And then his second question "who does Spaghetti belong to?" He had no other reaction.  Priorities.
Best. Thing. Ever. Right out of The Far Side.
his name should be spaghetto.
Yo I'm high as fuck am I seeing this shit right now?
r/titlegore
It's so cute!
I am terrified of snakes and will now look forward to the many nightmares I am about to endure! Thank you!
serious question: how do sweaters affect snakes? like, does it keep them warm? or will it cause them to overheat in any way?
Hey what are you knitting there? A sweater for my snake. What does it look like?But seriously would you consider making a video of Spaghetti putting on the sweater?And posting it of course!
Finally... a scaly friend makes it to the front page on this subreddit :~)
Reminds me of a double reed on a bassoon or oboe.
I don't like serpents, but Spags here looks like a good boy.
Ugh! Again with people posting snakes that are kind of adorable. I have a phobia, stop confusing me!
As someone who hates snakes, I can't believe how absolutely adorable this is.
What is that? A turtleneck?
It looks so cute !!!
When your snake rocking a knit like that it ain't a "Spaghetti" it's a "**Swag**hetti"
Fuzzy danger noodle!
Came for the sweater of spaghetti.  Left disappointed.
Spaghetti. Thats fucking awesome
Vacuum your floors once in a while holy moly
Possibly the best name ever for a snake
It's a tube top!
Could she add more rows to make it longer, to cover his tail end? This is adorable 🐍
I’d like to see the video of her putting him in that.
r/sneks gave me a whole new perspective on snakesI use to see them as just creepy, but that sub showed me that they can have the personality of a puppy!
I love the name Spaghetti for a pet snake!
This is why I come to reddit
I love the name
A cute snake with a cute name and a cute sweater? Can I visit your family please? :D
don't thread on me!
I like the sssssssssssssweater.
Danger noodle
That's probably the best name for a snake I've ever heard
Spaghetti needs to be an internet sensation!!!!!
I would do anything for you, Spaghetti
How will you know when he wants to come out and fed up of it?
Omg his name is Spaghetti. I love that❤️❤️
More like a boa constricted amirite?
Time to vacuum
hate to break it to you, but unless that sweater has active heating, then the only benefit that snake will see is not losing any heat to the flooring and looking cute AF.
For a second I thought "who the fuck names their snake Spaghetti?", then I looked at his face. Spaghetti looks comfy.
I like that his name is Spaghetti
This may be the only time a snake has been adorable. But instinct is telling me it’s a trap.
Your name, is The Enforcer.I want my name to be Spaghetti.
Hate to be that guy, but sweaters don't work on cold blooded animals. Sweaters just keep your body heat in, they dont produce heat themselves
[deleted]
What kind of dog *is* that?
The most adorable danger noodle/snek I've ever seen. The sweater/knit tube makes it even cuter.
I think he's fine with winnie the pooh'n it.
Nagini thanks you
Reminds me of a Richard Scarry book.
Are insulating garments helpful for keeping cold-blooded animals warm? Just wondering. Not trying to diminish your sister's thoughtful gift.
no step on snek!

"What happened to the magical force  field that used to be here?"
Fuck yes, this gif was worth 187 MB on a 2M connection
At the end he's touching it like "what the fuck is this witchcraft?"
180mb gif? Really?
We did this once to our glass table but instead of jumping on the table, he ran full force into the glass that was leaning up against the wall.  The "Thunk" he made was incredible.
Logitech Z5500?
Still graceful AF
It almost looks like she had a sense of humor about it. This is really cute.Edit: She, not he.
I was incredibly confused by this at first...I have almost an identical desk, with an almost identical sub in the corner, with the same weight under the right side, with similar carpet under, and used to have that same keyboard.  If it wasn't for the wall color (which I really, really like by the way) and the cat (also adorable--I have two, but thankfully they aren't doppelgangers as well) I would have thought that I was looking at my own downstairs.
I have this desk!!! The glass is so scratched and ugly after 3 years. I windex and windex and all I can think of are all the scratches. My cats fear it
I wish I had a cat.I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.:(
I'd love to know what they're thinking...
It really amuses me to think that many animals must think they're levitating when they lay on glass. To them, the world is full of invisible walls that can disappear and reappear at any time.
"ah, yes. Everything is ok.  I meant to do this." *rubs*
Swear to god everyone in the world has this desk
He's probably going crazy and contemplating his entire life thus far
/r/catpranks
Cats are strange and amazing creatures. One of mine is obsessed with the fish tank so much so I count the fish every morning make sure she didn't get one lol. Several times a day she will do a paw check just to make sure the glass is still there, because hey, who knows? Water might be holding itself in place this time.
This should be on r/nonononoyes
I did not expect it to jump up! That was awesome.
I have the same desk.
Me trying to score
I wish I recovered like that
your cat made my day bearable, thank u
/r/youseeingthisshit
What you don't realize is the cat knew that the glass was gone.  The cat was simply testing you to see if you understood its perception of reality.  Cats are always right.  Just realize, now, that when you put the glass top back on, the cat will jump *through* the glass.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son?
Hey what’s going on here?
She can be silly sometimes.
I’d score that dive a perfect 10.
I know y'all rich fuckers with 100MB/s, but could we have gifs that do not weigh 187MB pls?
Cat handled that jump like a fucking champion. That's a magical creature right there.
188 MB for a 20 second gif? Fucker!
Yo, I have that same desk. I love that desk. I did very similar thing cleaning it when I went to set down a smoothie , and it went right through.

I have that keyboard. Logitech g15?
Can someone add cat calculations to this?
I want to see the cat's reaction when the glass top is put back on.
We have the same desk.  And keyboard.. and speakers. What the hell, are you me?
16.83  There's your trouble, homan person, the part that goes here is missing.
cat goes straight to smelling as if that's going to identify the problem lol
I feel like you can see a part of the cat's brain going HANG ON SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT before the jump but not managing to convince the rest of it to stop.
It's kinda frustrating that I'll never be able to convey to that cat what's happening and it'll never know
This cat is the Richard Feynman of cats, using her paw to create a model of the natural world for future reference (the no table where there is clear was a table not now theory of tables) and predictions. Of course scent marking the "phenomenon" with the side of her face and whiskers in case formal model fails at some point in the future.
At least it was a 10/10 jump.
You know how when you're going down the stairs and you think there's one less step than there is and for a split second you think "this is how I die"? Times that by a hundred and I bet that's what that cat just went through.
I once spilled drinking water over my bed I had to take the mattress outside for drying.Came back to find my cat staring at an empty bed frame with devastating look, like it’s the end of the world for her.
"What sourcery is this???"

" I'm stupid fuckin cat & I don't know shit" 🎵
Cat.exe malfunctioning
I needed this laugh.
More important is the update when you put glass back on. Will he or wont he have the same level of confidence?
Dude! I have the same desk and my cat also almost looks like yours!!!
This has made my day. Thank you.
Haha this reminded me of my dog but much less graceful. My dog just kinda flopped over and it took him 4 tries before he realized something was wrong.
/r/BetterEveryLoop
Just watched this on a continuous loop, he jumps so perfectly into the table.
Lol...that is too funny. Poor baby..
Oh my. I just about peed my pants from laughing so hysterically. But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed with guilt for laughing at the poor helpless and confused feline! The wife and I always talk about our West Highland Terrier being a creature of habit. Well, I think the same applies here. Thanks for the video. I pray the cat recovers soon.
“I can’t touch the table! I went right though it! Am I a ghost?!”
Another Z-5500 in the wild! Best audio purchase of my life until I finally upgraded to a large system.
**BOOING!** -- *Oh. what...*
At least it was a graceful leap
''My whole life was a lie.''- Cat
That's a good lookin desk ya got there. Looks just like the one I bought not too long ago lol
No no no, you see... I totally did this on purpose!
I have the same desk works well, lmao your cat, classic.
I'm going to go home and try this on my kitten, thank you for brightening up a long day.
Does anyone know what breed this is? My older cat passed away had this exact fur pattern and everything. Would love to look up pics of the breed.
Marvelous.  Did not stop its curiosity.  Delightful cat.
I have the same desk, but not the same cat.
Will someone that knows how to edit video please show us what it would look like if the cat passed through the magical desk plane and came out on the other end as something else?
"Oh no, I'm a ghost!"
Cat acts all casual... “I’m just doing hurdles”.
Seriously love watching animals figure stuff out.
Nice party/circus trick
Kudos to you for keeping your desk so clean that the cat couldn't tell the glass was gone.
Hahaha
Bless it.😂😂😂
“Removed the glass huh? Fuck it I’ll just fuck up this suction cup!”
I have that same desk! Put a LED strip around the upper black frame and it looks pretty cool.
Heh... I have that desk. I absolutely hate it.
Damn. I guess we vastly overestimate their intelligence. Lovely.
lol..... he acts all casual like he planned it that way............
I have this desk! It sucks!
I have that same desk, and carpet... and wall color with white trimming. My brain glitched for a second
Hey I have the same desk. Time to fuck with my cat!
I like how he played it off..lol
this made me legit LOL
Note to op: When cleaning top of desk, turn desk into ring of fire for cat to jump in
To show solidarity with the cat, place coffee cup on the invisible table🤔🙂
such a fucking idiot
Hey, what happened to the force field that's usually here?
Nailed that jump though
Stuck the Landing thoi !
Ah, is that a z5500 sub I spot there?I have two sets. Probably gonna sell one. Bought it from a guy used for $140 lol. Practically a steal if you ask me. I was running two subs using a cable I got from eBay. You learn to appreciate just how powerful that sub is after running two in unison and being overwhelmed lol.
#Cat logic:*maybe if I paw at, or rub my body on it, it'll go back to normal*
I have the same desk!!Edit: did your desk come with a cat? Mine didn't =(
Wow this looks exactly like my cat of 16 years who passed away last March. Miss ya Flip...
I wish I recovered like that
“What to heck?”
awwww!!!!
Does not *cat*pute
Cats always win
I have that same desk. I do not like it.
🎵 This cat is pretty confused.Table top needed cleaning so its  removed. 🎶

The best birthday surprises are the ones you don't expect. Once I remember punching in at work and the machine playing happy birthday. It was just a machine but it somehow meant a lot to me in that moment.

After all those “Oh gawd, mum no” birthday cake surprises, I’m glad to see one that’s more me.My childhood was awful, I never actually got to celebrate my birthday, closest was one time where they wanted to take pics for family members, so they decked the table with food and made me sit prettily. No birthday party, even today at 28.If someone would surprise me with a birthday party or even a cake, I honestly think I would cry.EDIT:Wrote this right before going to bed, and waking up to this was, well, I cried in the bathroom. From kind messages to offers for proper mothering, it’s all amazing, and somewhat overwhelming. I’m not exactly used to anyone paying me any mind, and now I’m crying again.I will reply to everyone who messaged me, but for the moment I’ll say this:Because I live in The Netherlands, and nowhere near many of you, I won’t be able to take you up on your offer for a party or being my DJ. In this case however, the thought most definitely counts. Thank you very much.

Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN
This made me so emotional.
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.
She still has the childlike wonder.
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.
That’s all it takes. Minimal effort. It takes minimal effort to be kind and nice to people. Remember that next time you’re out and about.
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!
Selfish question: the woman in this video reminds me so much of my ex-girlfriends mother. We’ve been broken up for nearly 2 years— but I’ve never forgotten the love and support her mother gave me. Absolutely wonderful woman— but no desire to get back together with her daughter. Would it be a weird move to send my ex-girlfriend’s mother a letter, just thanking her for everything she did for me? I feel guilty I never properly expressed my gratitude at the time— but don’t want her to be weirded out by some random card from her daughters old boyfriend.
This lady looks like she would bake the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.
And you just know they wouldn’t have bothered if she wasn’t someone that they really liked. Someone that really deserved a sweet surprise.
Waitresses never kiss me on the cheek.
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.
Props to the waitress, what a genuinely warm hug and peck on the cheek, bless her heart too. Back when my dad was still living, and in an assisted living facility, I would see him and his elderly floor mates very often.Nothing made them light up more than a young person spending time with them, the younger the better.And if you brought a baby, we’ll forget about it, plan on spending the whole day because you will see the sheer joy that a baby will bring to this generation that raised a lot of us.If you’re a teenager reading OP’s post with a smile. Say hello to someone this darling woman’s age, help them with their groceries, or pay for their coffee. More often than not, you won’t be disappointed. Your heart will swell like the Grinch’s when he clapped eyes on little CindyLoo Who.Here’s hoping this woman has many more birthdays and each are filled with this much joy, if not more.
Can all things on the internet be things like this please
Looks like they dropped a heavy gift bag on her too.
When we get older, we don't put as much value on our birthdays. It's easy to just let them pass by with minimal fuss when we're adults. But something like this, this little reminder that it is an important day, especially to just a casual acquaintance, is incredibly nice and meaningful.
Oh my god she seems like an absolute sweetheart, she's the sorta customer I miss from working customer service.
This is so precious, and her husband is wearing a checkered shirt too!She seems a really, really lovely person. :)
That makes me cry. That's more than I got on my birthday. It's nice to be noticed and feel wanted.
The amount of feels I’m having right now...
I want to just give her a squeeze! Her face is just pure joy and appreciation.
This looks irish
I am a cold, bitter, broken old man and even I liked this one.
I LOVE THIS!!!!
These are the types of people that make working at a restaurant totally worth it! Happy birthday to this sweet soul who is obviously so deeply cared for!
She’s perfect for the old guy from UP
Just got off the phone with my mom wishing her a happy birthday. After seeing this I would have given a lot to do this same thing for my mom
Can we talk about how they match?
What a beautiful moment!
This brings tears to my eyes. My grandmother and I had a diner we would get breakfast at almost everyday. Once she became weaker we went less and less. Everyone at the restaurant knew us by name and had our order in before we even sat down, we truly felt like family. She would write personal cards and get gifts for every staff member on their birthdays and holidays. Everyone loved her and would come out of the kitchen to give hugs and kisses. She passed away a year ago. This brings me so many good memories about her thank you.
You’re going to make me cry.
Wow really nice!  Small gesture but it goes so far!
Man I wish there was a subreddit for happy old people
I work in a hospital ER and the other day and one of our patients came in on his 97th birthday. He had no nobody with him.The catering service sent up a little chocolate cake and all the nurses came into his room and sung him happy birthday. He was so happy he was crying.
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady’s day.
/r/eyebleach
AwwwHappy birthday!
u/commonvanilla Do you know this woman? She looks very much like my mother and has very similar mannerisms.
Oh my god she’s so cute! 10/10, would hug
I need a hug like that rn.
The way she looked at them after she gave her a hug and put her face in her hands was so endearing. Props to that staff!
I fucking love how appreciative people are. This is some good shit, fuck yea it’s good to see this
What gentle soul! A ball of positive energy, an most of all, a destroyer of cakes and baked goods
Can I hug her?
so precious
Awwwww the rest of the world, listen up. Be this. Please. I hate not having this everywhere. We would all live in heaven just for a little bit if we could do this
Brb melting
I bet she makes amazing cookies
Sure, the granny is adorable. But she looks like a Grade-A certified Badass with her collar popped like that. Like she could go full John Wick on you if your not careful
OP here after a sound night’s sleep (no school, no sleep deprivation tonight). I can’t believe what a beautiful response this has gotten. This video I brightened my entire weekend after a stressful week and I’m overjoyed to see so many people liking it too. Reading through all the nice comments directed to this video and to the other commenters...it’s such a change from normal reddit.For some who have asked, no it isn’t me. This is a video I found off Instagram that was too beautiful not to share.
That is a woman that does not get appreciated enough in her daily life.
This makes me want to hug my mom.
People like this made waiting tables almost worth it.
Tickled pink!
Meanwhile in other threads little spoiled shits are like "ugh! I can't believe someone would do that to me!"
i miss my nana
I need a hug from this sweet lady.
 I react this way every time I’m given cake, even if I’m buying it for myself
She looks like such a genuine person.
she deserves so much more than free cake ♡
Delightful!!
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen
So cute! So much happy! I love it. She’s so appreciative.
I haven't recieved a birthday gift since I was like 14 years old. I'd probably react that way to free birthday cake too!
 Haven’t had cake in my bday in over 10 years. I’m a 35 year old man, I think I would even get a little teary eyed.
This seriously brought a tear to my eye. So sweet.
I don't know this lady but I love her so much.
awwe. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years as a server/busser. This elderly couple always came in at 1pm. God I loved them. One day the wife didn’t come. She had passed away. :( my boss let me take the day off. Sometimes when you’re working at restaurants you really look forward to seeing your regulars.
That made her year. This is awesome. This comment will get buried but I don’t care. This video is amazing.
Give her everything!
So precious!
I’d love to run a little cafe just so I can make these kinds of friendships
I literally feel unworthy of watching her pureness she is downright an angel
I love her already..
her reaction is priceless <3
I audibly whispered aww.. my friend heard, was interested, and ultimately awwgreed
Omg she’s the cutest. I want to be friends with her. PS. I’m a 26 year old guy.
I wish I grow old like her many decades after and people around are still as kind
Old people are cuter than babies, don't @ me
I want to give that woman a hug
Awww Happy Birthday!! We all love you and you’re adorable!!
Sweet, reminds me of my angel mother. My mother deserves her life story to be published in the Library of Congress archives. And all of love I can give her.  Love you mom!
Old people are awesome.
SHE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED
What a joy to be loved.
I thought puppies were the cutest thing in the world. I was mistaken.
That's awesome
I’ve watched one hundred times.
I want to hug her so bad :,)
best thing ive seen all day :)
I had the exact same reaction just watching it. How sweet 😊
I just got goosebumps, so much amazing!
Please reverse it.
As a server, this made me tear up.
She's so damn wholesome I wanna give her a hugg
She is a little cinnamon roll♡
This video gave me goosebumps for some reason. This lady is beyond adorable
Oh my god that was adorable.
this warms my heart
This place looks like a nice place to eat
You can just tell she is a humble person!
What a lovely gesture and reaction!!
I’ve noticed how older women are so much more appreciative of the little things...
And now I'm crying.
Fuck all the niceties, I hope they have some freaky birthday sex.
This is so sweet
Waitress was going in for the lips for a second there
Well shit i cried within the 8 seconds
This is what life's all about.
Man I gotta call my grandma
Sweet!
What a nice lady
So sweet
This is great to see! Maybe one of the first times I’ve see someone truly appreciate this gesture.
Sooooo cuuute!
That is so nice! Great job!
Cherish every moment.
:)
Lovin' the best of humanity!
This made her day I bet!!!! RAK!!!
I would give her all the presents and cake!
Oh why is there never a mirror bot when I need it?
She reminds me of a scene in The Office where Tobey’s little girl asks Phyllis if she’s mother goose!! That scene was adorable!
This is exactly what I needed while studying for 4 exams :D

Pretty sure that's cannibalism.

How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy?
How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy?
Found him on @dash.dog
It’s a dog eats dog world out there.
Go Mariners!
Safeco!!
Go M’s
Being a Mariners' fan this season sure is ruff.
Hot dawg he did it!
Did he get to eat it afterwards? He nailed being adorable, he deserves compensation!
Your good boy dresses better than I do
Safeco Field
Well hot dog

can dogs eat mustard?
There's a grate-type barrier behind the dog on the frontpage GIF and there isn't on this one. Looks like the same dog, bandana, and hat but might be a different game.
LITERALLY THE PPST BELOW THIS ONE IS THE VIDEO OF THE PHOTO BEING TAKEN LOL
Lol, I saw a vid of this being taken. Glad to see it worked out!
When a Reddit fan captures a Reddit fan taking pictures for Reddit!!!
[deleted]
He is a super star! He is smiling ear to ear and does not appear to mind his human dressing him up! Such a lovable face. Give him a belly rub from Karen in pennsylvania!
If you go on r/eyebleach there is a video of this guy taking this photo
I SAW THE VID WHAT A GOODBOY!!
AYE GUYSI FOUND EM
This is too many levels of meta
I swear a video of you taking this picture was just on my homepage.
So meta
How many hot dogs were harmed in the making of this photo?
The final product is just as good as the behind the scenes.
Awww! I just saw a video of this good boy trying not to eat the hot dog!
Does this count as r/tworedditorsonecup ??
This is right above the video of the guy watching you get the shot in my feed :)
 I saw these literally right next to each other
Meta.
I thought it was a Muppet at first.LOL!
HE DID IT!!!!!
How do you train or prepare a dog to not be afraid of all the lights/sounds/people?  I have a boxer pup that loves people and other animals. I would love to take him to a baseball game, however I took him to the beach and he was afraid the whole time, tail between the leg, didn't want to say hi to anyone - totally not like himself. I'm worried he would be the same at a baseball game.
The internet is an amazing thing.
I swear I saw the video of this being taken somewhere else on here.
R/aww doggin it
Inspired me to make hot dogs for dinner 10/10 would do again
How much did the M's lose by?
Don’t get much better than a ball game with your best friend.
Someone give this dog a brand deal!
Selfie dicipline att its finest
Im sure the woofer wouldn't be as happy if he knew the name of what was in his mouth.
As unhealthy that is, I would really like to see goodboy to eat his prize. Some closure for little people :P
Definitely better than I was expecting!!!! 10/10
Boop
You know this dog is too much like a human
lol. He started eating that hot dog 2 seconds after this was taken.
Cutest Baseball Boy Ever!!
My good boy is wicked smaht
Go Mariners!
I saw you making this photo
Oh yeah, love that dog on dog action
Alright. I need a Golden Retriever. Now.
Awwww
H A W T  D O G G O
GOOD BOYYYYYYY
u have completed the circle thank you
The follow up we needed
“Good slave got my karma. 666/666.”
SO FERKIN GOOD
Saw the video earlier and was hoping that the guy was a Redditor. So glad he is because this picture is too freaking cute!!
MY HEART IS EXPLODING FROM ALL THE HAPPY
I was waiting for this since this morning!
Who needs a kiss cam when you've got a good boy cam?
Yo someone else got you in a video of you making this!
Is this that dog from an earlier reddit post when he was trying to get the photo?
I have sat in this section.  For a girl scout night.  We were the lucky recipients of the very top row.  This is an annual event and we had top row seats two years running.
Maybe it's just the uploaded picture but I didn't like the background focus and quality found it distracted from a good shot.  Did some quick edits to add a bit of lens blur to background and some slight balancing to reduce the highlights.https://i.imgur.com/KNK8Ufd.jpg

I saw a video posted here with someone filming you take this lolGood boy doing his best to pose with food at the ballpark https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9djyde/good_boy_doing_his_best_to_pose_with_food_at_the/?st=JLRL0AIR&sh=5eaf04a1
SOMEONE POSTED A VIDEO OF THIS PERSON TAKING A PIC OF HIS DOG AND PUT IT ON THE SAME SUBREDDIT...REDDIT-SEPTION
He's rocking that handkerchief.  12/10
The photo is cute but I can see from the behind the scenes video that your dog is overweight. Feeding him bread, cheese, sugar (in the sauce), and overfeeding are all bad for him. Especially since this breed characteristically overeats if they can. Please look after your pup by keeping him healthier.
You sound suspiciously like a dog, OP.
All American pup.
Meta.
HOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
https://imgur.com/gallery/9Cnme3V
Hot dog! We have a wiener!
...are you going to eat that?
"me want hot dog...hurrreeeey!"
The closure. Feels good.
I've seen him before🤔🤔
Is that ketchup on that hot dog?!
That picture was almost worth the $10 hot dog.
10/10? That seems kinda low
God damnit Doug, my nose looks huge.

Ahh... Cannibalism!
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9djyde/good_boy_doing_his_best_to_pose_with_food_at_the/?st=JLR288PU&sh=96967f19The video 😱
So cute. Cant believe the dog can just do that naturally. Real talent!
Hot Dog!
I was waiting on this to hit the front page after seeing the vid
You da real MPV, I was dying to see the actual photo!
Best photo on the internet right now paws down
The video is so good
A ROOBY ROOBY ROOOOOOOO!!!!!!
DOG eats Hot DOG. A little strange......
PHOTO DOG!!
I needed this closure
I was at the game. This pup dominated the big screen!
Link to original?
Amazing
Oh my god I was so sad that I couldn’t see the finished product!
How does this dog have more willpower than I do?
Cognitive dissonance at its finest
Should make this my tinder picture lmao
Someone took a video of you taking this photo and upload it to Reddit
Where did the fence go?
Knew this was Safeco immediately. I might need a hobby that isn't baseball.
wait, isn't this the video?
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there
Awwwwww
I get that reference
I saw I video of you taking the picture
If you look at the gif, then the picture, they are two different dogs... and sadly two different hot dogs :(
Did you let him eat it?
I wonder what the convo was like between the owner of the dog and the other guy who was recording him take the picture. He probably made the front page and told him to post it.
omggg all that hard work was worth it!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/9djypy/good_boy_trying_his_hardest_to_pose_with_food_at/?utm_source=reddit-android
Is this Safeco Field? Looks like my home stadium!
Worth the hassle in the video!
casually scrolled down front page and saw another person's post of you taking this picture of your good boye hahahha
Let that good boy eat his dog now
Feed the damn dog lol https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/9djypy/good_boy_trying_his_hardest_to_pose_with_food_at/?st=JLR5SVOC&sh=af669e64
Good boye has earned his upvote

I saw a video of someone recording this guy taking this picture today... 🤯
I really do love Reddit.
Saw a video of you guys from above and left
Most exciting thing I've seen at a baseball game.
Member when folks went to the ballpark to watch a baseball game?
Canabilism
I was at that game and close to your row
Go Ms!
I want there to be a video of the guy taking the video of the guy taking a picture of this dog please.
My webcam has more of a life than I do.
Thanks for posting from this angle.👍
Name checks out
I saw the video of this being taken earlier and thought  "I *neeeeed* to see the actual photo". So happy to have that happen.God, I love dogs.
Bahahaha I literally watched a video where someone filmed the dude who took this picture
Minute made baby
Hi is hat doge your is riyal
My man is an eagles fan, let’s get itEdit: wait I’m retarded forget it 😪
Bark at the Park?
Was waiting for the actual pic....definitely 10/10 🤩
I saw the photo, later saw the video, and frantically scrolled back up so I could upvote and comment.
If you don't put this on a shirt you are wrong 10/10, my friend.
Good god this guy tried so hard for this
I saw your evil torture
I saw him on Dogspotting earlier!!!!! Omg
Get this hecking good boy some belly rubs, now
Holy shit I don’t believe it... someone recorded you taking this exact picture and posted it here
Damn, top comment is 15,000 upvotes and they deleted it? Wtf
132,000 upvotes. That’s the most I’ve ever seen. (I’m only 8 months or whatever in)
What do you call a dog in the summertime?
I just saw someone post a video getting this shot.
Why have kids when you have dog?
Yellow labs really are the best ^_^
Wait what is there a glitch in the matrix, cause i saw this dog and owner trying to get this pic...omg to real
What an amazing story, my heart just swelled 100 times over. That was  not a human man, he truly was an angel in disguise, God Bless everyone involved, the ones who experienced ,read, shared, and reposted  this wonderful story. May this world be blessed with more Angels like that Angel.
Man, how did you manage this pic?   Do you have video of this being set up?
10/10 is a sadly low rating. I'd say more like 12 or 13/10
I saw the "making of" gif on r/eyebleach and am so glad the finished result on here too!!
This dog might be the best dog ever.
Wait, isn't the process of taking this picture on r/woof_irl? https://www.reddit.com/r/woof_irl/comments/9djyr4/woof_irl/?utm_source=reddit-android
There's any other pic which was u taking the picture of the dog
Different photo/place, doesn't have the fence behind him that was in the video.
I feel like this pup is taking his grandpup to his first ball game haha
u/seattlemana
Your dog looked obese in the other video, feed him better or he might not be around for that much longer.
This is what it means to be an American. Golden Retriever with a hot dog at a ballpark.
Love it !!!!
What sound does a dog make with a hairlip Mark mark
He had blue cotton candy too, didn't he?
Hilarious
13/10
**P E R F E C T I O N.**
I think that's the diamondback s tr stadium
What a guuuyy 😍😍😍
awesome pic! Beautiful dog at the ball park!
Nice photo, cute dog
Ahh look at that cute dog!!
100% a good boy
This is the single greatest photo I've ever seen 10 out of 10
That is one HOT dog.
Hold on I just saw a video on r/aww of this exact video being taken!?!
I hope he didn't eat any mustard that's a big no no for doggos
So can the redditor who took this picture, and the redditor who took a video of this guy taking a picture just kiss already? Meet, have dinner together....Clearly you two have a cute love for baseball doggo in common so..
Hey look 🙂 https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9djyde/good_boy_doing_his_best_to_pose_with_food_at_the/?utm_source=reddit-android
Beyond satisfying seeing Mr. Good Boyee from this perspective. 10/10
The hot dog looks very fake to me.
Next have him chugging a twelve dollar beer!
Photography is the story I fail to put into wor
Good dog got to enjoy his good dog right after this.
He got the photo but did he get to eat the hot dog?
This is GREAT! A wee piece of doggo internet history. Hope you gave him a heckin pettin afterwards.
This is why I love reddit.
Safeco field?
Did someone really spend 20 bucks on a stadium hot dog for their dog to eat?!
Too bad it's over exposed.
Title gore
I swear that I just saw a video of someone recording you reading this photo

That's a cool human you got there. What breed is he?
This dog looks like "The Dude"https://i.imgur.com/R7DvL1v.jpg
Chewie?
What kind of dog is Ben? He looks like a shaggier giant version of my mutt-of-unknown-provenance.
My dog's name is Ben. I have a beard but he does not.
Why are Chewbacca and Kevin Smith hanging out together?
Is this the dude from duck dynasty
He is awesome!!!
He looks like the dude, man.
Ben needs a brow trim bro, he can't see the funny looks you guys get lol
You're probably overwhelmed with replies, but I wanted to say thank you.Ben made me laugh during an upsetting nerve pain episode. Snortles were produced. You both made my day a whole lot better :)Please put a Chewbacca bandolier on him.How much does he weigh?
The guy looks like youtuber Shay Carl.
His leash even looks like Chewbacca’s ammo belt
HOV Lanes HERE I COME!!
What breed?
What a handsome dog.I heard dogs which have hair covering their eyes sometimes are afraid of walking around because they can't see very well.If he moves around very carefully you should try to give him a hair cut, it wont harm him and when it doesn't improve anything for him it'll grow back.Any way give him some bellyrubs from me.
That seatbelt makes him look like Chewbacca 😂Edit: Just figured out it was a leash 😂
More pics please
I'd follow that dog's advice
[Ben needs the Wookiee seatbelt!](https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/chewbacca-seatbelt-cover/)
You got him so you could ride in the carpool lane didn’t you?
And he has a lovely dog too!
Which one is Ben?
And you let him drive?
Anyone else think that was Chewbacca??
Can he fix the hyperdrive?
Whats the dog's name?
Punch it Chewie!!
Prince Eric called. He wants his dog back
Pls do that dog a favour and cut its hair. Allow him to see.
You ever dress up as Han Solo? You could try to use Ben as a Chewy decoy for carpool.
Looks like the Dude, in dog form
I hope you don’t take this as an insult because you have a nice beard, but damn...his is better.
Cut the hair in front of his eyes back
When you get into the car do do you say "Punch it Chewie!"?
I thought it was The Dude...man
Yup haha
If this dog could talk It would sound like Sam Elliot and give you sage advice.
Give him a cut, needs to see.
Hopefully you're on the way to the groomer to fix his bangs, that poor dog can't see.
Wrong sub, but where could someone find those shades?
Dude! You know Tim Allen?!?!
Ben The Wookie Solo
for some reason he reminds me of The Dude. he's awesome.,
"Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
Hey ben im human sized too but dont feel the need to brag about it. Thats a cool dog though.
Give him a Chewbacca utility belt and it will be largely self-explanatory.
Punch it Chewie!
Chewbacca..
I didn’t know Keemstar has a dog.
Ben looks like the kind of dog I'd like to have a beer with while coming up with some crazy business ventures we could blow our life savings on.
 You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. That cannot be a dog. That is surely a sasquatch you have taken from its native environment. Return him, or her,  to their home else a legion of sasquatches/sasquatchi/sasquatcheses (Not really sure what you call a group of these beasts, if anyone knows please enlighten me) and their sassy hats shall picket your home.  Return him, and stop using the car pool lane!
Ben has some nice sunglasses.
My dudes out here looking like Chewbacca
Please put your wife's seatbelt on!
He's a helluva co-pilot, but when it comes to locking in the auxiliary power, you'll have to tell him twice.
Chewbarka
Punch it Chewie!
Han and Chewie 2018
He needs a replica of Chewbacca's bandolier, and you got yourself a damn good cosplay k-9.
Chewie, is that you?!
I can’t be the only one who at first glance thought this was a guy in a chewbacca costume.
Yeah we get it, it's Ben, he has a beard and is human sized - but what's the name of the good boy on the left?
He needs his bangs trimmed so he can see too!
Okay and who's the dog
Cruel to put sunglasses on him though.
Dude, dog can't see.  Cut dogs hair.
... put sunglasses on him
You have to buy a right hand drive car asap. The looks gonna get even more funner.
He needs sunglasses
He is the dog equivalent of you, I love him
I'm not sure which one of you would get the most attention on /r/beards. :)
Thank you for blessing all of us with this image sir. The internet is forever grateful.
The name's Dude
Car pool laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tell him I love him please thanks
Ben also has a pretty cool dog.
Irish Wolfhound?
What type of "human" is he?
Dude perfect, anyone?
Ben's got some nice shades
Nice! And what's the dogs name?
it’s cruel to let the dog’s vision stay obstructed like that lol.
.
All he needs is a bass, hangin way low, and you guys could be ZZTop.
Things people will do to be able to use car-pool lane in rush hours...
AMA please.
Nice, what's the dog's name?
Where the hell did you get a pet Wookie?
I like Ben's sunglasses!!  😉... and the dog looks cool!
Looks like a dog I'd have a beer with. Cheers!
I like bens shades and hat
Yeah but what's the dogs name
Omg You should so take him to Comic-Con and dress him as Chewbacca!!!!!
Did the dog post this?
Wait, which one's Ben?
How long did it take him to learn how to drive?
Is he Chewbacca?
I like Ben’s hat and sunglasses
I think a bandolier is in order
I thought it was someone dressed as chewie for a sec
That dude next to Ben looks like he is probably pretty good looking.
What's the dog's name?
Both handsomely gorgeous
I remember him from 2 Stupid Dogs.
Which one is Ben?
Trim the poor guys eyebrows already!!
I’ve got two sheep dogs. One is 13. He’s having a really bad day. Might be his last. Seeing this made me think about our good times though. I appreciate that.
Do you have any idea how many times I would say “Chewie! Get us outta here!” When the light turned green?
Man, ZZ Top look good for their age
Chewy? 😅
Sir do you realize there's a homeless man in your passenger seat... Oh, never mind!
Keemstar is that u???
Totally thought you were a guy I used to bang for a moment.Anyway, er. Hi ben!
still not sure which one posted this
KEEMSTAR?
I believe you have own a wookie good sir. Not a dog
Brother!
Chewie? Is that you?
Carpooling right
This guy nailed this picture. Context need not apply.
Ben’s human looks like Mike Napoli.
I am also Ben. I also have a beard. I am also human sized. However I do not get fun looks at traffic stops. Only not fun looks
Give him some sunglasses and it's jerry garcia.
Punch it Chewie!
Are you aware that your dog is chewbacca?
Punch it, Chewie.
Where can I send the beard oil? Take your pick at [Labrador Supply Co](https://www.labradorsupply.co/collections/beard-oil)
Who’s the dog though?
Sir, your dog seriously needs sunglasses.Just like yours.That is all.
Someone Photoshop them into the Millennium Falcon please
And my name is Ralph. I am a dog.
Punch it Chewie
I thought that was Chewbacca
You look like Han and Chewie's stunt doubles
Punch it Chewie!
Man Ben needs a hair cut, cant even see all the bitches checking him out I bet.
Do you own the millennium falcon of cars? and can it do the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs??? "punch it chewie!"
The hat and glasses really make him look human!
[Muffled ZZ Top Playing In The Distance]
Real life Han Solo and Chewbacca

Aww. We don’t deserve dogs.
Ben, what is your dogs name.
Chewbacca
Which one of you wrote this?
#youshotfirst
Ben, the two of us need look no more.  We’ve both got the beards we’re hoping for.  Ben, you always call shotgun  Which causes confusion.  But, Ben, my friend, you see,  You’re best doggo for me.
Please trim your dog hair, poor thing can’t even see
[removed]
I’ve been told it can negatively impact a dog’s vision health if their hair is long enough to cover their eyes. I know you may find it difficult to grant him eye contact as it will be nearly impossible to resist when he begs for a bite of the steak you grilled up for dinner... but it’s in his best interests in the long run (the haircut - not necessarily the steak).
never ceases to amaze me how couples look more and more line each other as they age
He would probably really appreciate it if you cut all the hair in front of his eyes so he can see better.very hansom doggo
Are you wearing a zipper hoodie, a flannel shirt, and a graphic tee? Could you be more internet?
Wtf cut that dogs hair dude
This needs to be posted in r/beards too
But, but that's a wookie.
My dude....
At least trim around his eyes, otherwise i love the long hair. I always recommend sanitary shaves. Keeps the awesome hair, cleans up the nasty spots.
I so thought it was a chewie suit
He needs a groom
Get the hair out of your dogs eyes.
Ben can’t see shit
This poor dog probably can’t see through all of that hair, and has no way to communicate that fact.
LOL!!!! THAT DOG IS WEARING SUNGLASSES!
I'm gonna be the downer and say:Dude maintain your fuckin' dog's fur length because that shit looks awful for him.
Run you fools!
He looks like my uncle Donald not even joking lol
Pretty sure that’s high school nerd Scott Howard
Cool shades Ben
Far out man.
I bet he feels well like one of the lads
Needs a t-shirt
Ham solo and chewie for Halloween pics when they happen pls.
Im just impressed you can type so well with paws
Needs more bandolier
If he started speaking I wouldn't even be surprised.
Is Ben a Giant Schnauzer?
which one is the human?
I’m almost sure that if you call him by his name he will actually respond “WHAT?!”.
Which one is Ben
Chewbacca......just needs shades!
Also, Ben is on the right.
Ah filming of the new Hangover movie
I love him
[deleted]
You get fun looks 'cause you're both adorable!!!!!!
I like Ben's sunglasses.
Co-pilot needs sunglasses too.
Thats a wookie not a dog!
don't lie - it's Sasquatch
Ben has cool glasses
You should buy him a bandolier
You look like Jayson Werth
Um, is that Keemstar... At a StarWars set? I've seen it all.
Nah, that's Chewie.
Put sunglasses on him!
He looks like A Chewbacca
You need to get his fur cut more regularly.
"Punch it chewie!"Revs engine and shoots off
Both cute!
Ok... But what about the dog?
Buy him a pair of those sunglasses. Would look cool on him.
Do you always let him drive?
Be nice to Ben, he drives
Wear sunnies and cap. So?
He needs a crossbow and you need a black vest.
Hov for days
Wow Ben looks like the Goodest Passenger Doggo, please give him all the pets and snuggles for me!
Hey, that's just like your opinion man.
"the dog abides"

"Ben, the two of us need look no more.....Ben,we both found what we're looking for."~Micheal Jackson about a rat. No, really.~ And it works even better here. Bearded Ben wins life.
Hi Ben! Nice blue sunglasses you got there.
Enough about Ben, who’s the guy with the sunglasses?
And what’s the dogs name.
Good Boy
Can you do some trickshots for me aswell?
Lots of Wookie related comments here (as there should be) but I think people want to also know how often you two ride in the carpool lane without issue?
But whats the dog's name?
I need tips on how you keep that beard so glorious.
Bigfoot is real!
Hi Ben,  I'd like to know the Wookie's name.
plot twist: Ben is the one with the glasses!.
I think you guys could get away with driving in the carpool lane.
Don't you think ben would be happier getting a haircut so he doesn't have most of his vision blocked by his hair lol
What is the dog's name?
All that dog needs are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and he’s fine
Your dog looks like he's in a southern doom metal band.
You’re a babe.
Anyone know what car this is? Looking in the reflection of the glasses it looks like a citoren but I'm unsure.
Traffic? Give him some shades and get in the HOV lane
Do y'all use the same beard oil?
More pictures, please. He's lovely.
Is there a subreddit for dogs who look like their humans?
Is your dog /u/petermayhew?
[Alternate picture of him](http://clipart.toonarific.com/data/media/5/2stupid002.gif)
The dog or the guy?

His house must be full of hair
I’m a maug!
How old is your majestic doggo?
One of them has no sunglasses, and the other one is named Ben.
You really should get this seatbelt cover for your passenger seat:  http://shutupandtakemymoney.com/shop/star-wars/star-wars-chewbacca-seat-belt-cover/
Hey Ben, nice dog!
You need to get a recording of Chewbacca's wookie speech and blast it on your stereo.
Any more photos?
Who’s a good handsome bearded boy? Huh buddy? It’s both of you!
My partner and I are having a disagreement.I think this is Chewie, she is very specifically saying that it is Jeff Daniels from Dumb & Dumber wearing a dog suit.Please confirm who is closer OP
Chewweeeeee!
I'd be charging that boy rent & bills.
I just realized we're eating animals. They're basically people. What have we done?

Glorious!
Chewbacca?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it; that does not make sense

Ben's cooler than me. Fuck you Ben, you handsome devil.
Put a hat and jacket on him and that’s free HOV for life

Plot twist. The dog is OP.

Z Z  T O P  B O Y E
He would qualify for the carpool lane. He looks more human than some people I've seen.
Which member of ZZ Top is that?
You are gorgeous. Glorious beard. 😍😍😍
Ben seems like a nice man. What's your name, Mr. Dog?
Ben is a very goodboi
Well, all I see is a sharp dressed man...

We know about Ben. Now we want to hear about the dog.
Now you need to wear a shirt with him on it and vice versa.
Does he have any abilities to heal? Serious question here...
I feel like you're driving with Jeff Bridges if he was a dog.
What kind of dog is he?
I put a sailors cap on my dog once and sat in tabs still traffic. It was by far the greatest thing I have ever done because of the looks we got.
Do you always use the HOV/express lanes?
I appreciate the fact that people really do resemble their dogs , or dogs resemble their owner. However you want to look at it.
What’s the dogs name??
Nice to meet you Ben. What’s your dog’s name?
Hi Ben, awesome dog you've got!
He is awesome but can you please let him see how awesome he looks?
I didn’t know dogs could make Reddit posts.
/u/thegospelofmark are those frogskin glasses? There totally tits 🔥🔥
If you don't start the car then dramatically say "Punch it!"  You are missing out on some golden opportunities.
Chewbacca Mom!
Which one is Ben though?!
Hey Ben, What's the dog's name?
They say dogs do look like their owners sometimes.
That’s a really good looking dog.  But I just have one question.  Wouldn’t it be best for the dog to not have hair over his eyes? I’m not a dog owner, nor do I know much about them.
It's Han and Chewy in between trilogies!
Dogs posting on reddit now... great.
Which one is Ben?
Ok Ben but what’s the dogs name?
It’s cool Ben wears mirrored sunglasses
Ok cool, so what's the dogs name
There’s a beverage here, man.
Ben looks like a wizard.
He looks like the dude if he was a furry.

Oh my god that thing is hairy. The one on the left kinda is too
You should teach him how to drive!
I’d put a shirt on him and hop in the carpool lane lol
Chewie... We're home.
Lmao I thought it was a chewbacca not a dog
Chewie!
Now *that's* a dog voiced by Sam Elliot.
Chewchilla?  Where have you been??
This is Wilfred.

What is saturday for? Saturday is FOR THE BOYS!
But what's the dog's name?
This could describe both of them.
WoW!!
Bork.
Poor boye can't see
Straight up looks like a Wookiee
That ain't a dog, this dude just picked up an alien. That's all.
~~K, but what is the name of the dog?~~
If I were a cop and you used the hov lane I would not ticket you
I was thinking of a Star Wars joke
Reminds me of a sunday afternoon Disney film from the 80s
Ben is the new leader of this world.
Low key thought it was chewbacca
How bad does Ben stink?
Ben the dog or dude (jk)
Reading that from the point ofview of the dog makes it even better
I have a tiny version of Ben
Get that dog a wizard hat, STAT!!
I see you taught your human to drive. Good drogo
And he can drive apparently
That dog looks like 1/3 of ZZ Top
HOV lane pass for sure
https://youtu.be/VjQMpBb1gps
Omg please post on /r/beards
Ben is a good boy
[deleted]
I've got the same leash.
Can that good boye see under his bangs?
This is the best! Did you always look alike or did you grow into one another?
Ben looks like Norman Reedus
DJ Killer Keemstar and Chewie.
Han and chewy
I bet you could ride in the HOV lane with him no problem
Chewy, dat u?
That's definitely Chewy.
If that isn’t Chewbacca
Punch it Chewie!
Chewbarka
Does he owe you a life debt?
Never seen a dog wear a hat backwards before.
Your dog looks like Tony Beets from Gold Rush, haha.
You know when you can look at two people and just know that the universe put them together? That's how it is looking at you guys!
What’s the dogs name?
Which one’s Ben?
https://d1ejxu6vysztl5.cloudfront.net/comics/garfield/1979/1979-12-02.gif
I like Ben.
Your dog is so strangely human.. like the personality and style emanates through this photo.
Hi Ben, what’s your dogs name?
Ben can definitely smell fear.
What's the name of the other one, next to Ben, with the leash on?
That made my fucking day.
Punch it albino chewie
The dogs are taking over!!!

Wish my beard was so majestic, like the dog, I mean.
Nice beard! Cute dog. 10/10
Ben sure looks like a great companion.
Oh man, what a neat dog!

Looks like Steve McKenna...and the one on the right does, too.  #threesheets
Wookies count for carpool lanes right?
Ben, 26Works at a micro brew. Used to be super into skiing, but ever since he bought his snowmobile he's more into that.
But what’s up with that dog?
With the shades, he looks like the fourth member of ZZ Top!
Nice
What is the guys story?
Can you please cut the hair out of his eyes? Or does he drive like that to protect his eyes?
Chewbaca?
You can probably use Carpool lane with Ben on board lol
Good boy is also good as a HOV lane companion!
Hi Ben; who is the Wookiee to your right?
I had to do a double take because you look EXACTLY like my boyfriend, I thought for a second “holy shit he finally got Reddit! But whose dog is that..??”
I'm Ben and human sized too, but since I am human, that is less interesting.
He looks like he slaps the bass
Halloween idea: Han Solo and Chewbacca
Subaru?
And his dog looks pretty cool too.
The Dude abides
If The Dude were a wookiee
What's the dogs name though?
nice shades,Ben!
I thought this was a Chewbacca cosplay.
Obviously you have to get him a hat and shades too.
Wadiyatalkinabeet?
Why isn't Chewie wearing his belt?!?
What’s the dog’s name tho
That mofo is from the Wookie planet Kashyyyk.
He is the Dude.
Pretty sure I matched with this dog on Tinder.
You've been out-bearded by your own Wookie.
Punch it Chewie!
PUNCH IT CHEWIE
Definitely be using him to use the HOV lane
Who's the guy on the left?
Is Ben from a Wookie Rescue? Gorgeous boy.

Please get him a Yoda stuffed toy. I feel like he needs that.
Chewbaccaaaaaaaaaa

Chewie!
Totally looks like Bret Hinds from Mastodon
“Chewie, we’re home.”
Nice sunglasses, Ben
You look like someone I know who lives in North Carolina... Is... That you?
I like Ben’s sunglasses.
Real life chewbacca is much more pettable
you gotta do Han Solo and Chewy for halloween
Dude in a dog suit, or dog in dude suit...?
Literally thought he was in a car with a Wookiee
Perfect for the HOV lane.
Now that, is a sexy pair.
“Laugh it up it up, furball.”
Don't you need to cut his hair around his eyes so he can see?
Laugh it up fuzzball
That dog is huge 😳
Looks like briard.
Morning SamMorning Ralph
Ben is what I want my dogs to be, but they are all females, so I guess I’m getting them Halloween beards for the truck now 😂
Ben, I can’t believe you’re letting your human drive.
That's actually chewbaca
Chewy.. I have a bad feeling about this..
He looks like the drummer from Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Chewie?
This looks great! Can’t wait for Jeff Bridges’ next movie.
What’s the dogs name ?
I'm not entirely convinced this isn't a man in a dog suit.
You look like the guy from dude perfect.
But what's the dog's name?
I hate the fuckin Eagles man! - dog probably
Ben seems nice, but what's the dog's name?
Yea and what’s with the random bearded guy on the left
Gorgeous.  My BC/shepherd/schnauzer cross had hair almost identical to this.  When she wasn't cut for a while it looked like she had big floppy socks on.
Full beard-who wore it better?
Which one is Ben?
He has glasses too
which one is Ben?
They say dogs look like their owners.
“Punch it Chewie!”
And the one on the left is a dog
U/blgke
He look shaggy, but under that beard, is a very, very good boy
What's the dog's name?
Ben needs a hat too.  Or a headband.  And some shades.
Ben looks like Bruce Vilanch.
Cool. So who's on the left?
He needs a leather sash so he can be your own personal Chewbacca.
Is it hard for him to see? No bs, I'm genuinely curious.
That beard is groomed better than mine.
Ben looks like a wise old hippie.
I love ben
Are those Recaros?
Chewie!
He looks like Chewbacca
Can’t tell who is OP.
Missed opportunity not naming him Chewbacca
Hodor
Does your dog listen to Slayer?
You guys look high af btw. I live this so much!
I can’t tell which one is supposed to be Ben from the decription
Hey at least you get to use the HOV lane!
You can drive in HOV lane.
He looks like Chewbacca's hippy uncle
Thought this was chewbacca
This is the type of dog, you put sunglasses on and then drive in the HOV lane
You guys should start a Texas blues-rock band with furry guitars!
Wait a second, is the dog talking or the owner 🤔
they say dogs look like their owners..
Your dog kinda looks like Chewbacca
Tommy Chong meets Gandalf.
Wilfred?
Wow that's awesome that you taught him how to drive a car! Ben is like your personal chauffeur now. Also, it kinda looks you have a beard as well.
He looks like a chill dude
If I was told that dog is actually the lead singer of the sheepdogs. I wouldn't ask any questions.
Put Chewbacca's bandolier on him when he's in the car xD
But what's the dog's name?
What's the dog's name?
If you combined them both they would look like Adam from Tool.
Hahaha, gotta say... this good boy has style, now he needs some sick tattoos and a pair of shades.

Big Woof.
Totally drive with him in the HOV lane.
Cool! Which one is you ?

Hi Ben! What's your humans name?
OMG thats so adorable :)
Prometheus ecstatism
Looks like one of the Sasquatches out of The Big Lez Show
Looks just like my dog!  Her name is Poppins.  I'd share a pic if I could but I'm on mobile.
But what is the dogs name?...
Carpool lane FTW!
But was the caption written by the human or the dog?
Which one is Ben?
What’s the dog’s name?
Bloody Hell.
Who wore it better
Chewy !!!!! When did you change your ride ?
The Dude, need a White Russian.
😂 funny
Which one is Ben?
Car pool lane!!!
Finally, decades later, I found the inspiration for "Come Together".
Hi Ben. Please tell us about your dog
Traffic? You could get away with using the carpool lane
You should drive a Jeep with the doors off.
"Hey Sassy, get in the fucken car. We're going to the water park.""... whatayatalkinabeet?"
Punch it Chewie!
Ben seems like a really chill dude, but when he opens his mouth to say something it's really deep and everyone will listen.
P
The Dude!
Honestly looks like Chewbacca if he was a biker... Or a family member on Duck Dynasty
But what’s the dog’s name?
And what's the dog's name?
I love Ben.
No fucking way. What animal is this?
Killer keemstar here let’s get roiiight into the news!
You're talking about the one in the hat right?
Peter Mayhew has had some costume tweeks.
Doesn't the Wookiee from Star Wars have a chest strap that looks like this dogs leash?
It's the dude reincarnated!
And PPPP
「Edward?」(Aww fuck it)

I also have a bearded, human-sized friend named Ben! Yours looks much more cuddly, though.
You look like the dude from dude perfect!
LTo
So is Ben the dog or the human????
Solo: A Star Wars Story (c. 2018 C.E. Colorized)
Looks like he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs
Cut the hair out of your friends eyes so he can see. No one wants to live half blind, cute as it might appear.
So worth 49k upvotes.
Omg in love with this very good boyHe is a gray golden doodle? How tho?

Fantastic beard.

I wish my dog was that big so I could put him as a passenger and ride carpool
Put a bandolier on that dog right away! He will look just like Chewbacca and that will be awesome!
Luscious
Why is your dog wearing sunglasses
I wonder if you could use the carpool lanes in LA
Dude perfect
That dog looks like he would teach me how to grow weed.
Do you use the HOV lane?
Chewy! There you are r! Been looking all over for you!
Where they're going, they don't need roads 😎🤙
Is Ben on steroids?
Chewbarka?
Umm...I thought Chewie was from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
Yeah, it is funny to see a pup wear sunglasses.
I’m not sure who has the best beard.
Dayumn .. your very own diamond lane buddy
It took me a while to notice the dog. I thought Ben was the man and thought you got weird looks because he looks like a Walmart brand of keemstar
Ben is awesome!
Scooby's more lit cousin than Scrappy-Doo...   Totally-Doo
Who's the dog though?
Where'd you get him the sunglasses?
Ben needs the hair over his eyes cut so he can see.
[guttural wookie cry]
And what's the dog's name?
Excuse me I hope you tell him everyday that he is a G O O D B O Y E because he is glorious
“This is Ben. He has a beard. And he is human sized”, said the dog.
You’re wrong. Ben is Kylo Ren now
Dude- is this the first ever dog to post to Reddit?
But what about the dog?
a cross breed between wookie and bothan

Ben is blind asf
He looks big enough for you to legally go through the carpool lane with no one else but the two of you in the car.
😻
You need to give him bangs so he can see. He also needs a seat belt.
I needed the laugh today. That's really awesome .
This dog looks blazed as hell.

I've said it before on reddit.Cats don't just want to go outside. They want to go outside WITH YOU. They want to explore with you and play in the grass with you and nap in the sun with you. When I figured that out I started taking a blanket into the front yard and my cat and I would lay out there while I played with my laptop and he scratched at the trees.Looks like Op's son has figured that out.
Today my son pretended that the cat scratched him to see it get in trouble.

My boy was a rescue cat. I think he tolerated me because he trusted me, but wasn’t ever really affectionate. That was until my little girl was born; he had finally found his human. He was 8kgs of part feral beast, unfriendly to almost everyone, and barely tolerating those of us he liked, but his girl; he adored. I would often find her sitting on him and “reading”. She would pull his whiskers and when she released them, he would bunt her from head to tail, miaow as if to say “are you coming?” and wait for her to crawl after him. He slept under her bed, cot, and next to her capsule. He would wait by the door when we left and miaow at me until he could smell her when we came home, making sure she was safe. He adored her. Rescue cats are the best.
Reminds me of my son and my cat, Hoover.  My son is always chasing him around and trying to pet him, sometimes a little too rough.  Hoover tolerates it most of the time.
I don’t get how your cat doesn’t run away. My cat got out and was missing for a week. How do I train cats to stay by me or be able to be indoor or outdoor?
This kind of blew up! I own the rights to the photo but credit must be given to our family photographer. She gets the most beautiful pics of my kid and pets. @caseyraephoto on instagram
My parents had a cat named CJ when I was born. This cat loved me and I loved the cat. My grandmother said that when she came to help my mom after they came home from the hospital with me, CJ didn't leave her alone with me if my mom was out of the room. CJ just sat directly in front of my grandmother and starred her down.When I was able to sleep with CJ and not risk suffocation, my parents say she allowed me to treat her like a stuffed animal.The story of CJ is one of a truck stop box kitten. Somewhere on the side of a California highway, my dad heard her call.
I’ve heard Calicos are sweet. I thought it was a saying, but each calico I have met is loving and affectionate.
You printed and framed that, right? Right?
This picture is taken by a professional photographer . Really good picture. The cat, the boy, the lake/river. Truly amazing
She has a “tortitude”. We have a fat tortie as well, and she ONLY loves my 9yo son, she will kill anyone else with a look, but runs to his bed and waits for him and even will bath his head, blech The tortitude in tortishell cats is truth.
Well I must share about my Ollie.  He was born March 23rd of this year.  I got him from the Human Society.  He was fostered from his 2nd day of birth.  Neutered.So.  He has this thing he does.  He burrows his head into my neck and just stays there.  Purrs and drools.  Yes that's right: drools *like a river* drools.  During the whole time I am talking sweet to him...very softly.  This lasts about 5 minutes and afterwards?  My whole shirt is soaked.  At his 1st year appt w/Vet?  I asked her about it thinking something was wrong.  She got this softest look in her face and said "he just really, really loves you" and I know it.  When I cut his nails?  He stays still and if I look down at him?  He is looking deep into my eyes w/this look of trust that's unnerved me.  I love Ollie.  Sadly, he won't sleep w/me at night.  I used to yell at him "I'm going to get a dog Ollie that will sleep w/me" or "Okay, we're getting another cat".  Not even threats worked, lol.  So I ran into a friend who's foster cat (6mos) was terrorizing her two very small dogs.  As she described it: my little dogs used to walk around w/their tails waging and happy and after the kitten started wanting to play...they walked around w/their tails down and fearful every minute.  I felt so bad and I thought Ollie and I could use another.........So now I also have Mr. Baby.  He was taken from a hoarder (62 cats) and was so covered w/fleas they couldn't tell he was a Ginger.  He and Ollie and best of buds. Sadly?  Mr. Baby doesn't like sleeping w/me either, lmao.  Oh well.  I've adjusted.  hahahahaThanks for letting me share.
It seems like they are two old souls who haven’t seen each other in some time.Beautiful.
My cat, Snuggles, was my best friend in the whole world. She stumbled into my life when I was 2 years old and she was a tiny abandoned kitten from a factory. She had made it all the way across the main road just to find us.We had the best adventures! We would go to space in Rockets out of cardboard boxes, Report the news on tv’s out of cardboard boxes, we made our own dens and went camping in the front room, we would sit outside in the rain under a huge umbrella on top of the coal bunker thinking about our next adventure together. She was the best cat in the world. Your little boy is going to have the most wonderful memories of his lovely friend.
Good boy.  Good girl.
They remind me of Calvin and Hobbs.
This is the kind of picture that goes on your mantle for life.
This is the sweetest picture ever!
Sorta reminds me of Grawp from Harry Potter. Imagine having this thing around that's twice your size and very clumsy, but you know it's full of love and doesn't mean you any harm.
"You see that child? That is the blue demon."
Cat:  "You think there's some fish in that lake?"Kid:  "Yup."Cat:  "I sure could go for a fish lunch right about now."Kid:  "Me too."Cat:  "YupKid:  "Yup."

After arguing politics all day I really needed to see this pic. That's a boy and his tiger.
This is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
Your post made me tear up. The photo and story are so beautiful and I completely agree...older animals are amazing and have so much love to give!!!  I hope you frame that photo, it really is lovely 😊😻
Beautiful picture.  She knows more about the world than he does.&#x200B;
Calvin and Hobbes
This pic reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes :)
This is some Calvin and Hobbes shit right here
I love this so much.I have a tortilla (<---oh, I'm definitely leaving that AC. I meant tortie!) and she is verrrrrrry anti-social. A lot of my friends didn't even know I had her because she would always hide and only be cuddly with me when we were alone. (rescue kitty. must have had some issues when teeny tiny. ☹️)When she was 4 years old, I met someone and when she came over to my place, I warned her that one of my cats would hide and it had nothing to do with her. Well, what a surprise. The minute she saw her, she climbed on her lap and put her cute little paws around her neck and got really cozy. I couldn't believe it.Fast forward. It's now 10 years later and that someone is now my wife and her and my tortie have been the bestest of buds since. I have loads of pics over the years like [this](http://imgur.com/a/kXZNeiW) from my wife. 😺Seeing your 2 babies like this makes me so dang happy. Also, high five to adopting an adult kitty. I wish more people would.
Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.
Damn, that’s adorable.
I got 2 kittens the week I got my PTSD grandkids to raise. Those cats trained the kids by scratching when needed and now the cats get hauled all over the place just like the OP's cat. They are both sleeping with one that has a pretty high fever now. They are best buds in a way they'll never be with me.
IRL Calvin and Hobbes?
That shit better be in a picture frame on the wall!!!
I dont normally get choked up. When I do its because I am reminded that I cant see my best friend. When I was a small boy I had a tortishell cat as well. We were pretty inseperable. Playing mario? right there on my shoulder. Homework? Right there on the desk. Always stayed at the foot of the bed. Would meow when I got up. One of those rare intelligent cats that would walk outside or stay with you no matter what. Would hiss if you tried leaving without saying goodbye. She put up with a lot of shit too. Unlike your son I have no pictures. especially ones like this. I would trade everything I have and more, not a single sacrifice I wouldnt make if I could spend just one more day with my friend. I dont normally care for photos but really like this one and if your son even feels half of what I did by the time I was 11 (my cat was old by then so we all know what happens) then he will really, realy appreciate you took this for him. To each their own but I wouldnt show this to him until later in life though. Safe from the teenage angst and all that.
I didn't expect much love from my cat to my son. She was always just irritated that my belly kept kicking at her when she laid there. We came home from the hospital with him, and she was intrigued. She always checked him out. Eventually he started to try crawling and eventually she started getting right in front of him and wiggling her tail. Like she was playing with him. She got him to follow her around so much.And now they're damn near best friends. He makes her little cardboard box condos and sneaks her food. She doesn't have to add to the friendship. He's happy his cat loves him.
This thread is two weeks old and this will probably never be noticed, but I just wanted to say kudos to you OP for eternallizing this moment. It is a very powerful picture.
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen in a while, and it has given me the warm fuzzies 😍

THIS is the cutest thing I have seem all day! What an amazing photo you captured!
This is a fantastic picture
This is such an awesome photo.  Looks like a stock photo or a motivational poster.
[removed]
Reminds me of my childhood cat. She was so patient with me it was like having a third parent around. It’s good to see others sharing the same bond!
Anything the light touches is yours! What about that place ?That is the vacuum cleaner  closet, you should never go there !
How adorable! Little ones and cats are two of the cutest things in my book, and I LOVE cats and babies together!! Reminds me of my dear cat who I picked from the shelter at age 3. She remained with us for 10 years before dying from some sort of stomach issues. I miss her every day :( Nothing like the bond between a child and cat!
I recently had to have my cat put down because he got hit by a car, might sound crazy but he was the only thing keeping me sane when I first got him, wasn’t in a great place, bought him back home with me to live with the whole family and he’s been so loved by all of us, this picture Just brings back so many happy memories ❤️Thanks for sharing 😌
She a tortie, of course she's tolerant and loving.
Humans do not choose their cats...Cats choose their humans.BASTET BE PRAISED!
Why do my cats suck? They hate my kids and hit them as they walk by. I wish my cats and kids had this kind of relationship.
So adorable! ❤️
This is adorable
This is the purest thing in the world
Some animals just know. It’s a wonderful thing
You are a great photographer
My dad's cat adopted me when I was born, would always climb into bed with me at night to keep watch.
This is adorable on a level that I am not sure if I know how to express....now I must go find one of my cats and hug it till it hates me
Amazing picture. He’ll love this when he’s older
I think some cats recognize the difference between children and adults. My cat has put up with all kinds of bullshit from me when I was little, 3 kittens, and a puppy. He always uses a softer touch when dealing with babies.
Our tortie passed last year. This picture made me smile thinking of our beloved little kitty. She would have loved our baby.
Your son has loved \*his\* cat. Not your cat anymore bud, sorry.
One time when I was in highschool I was waiting just outside the school and a kitty cat from one of the nearby suburbs came over to me and sat next to me at the curb while I waited for my bus to go home. I was on an I.E.P. and I got out earlier than everyone else. For a few more days after that, the same kitty sat next to me in the same spot while I sat at the curb of the sidewalk. One time when the bus came, the kitty wanted to get on the bus with me. I felt horrible, the kitty gave me the sad kitten eyes.
This picture genuinely makes me emotional and I have no clue why 😭
Anyone else get a total "Calvin and Hobbes" vibe here? Love it!
Please enlarge and frame this picture and hang it up in your house. It's so precious 😭❤️
Any chance your son's name is Calvin and your cat's name is Hobbes? :)Thank you for sharing this beautiful photo!
Excellent picture. You should blow it up and get it framed.
I rescued a stray cat, super cute, beautiful blue eyes. She walks around out house but wont get near us, she starts complaining as soon as we get a few feet away. Recently, a couple with two girls moved in the house next to mine. My cat wont stop following them around and taking care of them when they are outside playing. She lets them grab her and rub her belly. Im pretty sure cars know they are children and are super gentle to them. I love cats, so damn much. They are perfect little creatures.
Man, this was me and my cat growing up. She was a barn cat, wild as all get out. But she'd just sit and chill with me. Even into my pre-teens. RIP Evinrude. Named her after the brand of outboard motors cause her purr was so loud. Thanks for bringing back some good memories, OP.
I love this picture a lot.
"Tolerates that love"OP knows cats
When treated gently, kitties treat our young as if it’s their own. They love and snuggle, spend time, and stand guard during illness; and teach their owners about the limits of power.Cats really are a wonderful.
Look at the scenery together
I had a similar cat when I was born. She could stare people down from sitting in her chair, but treated me like the most important thing in the house. The first time I was allowed to get up and make my own cereal bowl, she ran back and forth from me to my parents meowing at them until she was told I was allowed.She treated me like her little brother.
That's not tolerance. The cat loves him, too.
Wow. I left my cat with my parents when I moved in with my allergic husband. The first time I brought my baby over the cat took one look and disappeared. I basically never saw him again (he was fine to be clear, just hiding from the scary baby).
This picture does things to me
...Yep, and now I'm totally regretting not having a son and not having a cat right now, don't mind me, I'm just muddling my way through the front pages here, excuse me...
I haven't seen my cat in 4 months and I fly home from Uni in a week and this post has made me so excited to see her.
This is the perfect photo. It reminds me so much of my best friend of over 20 years.
r/eyebleach
This will be a stock image soon
right in the feels
Can we have more pictures of this?
''there's probably fish in there''*What's Fish?*''Delicious! You must try one''
Real life Calvin & Hobbes right there.
This picture is heart warming! We had cats all my life (i'm 21) and I couldn't imagine my life without cats. They can be so loving and cuddly. Don't get me wrong.. Sometimes cats can be little brats but they still show a lot of love.
I used to have this kind of relationship with my first cat. She used to climb up on my shoulders or follow me around and we would talk to each other. I was so sad when she got older and was starting to go, she was so strong. At the age of 18 she passed away while I was stationed in South Korea. When I’m having a rough day I sometimes can see her in the corner of my vision.
This is a real life Calvin and Hobbes. You need to start a comic based on this taking photos of the two and photo shopping in dialog bubbles
I have a young son and we had an old orange tabby girl named Jaffe who just really took to him.  Even as she got very old and sick, she'd perk up when he'd come around and they'd play for hours with this little glitter wand with tinsel at the end.Every night, before bed, he'd get his "Jaffe snuggles".  We all miss her very much.Thanks for posting this.
Son: Gee, Cat, what do you want to do tonight?Cat: The same thing we do every night, kid - try to take over the world!
This comment will probably get buried but any chance you could like to a full size image somewhere? I'd love to set this as my desktop background :)
Kitty Cat is son’s Co-Momma❤️
This is the post that made me get a cat for my youngest for Christmas. Just FYI.
Probably the only time I will upvote anything involving a child on r/awwExcellent pic
Great picture
Really cool picture!
Awesome pic!
This photo us perfection
Awww so cute
I love love love this. Torties rule. Beautiful pic
I adore inter-species friendship and love. It just gets my sweet spot! Thanks for sharing ;)
Oh I love this. So sweet
Fucking aww!
Sitting by the water, contemplating life. Sweet! They are adorable.
My little girl cat is really gentle with my niece. The other cat flees like she just robbed a bank. When she was a few days old she slept beside her baby carrier singing a song of her people.
Awww that’s so cute!
That’s a beautiful shot. And story.
She's just playing the long con to make sure your son is another future cat slave.
This is beyond precious.
Looks like my former cat “taco” rip taco, your tail was ripped off while sleeping in my moms car when she started it. you made it 10 years while in the process of fighting off other cats that came onto our property. bro disappeared one day and even at that young age i knew what happened. rip bro. haven’t owned a cat since
Why do my cats suck? They hate my kids and hit them as they walk by. I wish my cats and kids had this kind of relationship.
thats sweet, i had a big white Tom cat i wagged around when i was that age, im sure to tolerated me out of love too
You're going to like this picture, I guarantee it
Sweetest photo ever.
This is so sweet. Reminds me of me and my own cat.
So cute.
