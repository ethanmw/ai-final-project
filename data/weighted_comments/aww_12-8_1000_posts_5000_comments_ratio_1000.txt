I wish dogs could let us know what they think about. One day, this dog was sitting at a shelter. You have to think they know that no one wants them. Dogs are such social animals, and many just want to have some interaction with someone or another dog. One day, this family comes along, plucks this dog out of the shelter, and takes him home. The dog doesn’t really know what’s going on, but he goes along with it because he now has his interaction with another being, and it’s going well. The dog develops this relationship with the kid. They both have a best friend, a true companion. Next thing you know, the kid come into the room dressed as a dragon. The dog has no idea what a going on, but agin, the interaction is positive, so he rolls with it. Next thing you know, the kid is putting the dog  into a matching dragon outfit. And we get this picture to enjoy.Does the dog enjoy this situation as much as we do? Does he realize he won the dog lottery at the shelter? Does he fear he returns to the life he once lived? Or, does he get to relax because he’s loved beyond more than he will ever know?The dog will likely leave this earth before the family does. One day, the family will look back at this photo, the moment forever will remain with them. That dog will be missed terribly and he will never know.

I think I might have diabetes now
Those dinosaur suits are [dangerous!](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/10/menace.html)
That kid is going to grow up and lose this picture, to only refind it a while later and tear up because of the nostalgia.
This is how best friends for life are made.
When I adopted my second I sent in a pic of her first day home. It was after her first bath, asleep in her new bed, all cozy. Sent it in a/her documents that I followed up w/her spaying (required in Ca for rescues). Good thing I did, the rescue didn’t remember getting the documents until I mentioned the photos. Then they totally remembered. They loved the photos and then closed my file as I had fulfilled my obligation. Yes, still have her, she’s 10 now. Took her a minute to bond with me, but she’s my girl.
hello, my frens, n looka me!am DOGGOSAUR, n So happy!am having fun in my new home,but i got BONUS joy -i not just got a family,i got myself a *BOY!*a boy who loves to play pretend,n sometimes we dress up today we do Jurassic Bark -am Such a lucky pup!so thanks for helping rescue mesay hi to my old frensi hope they All get boys like mewho like to play pretends ;@)
Love how closely doggo is listening to toddler.  "This is how we gets lots of treats and lovies!"
I adopted my dog 5 years ago and just a couple months ago I was cleaning out my email and saw the emails from the rescue I adopted through....so I sent them an update email w some pictures and they were so excited and enthusiastic about it. Made me smile.
My dog and kid had similar (not as good) costumes this year:https://i.imgur.com/PRfKfWF_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumI can say that my kid was infinitely more into it than my dog.
What breed is the dog on the left?
One upvote does not seem enough....
Brothers
They're going to be besties forever.
Is there such thing as an adult sized dinosaur costume and a matching basset hound sized dinosaur costume? Asking for me, let's be honest
Ok now remember, youre a dragon now. So no barking we have to roar, ok? Ok lets go attack the castle.
I volunteer at our local shelter, and I don't think people realize what a lift it gives us to see pictures like these. Every now and then we get one, but not nearly enough.
He's a little Mr Piffles!Well...a big Mr. Piffles
*open the door*  *get on the floor*
I have a pitbull/lab mix that was at the shelter for the longest out of any dog there.  2 years after I got him he army crawls his way between me and my gf to cuddle with us.  He is very sweet and wouldn't hurt a fly.
IDK that T-Rex looks vicious. It looks like the dog is trying to fool the T-Rex so he doesn't get eaten. I'll need more evidence to better assess the situation.
*pupdates
Dog: "Thanks for not letting me be put down, but is this really necessary?"
I hope you asked this family's permission to post this.
You are my hooman
me too!
/r/thisismylifenow
That’s not a dog that’s a dinosaur! Oh no!Fortunately it looks like it got assigned to the right Dino family. Whew!
I just lost my fluff ball to old age today, he was a rescue. This post made me smile, thank you.
Am I the only one who finds it weird that OP is essentially sharing another family's child's photo? Like did you ask for permission to submit this for the imaginary points?Like I know it's a harmless act, the child is probably going to be staying anonymous. But I feel like this is a breach of privacy, they didn't ask for this to be posted on the internet (only to the shelter), this'll probably spread through a bunch of other websites that just steal shit from reddit, and probably one day the child, or the parent, is going to come across this and find as a violation of trust.**edit/disclaimer:** I'm not trying to demonize the post, let alone OP, just trying to make people realize their actions might have unintentional consequences. Especially when you're posting someone else's private personal photos.
Does anyone know where I can get these suits? They look so fabulous together. <3
This is is wrong to dress the dog up.  The dog can choose to be whatever it desires to be, like a potato.
This one should make everyone smile!
Oh my.. this is the most precious thing.
Good on ya for volunteering at a dog rescue. Also dog is decorated beautifully.
And as a dog trainer who has also been involved in rescue, I'm going to be a wet blanket and say this photo should unnerve you. This child's face is up close to the dog's and he's holding his head, while he's dressed up in a silly costume and likely a bit stressed. The dog doesn't look thrilled, and anytime a kid is in this position up to a dog my heart skips a beat
Hahahahahahaha wow that is awesome. I volunteer at a local humane society and love seeing that stuff too
What breed of dog is that? I had to do a double take because it looks exactly like my dog!
That dog is living his best life.
This is my new favorite picture on the internet
What an incredibly warm story. What a wonderful heartfelt story. Thank you for sharing ❤️
Those guys are gonna be best buds forever.
I have fostered several senior pugs who had been used for breeding, had their health neglected, and been dumped on the street when the owner was through with them has been one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. I get to help and watch these dogs get healthy, learn to trust, and see their personalities start to shine through. After several months of care, I send them off to their forever homes. And from there I get to watch as they enjoy the rest of their lives with their family. I get pictures and video updates, and from time to time I meet them at the dog park. I love it. Absolutely love it! Dogs are just the freaking best and they deserve every happiness. Thank you for volunteering!
Damn I want one of those for my dog. Even tho he totally freezes up and refuses to Walk and just stand ackward whenever you put any kind of clothing on him But damn he would look cute
Pooch the magic dogon
How wonderful that this family and this dog found each other! Adopt, don’t shop!
I swear, all dogs are saints
My first dog was a rescue and she was just the best. She looked at me with such love, like she appreciated me. My second dog was purchased. He looks at me with disdain, like I've already failed to give him whatever it is he believes he is entitled to. I miss my rescue.
It's nice no one yet has said something stupid like "He's a dog so treat him so and respect him as a dog and not as an human".Nice to see a dog brought back to a new life!
What a good dog! It takes a special dog to 1. put up with a costume 2. love a toddler. Lucky family, lucky dog :)&#x200B;
The rare and presumed extinct Goodboyesaurus Rex
Aww, I love pupdates like these! :D
My dad just had to go into a care home; his memory is shot and he’s totally unsafe. He LOVES dogs. Not many things really bring him joy, but this picture will! I can’t wait to show it to him.
Thanks for all you do!
Real r/aww material right there
THat looks EXACTLY like my dog, is it a corgi/chihuahua?
absurdly precious.
Who‘s a good booooyeee
My poor half dead broken heart
Aw man, arrow to the heart
Lol oh this is just too precious
This is THE CUTEST THING I'VE SEEN THIS WEEK!! Thank you for posting. 💛💛💛💛
This is the cutest thing ive seen in my life.
This has got to be one of the best pictures on the internet. Period.
We can just go ahead and shut down the internet.  Nothing will ever top this picture.  Humanity has reached its pinnacle.
I wish people were more careful with animals around children, especially newly adopted
That dog definitely wishes it could go back.
omg I need this for my dog.
This is the most wholesome shit I’ve ever seen
It does not get any cuter than this!!
adRAWRable!
r/Blurrypicturesofbabies
This is such a sweet photo and I love seeing happy endings! I hope the owners got some education though. Allowing a small child to put their face in a dog's face is asking for a bite to happen. I'm sure they mean no harm and simply don't know better but the dog is turning its head away which can indicate discomfort.Doggone Safe is an excellent resource for these adopters to learn to read their dog's body language. A bite to the face can mean major surgery for the child and a death sentance for the dog. A little education can prevent that from happening. www.doggonesafe.com
Made me smile too 😁
I follow my local rescue just for posts like this.
Awww!!! So freaking cute!!!
That’s a good dino-dog
This is PRECIOUS 😭
DINOSAURS!!!
Never had a post make me smile this much, miss my dog more than ever now, at uni a little bit drunk and feeling the feels if you know what I mean 😭😭😭

Poor dog
I dont know who's going love the other more.
Even better is that it looks like these might be home made costumes.
Um.. I only see 2 dinos in this pic and no dog?
That is sooo dang precious!!! Makes me 😢 but in a good sense.
Dinos being bros.
Anyone have any idea where to buy that costume?
That’s so sweet!
it made me smile too! THAT'S SO CUTE !
I can not upvote this enough.
Where can I get that costume for my beagle?
He’s dressed like Piff like comedigician
Holy forking shirt balls!!!Don’t think I was ready for this level of adorable
+/u/sodogetip 100 doge for dinosaur rescue.
What about like 4 year later updates? We took in a little turd, he had been returned twice (probably based on the fact he was so sweet in the shelter, but turned vicious at home) but we got him to get comfortable, and now two sets of stitiches in two different people, he is the sweetest pup ever, he won't dress up, but he's the best little shit.
Can you ask where they got the Dino costume for the kid?   We need this bad!!!
Where the Wild Things Are
Ya well I'm gonna blow the whistle on this one after today's episode
Is that a beagle? They LOVE LITTLE KIDS so I bet doggo is in heaven.
how is this not r/mademesmile
Now this puts a smile on my face
This makes me so happy.
In a way, the rescuers are rescuing you
This is so sweet.
This is adorable.
Both my rescue border collies were abused in some way. They were so scared the first night, probably feeling that the foster owner abandoned them. My girl dog destroyed the blinds trying to get out. It was so sad. But, the next they had accepted that we were going to love them, and now they are happy collies!
I am a veterinarian for our local humane society, and I love pics like this! Especially when I just remember the dog as a sad, homeless reject.
They should be called pupdates....

Dino Doggo
This is Alfie, a west highland terrier who we got from a shelter, when we got him he had hardly any fur, his (almost) entire skin was black due to being basically dead due to unknown infections and he would spend the entire day switching between hugging a teddy bear and scratching himself on anything and everything. 2 years later and a good and caring local vet who told us his exact problem, (canine Atopic Dermatitis) for those who are interested. We switched him to raw food to remove any possible allergens, he gets weekly Malaseb baths, and daily snuggles. Also, the shelter told us he was 2, the vet and his groomer (who he loves because she gives him lavender oil massages and hot towel wraps) have both said he is at least 7... shame that the shelter lied to us (and gave us a "no refund" half price discount) but I'm glad we get to enrich and enjoy this old fellows life, he really makes us feel proud and warm and squishy inside...http://imgur.com/gallery/lAmw1wq
Adorable !

Asian mom .... somewhere between 25 and 45 ...
the way her face changes from surprised to almost crying makes my heart warm and my throat feel like it’s closing
This makes my mom senses tingle and gives me all the tears.
This makes me wish my mom loved me more
This makes me wish my mom loved me more
This makes me wish my mom loved me more
This makes me wish my mom loved me more
This makes me wish my mom loved me more
This makes me wish my mom loved me more

Is his mom 19 years old?
Nothing like a mom hug
Teared up irl.
I wish my mom was still alive
That was a quality mom hug
The ending was cut out! They share a long hug, then he puts his arms around her.
Where had he been that whole time?
That last part is her taking in the smell of her baby. I don’t care how old my boys get, I will always smell their heads and faces. It connects with my innermost being. I will never forget their smell as babies. ❤️
I worked in Iraq for 2y as a DoD contractor in my 20s and my first vacation form work to leave and come home was about 5 months after i left.i didnt tell my family i was coming home, i just showed up at the door and surprised them.It was great, much feels.
I love how you can clearly see on her face when the joke/surprise is over, and then, it's all about tenderness.
That mothers love though
Mom is either so comfortable having him that close, or truly doesn’t notice him. But man, the feels. Going to hug my son a little tighter tomorrow.
I feel shitty because I’m so jealous I don’t have this. With anyone. I would give anything for just a minute of this kind of love.
I haven’t seen my mom for 2 years and a half and this makes me wanna cry because I can’t wait to hug her too. I can’t do this to her though because I’d give her a heart attack.
I love that she turned her head cause she recognized his voice. 7 billion voices in the world. But a mother knows her child’s voice out of all of them. <3
plot twist: he just went to the bathroom.
My sister was living away for a while and didn’t tell our mum that she was coming back for a visit.My mum said when she opened the door and my sister was standing there it was like the same emotions of holding your child just after they’re born.
My mother put cigarettes out on my arm when I was too young to tell on her banking on me not remembering. She drank and smoked while pregnant with me. She's the epitome of narcissistic, barely allowed me to have self esteem intact and when I hit puberty she became insanely jealous that I had curves she never did. Everything was and still is about her and at 28 I'm just becoming my own human being with healthy boundaries.. and she's panicking because she attempted to raise weak children who would always "need her" because we weren't given tools to be healthy adults, her panic comes from realizing she failed with me and I'm learning to love myself. That shouldn't ever scare a parent. It should be the goal.  if the emotional and mental abuse she constantly put me through while simultaneously playing the victim parent of a (rightfully) angry child, (however what I will say is that even from the first time she abused, I knew it wasn't right.) If the things she did aside from the cigarette burns on my flesh when she knew I literally couldn't tell anyone she did it on purpose,, showed physically, she'd be in prison. Think about waterboarding a person, but apply it to mental mind games and emotional starvation. "I hate you, I love you, guilt, shame." She hated my father because he was a good parent, and wanted us to hate him because she couldn't break him. I never allowed her to break me completely and I always held onto knowing I was stronger than she ever could be, because I knew what was happening wasn't right and was because she was taught as a child that love is a Joke and trust is a tool to get what you want from whoever. I never accepted. And I have forgiven her.  She lies to herself about everything that's ever happened making her into the victim when she's absolutely been the creator of destruction for many people who didn't deserve it. It's sick. And she got away with all of it.Point being.These posts make me long for the mother I always wanted. I'm so happy for this person having that love and it makes me happy to see that it's out there and does exist. I will be the best most healthy parent if I am able to become one. I honestly cried at this post because the only time my mother reacts like that is if she knows it'll make other people think she is a good mom. I'll get through this. I have to.
Is there an original clip? Actually, I just really want to see this with sound!

When I see things like this I am grateful that I still have my mom with me. She’s been on a trip abroad for two weeks and she coming back tomorrow. I can’t wait to hug my mom :).Fuck my dad tho

Too cute
That’s really sweet! Now I want to hug my mom.
Wait i need to call my mom
I'd like to hug mom one more time.
Damn, exactly how the recording went when I drove back from out of state. Didn’t tell my mom I would be there, it was a surprise and it worked out to me getting there on Xmas eve.Had to leave my car at my cousins so she wouldn’t find out that I was finally moving back.Is it just a mom thing to have shock, then hug and have that split second where her face drops and tears start to come out?
Man. The expression on her face as she goes to hug him and while hugging him, I feel like you could feel her motherly love just from watching. Like you really see that this woman raised this person and he will forever be her little baby. Cuteness
Gotta love a mom so engaged with a game that she didn't process his voice for a full 6 seconds
I thought that was his girlfriend. I swear Asians have eternal youth running through their veins (at least until they hit 80)
The second hug clutch.  THE SECOND HUG CLUTCH.

This made me miss my mom :*)
I wish my mom were still alive. Miss her so much
Hey go Cubs
JACOB!
My mom passed when I was 25. Cherish every moment with your mothers while you can.
This is beautiful, her reaction is priceless!
Wrestling moms are the best.
How old were you when your mum first told you "No pets"?
She looks like she’s up to no good
Enjoy these days when they're teensy tiny now. My tiny cat is now 12 lbs. (THE VET SAYS HE'S FINE NO SHAMING)
My mom told me the same thing. A few years ago my brother asked for a dog. Guess who got a pet immediately?
Animals fuck you up. They worm your way into your heart and then they get old and pass away and they take a part of your heart away with them. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. I had two bunnies, Charlee and Oliver. Charlee was 10 years old and the mum of Olly. Well Charlee passed away last night. Went and checked on Olly this afternoon to give him treats to try and help with the sadness but found that he had passed away too. So now I'm browsing reddit and seeing posts like this and it makes me think that parents say no because of the inevitable heartbreak of losing a pet. It sucks man. But also, they bring so much joy to your life and I still wouldn't trade it for the world.
At one point we all had a cat that looked like this and named it Oreo.  Admit it.
Good for you im sure kitty will be very loved
Now you have someone new to judge you.
Good for you. After all you could get one. I'm 25 and still arguing my mom to bring one home. Really happy for you. Your kitty is damn cute
Now you get 18 years of kitty.
Congrats! I did that ten years ago when I was a poor student - best decision of my life. My parents were giving me the stink eye but now they love Chilly.
What’s the kittens name ?
Aww congrats!! What a sweetie!
Ollie or Bruce or just call him batman
Congrats! Cherish the kitty. Pet the kitty. Love the kitty. You have been bestowed upon with a huge responsibility with the most gentle of creatures, ...now i want a kitty.
Congrats! As someone who grew up with at least one pet at all times, I can't fathom what it must be like to have never had one, but I guarantee life is better with a fluffy friend to share it with.
Now you need a friend for the kitty! So you'll have two cats. Then of course a third to be the tie breaker.. And a fourth so the third has a friend.... I have a lot of cats lol.
Awesome, congrats! You chose wisely, this kitty looks happy
This made me so happy. I’m so glad you got to get a pet.
We just adopted a kitten who looks exactly the same! Named him Notts.
Daww, she’s going to be a little shit! And your best friend. That’s why I love cats.
Look into pet insurance! Pm me if you have any questions.
Good for you, remember it's a lifetime commitment...
Getting a cat was one of the first things I   did after moving out. Best decision ever!
Get another one! She will behave bad if they grow up alone! Its really depressing she will have a boring life
“my first”.......Come on in, the water is fine.
The way the cat is looking at you, it appears to be in agreement with your mum.Congrats on submitting yourself to being a slave to your cat, btw.  :)
I would just feel lost in this world if I didn't have any pets.  Congratulations on your new friend.
And she is very beautiful!! Take good care of this beauty
Congratzzz <3!!
She is indeed beautiful
Ain't she cute!
Such a pretty girl <3
A felix cat i got one aswell, they love little cat snacks make sure to buy them !
 Congratulations! You’re now owned by a cat. No doubt you are anticipating years of cheerful companionship!!!!
You've got a new mom now? That's great.
In yo face ma!
So jealous. I haven't finished the after 18 years part. But im definitely counting the days.
My mom wouldn’t allow me to have pets either. I always wanted to have a dog. Pets aren’t allowed in my building but I promise! The second I get a job and a better apartment, I’ll get a cute little puppy and we will enjoy this new life together 😊
It’s too early. At first I interpreted that as you saying your mom won’t let you pet her so you got a cat.
Meow is the time!
Ah! Looks like our Jack he's a hellion but he loves the cuddles!
Hah! Nice joke. You don't adopt a cat. Cat adopts human.
Everytime I see a cat like that I imagine it is really an all-white cat, wearing a ninja outfit.
I always found it weird that some parents wouldn't let their kids have a pet.  The only time I had to beg my mom for a pet was after my 9 years old dog passed from diabetes.  We didn't have a dog for 8 months and it was the longest 8 months of my life.  I'm happy though because we basically got my twin in dog form.  We both ended up sharing the same genetic disease and were on the same surgery schedule for a while.  We helped each other heal and it provided me with the closest bond I've ever had to an animal.
Why did you adopt?  Are you incapable of having kittens?
I know you probably did your research but here's some stuff I wish I'd been told when I got my cats: 1) one scratching post isn't enough.  Cats want to scratch where they want to mark a space as their's/I live and feel safe here too. Get one for each room you spend a decent amount of time in.  I've found the bedroom and living room are the two most important for my house. 2.) Cheap toys are often best toys. Some yarn and a hair elastic tied at the end is the FAVORITE toy.  3.) Many cats will climb. Provide them safe climbing locations. Cheap ikea shelves securely anchored to your walls or a sturdy bookcase are great options.4.) Double sided tape can save your furniture.
Couple of things for you as a first time cat owner.If you have the money the automatic litter boxes are a god send.Get some toys for him, you may want to avoid the items with the bells because he will play with them in the middle of the night.When he is chilling with you, play with his feet, it will make him use to you messing with his feet and will make nail trims alot easier.Other than that enjoy the cat you never know what he might start doing on his own. My last cat looked alot like him and she played fetch.
Do yourself and the kitten a favour - get at least one additional cat. Either a kitten or a grown-up cat from the shelter. The kitten needs a playbuddy.
"First". And so the adventures of the crazy cat lady begun.
Welcome to the club!
Oooo, you got a nice one!  <3  Welcome home, kitty.
Wow, such a beautiful kitten.Congrats.
You have years of love and purrs ahead of you!
Congratulations
I don't get it either
So adorable!!!!
Don’t let your mum down! It’s a big responsibility to have a pet, and she’s putting a lot of trust in you. :)
Congratulations. Enjoy every minute of it.
Viva la resistance!!
Well your new kitten could live to be over 18, so hope you're prepared for that.
this is the start of something beautiful
She's gorgeous.
Viva la resistance!
Yeah, that cat looks like it's just plotting what it can get in to.
I got really confused because no comma 11/10 good lookin cat
HI KITTEN!
This is future me basically
Awwwww!
I have no proof of this but every black and white “mask” kitty I’ve ever had was so smart, and wily and had the biggest, best personalities. I have one right now, and if he wasn’t always coming up with ingenious escape plans (which always end with him just over the line into my neighbors yard where he stops to eat the grass, because freedom grass tastes better) he would be the perfect kitty. He really is perfect, anyway. Have so much fun and love with your new roommate!
What a precious little thing!
Does you mum hate joy?
I thought this cat was 18 years old and never got pet. I was confused as to how young it looked and why would a mom be so cruel.
Maybe not today, or next week, but one day.. this cat... will Murder you 🤨
Aww he's so cute! He looks just like my Stanley when he was little.
life begins anew
That’s my dream! As soon as I turn into an adult and move out I want to adopt a cat 🧡
So cute! So you've moved out?
My old cat looks just like this new cat, but with a black goatee. :)
And now you'll find out why she said that xD
My kitten looks  like your kitten.
Congrats!
First two things I did when I moved out of my parents place back in the day:1. Got ears pierced 2. Adopted cat
And so it begins.  Kudos!
Woo
You are going to be pleasantly surprised at how much you will adore that wee cheeky monkey. And she or he will likewise.
Little fuzzy pom pom balls, strings, catnip, and gentle rubs on the kitties cheeks. THEY LOVE THIS STUFF! Congrats on the new friend! 🤗
I’m so happy you adopted!!!! Those cats deserve a good home.
What momma dont know dont hurt.
So simple a story, yet so deep the joy!
Super cute. I want to pet that furry face!
What a cutie. Looks almost like my cat. I hope he isnt a trouble maker like mine.
You chose well! What a beauty!
You are amazing.  Keep it up!
Beautiful! Best of times to you both!
Hey OP, welcome to the club. Here, take my hugs. Of course, not for you, for the kitty.
Good for you. Cat is cute.😁
I had a similar black & white kitty.
So cute. I love his little mask I had a cat that had the same pattern on his face.
This is the cutest form of teenage rebellion
When I got a cat I realized why my parents had a no-pet rule.  Listen, I love my cat, but she's a lifestyle more than a pet.
Yeah always wanted a cat but ma mum hate pets (just cause they poop everywhere) told mum that we can teach it and still say no.
It's so sad that we praise these little assholes. Ya want to see mine?
Adorable!! Good for you! I did a similar thing. I wasn’t allowed cats growing up. Got my first one at 19and have had cats in my life ever since.
That cat looks like trouble.
Congrats!! My first kitten of my own (vs a family pet growing up) is also a little cow cat! Today is actually our 4th adoptaversary!
A wonderful first kitten indeed!
Ugh I wish I could get a kitty , first my parents now my bf.
How does it feel? My cat moved in and I am not sure how I ever lived (well) without her.
Cute kitty! Congrats!
Remember and tell her 'no pets' when she comes to visit! :p
Awe what a cutie
Looks like she’s gonna teach you a lot about kittens
Your first so just a heads up in case no one has told you: kittens turn into cats.
Ugh!!! Same! I rescued mine from a dirty barn and he's so happy now.
She's got the "How much do you love me?" look on her.
anything under 30 pounds is a cat and cats are pointless. -Ron Swanson
" 'bout damn time." - Cat.
neat story
You “adopted” it? What does that mean? Bought or rescued?
You can't get more British by 'mum' and the single quotes as dead giveaways haha
Just adorable!
You should check out a book called “The Trainable Cat”. It gives good insight on cat psychology and ownership and how to make you cats life better. I’ve had cats all my life and read it this year. Now my elderly floof is having a ball being trained and knows 5 commands (here, up, off, sit, lay down).
Look at that face he looks ready to fuck your whole life up get ready for some 'I told you so'(jk very cute)
My cat has the exact same face, they could be twins!
Forever will it dominate your destiny.
Looks just like my cat!
I had the exact same issue with my mother until I went to college in another city and got myself a job and rented my own apartment there. I bought for myself a bunny and she was like “I don’t want animals in my house!!” and I was like “okay” and I went with my bunny there. What could she do? Send me off? Nop... hahaha. Now she loooooves my bunny a LOT.
Awwww she is soo cute
Take that mom
All sas. Love it.
I saw the thumb and read "no pets" and I was like "pet the kitty already".  I'm slow.
did u kill her op
And now you'll learn why she said no pets. Lol.
So cute
I really value what pets contribute to a family.  We were cat people before our son was born.  At one point, he wanted a dog so we got a dog too.
we prefer adopting an adult cat, you know what you are getting.
CUTE!!!!!!!!!!! OVERLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Adorable kitten. Love. Pet. Kiss. Feed. Play. Snuggle. Baby talk. Throw kisses. No playing with your hands or feet.
Someday, if you add a second, read up on how to introduce a second cat. We didn't and boy were we caught off guard.
I did the same this year when I turned 18! Congrats!
Good luck for all the memories you are going to make.
What a lovely kitten.
If your car is a boy, feed wet food. I feed like people don't talk how common urinary blockages are!
She looks like an absolute sweetheart! So adorable.
nice great congratulation buddy
What a cute wee goose.
My cat is named Rayla Kay. Almost 4 years later and shes still an awesome 15 pound girl. So worth going to the shelter!!! Congrats on your cat!
Meow Meow Fuzzyface!
What an adorable kitten! Not sure if you are or it is the lucky one
I was fortunate enough to have a dog growing up. And I do again now but my mom and brother are both allergic to cats. One of the first things i did after getting my own place was adopt a cat and it was one of the greatest decisions of my life. You should get a dog so they can become best friends.
Mum
I had a day that lasted 18 years once.
Be ready to experience the first time your cat pees on something you love.
This baby will melt so many hearts.
Oh she’s got a look on her face.......
What a beautiful baby!
I was told the same by my parents... Not because of the hassle for them but because my mom genuinely dislikes animals. Later on down the road, they gave me ultimatums and made me get rid of my kitty. Make sure that never happens to you and your little cute one please.
Just wait, your mum will get attached to the kitten more than you
Cats have smelly butts
This kitten's name should be Smirk.
Oh, how precious! I love the attitude! :)
Good for you! When my mom told me no pets I brought home 2 rabbits, 2 turtles, a frog, a degu and 3 foster dogs lol (all at different times). She mad, but she got used to it because I never brought home what I really wanted... a tarantula.
im waiting to do that too
Beautiful kitten!They don't stay kittens for long so have fun playing with her as they're much more playful at this age. My cat likes to sleep a lot now lolDo you let the kitten outside? Just be careful, especially if there is a busy road near by or if there are dogs roaming around without a lease.
Ain’t he a lovely fellaw
Mum isn't proud if you...
I'm the opposite, had pets all my life at home. Not in the mood for a pet.
Aaaaawwww ❤
Awww she's adorable!! Pets are honestly so worth the sweat and sometimes tears, but parents can't get past the hard work part. Make sure you get pet insurance, it's especially important for their first year, you never know what kinds of things they find around your house and eat!!
Get ready to have your nerves tested. Congrats and good luck!
My mother does like pets, so I did not have pets in childhood, and until now I still think it was a pity.
Awwww. What a cutie. You’re a good person to adopt and save this cute little fuzzy soul
Congratulations! You're going to have a lot of fun- they do have minds of their own!! Have you discovered the morning CatAlarm yet?
Living the dream...
Your life is now complete!
Precious! Congrats :)
Waiting for my first "real" pet (not fish or selfish parrot)
Should name him Rebel!
Looks like the two 12 weeks old ones we got
Hahahaha. YOU REBEL!!!!
Good for you, OP!  Grab some bandaids, too; kittens are super klutzy, and super fun!  May you have a long, joyful life together!💖💖💖
Aaaa what a cutie!! What's their name?
It breaks my heart when kids aren’t allowed to have pets growing up.... they are a great emotional support during tough times!!! Love you finally gots kitty!!! Aka adulting brings joy!
good for you, ENJOY
She could be with you until you're 40! She has found her forever home, and will look to you for comfort when she's old and creaky. It's an honor to be a cat's guardian when she needs you most! Feed her quality food, don't let her out, and never terrorize her by getting mad at her.
Why does she look so annoyed
That face is like adorably angry and evil. I think he/she is thinking "and now you will find out why your mom said no pets". Also as someone with two cats in a smallish  flat chrystal based litter is seriously the best at locking away oder's from the litter box. When I use the chrystal stuff I never smell it between cleanings, but when I use the clay based stuff we can smell it even after just cleaning. Get them used to a covered a litter box now and you're extra golden for the smell, and if you do a covered box some have places for a air filter pad on top in a compartment and it also combats smells. We never ever smell the litter box unless we've come back from vacation and the person we asked for help with kitties didn't clean as frequently as we do/asked and our cats tend to favor one litter box over the other (one is slightly better hidden in the laundry room) lol. If your kitty isn't digging the Chrystal litter (we got lucky and our cats didn't care what type of litter at all, sometimes they won't have your litter and you need a different one haha) you also have to switch it out like you do a new food, so add a portion of the new litter each time you clean the litter box and slowly increase the amount you add over the course of a week or so. It's totally worth it to have a normal smelling apartment.
Mao Mao!!
He's so cute, looks exactly like my Bamboo only younger
Every kitten is cute but this one with its pose just looks cuter to me
r/madlads
So glad you've let this beautiful bundle of joy into your life
Aewwwww little kittles! ☺️😻
Oh my god this looks almost exactly like my cat and I was on the same boat for 22 years until last year
Tell mum the pet says no parents allowed.
Congratulations
It appears this kitty is also saying ‘ no pets’.    Kitty will tell you when human can pet kitty.
Wow, great job bud.
I like how you said "first" like there are going to be more...
I just adopted my first kitten as well. They are adorable little things arent they. Congrats OP!
Just wait now... Your mum will find any excuse to come visit and will be more interested in hanging out with the kitty.... It's vicious cycle..
Make sure to either lock kitten outta your room at night or be prepared to cover yourself completely. It will either get the zoomies or attack whatever body part moves and happens to be sticking out.
No. She adopted you!
Awww
Can your mom discuss with mine about this please?:(((
So cute! S/he looks like mine!
Those eyes.  This kitten is thinking of it’s next novel
Congratulations!!! And welcome to the wonderful world of pets! :) My wife and I got our two little cats 4 years ago (in 3 days!) and we cannot imagine our life without them. All the best for you two in your future!
What a beauty!!
As long as it was a rescue
Oh, look at that ADORABLE angry face!
Baby!
His wait dance is the best, wonder what song he had going through his head.

I’m surprised how calm he was! Even if it was just a squirrel, if something suddenly jumps on you, it’s easy to freak out for a second

That is the calmest most patient UPS driver ever. Actually waiting outside the door in the snow. Is Visiblely spooked when the squirrel jumps on him but he keeps his wits long enough to assess the situation and laugh about the squirrel. And then he keeps waiting!
If I was that delivery man, this video would have shown me running around looking like I was being attacked by killer bees. Major flailing.
The dance and the squirrel, this UPS man really delivered.
That smile of pure joy
I would feel so lucky if that happened to me!!
Haha I love that head bobbing right before the squirrel jumped on him
I dunno, he didn't throw it at the door and then sprint back to his truck. Are you sure this is real UPS?Squirrel is adorbs though.
Adorable! This made his day!
His hat looks like a giant acorn!
This has gotta be in chicago. I'd recognize those houses any time.Edit: [Its chicago](https://abc7chicago.com/pets-animals/adorable-video-squirrel-climbs-onto-ups-drivers-head-during-delivery/4859807/)
That is too pure.
I was hoping a random bird would swoop in and land on his head too.
#ZAPPOS    #UPS
Seems a little squirrely to me...
This squirrel was impatiently waiting for a package at the nearest address to his tree.
Best part is that he is no doubt thinking "no one will ever believe me."

The dude looks like such a nice guy.
You mean your delivery people actually wait for you at the door?Ours leave a note saying they rang and we have to pick it up at the post office when we were home the whole time...Why!?!
UPS needs to get this man for a commercial!!
I'm surprised UPS doesn't just throw the package at your door from the truck. In what part of the country do they ring the doorbell and wait for you?
I see what you mean. The fact that he actually rang the doorbell and waited implies that he is a fairy tale character.
aww I love that 🙈
This feels scripted
Took him a second to come around, but I think he liked it.
I have now learned the squirrel summoning dance.  Thanks, UPS man!
His reaction went from oh fuck to oh cute
Fake
HES A DISNEY PRINCESS!!!! Bucket list item complete.
Nest cam TV. My new favorite station.
Is that... Gus Sorola
Fuckin idiot bot cant even change the title
What do you order on Zappos that actually requires the UPS man to wait for you or a signature??
That new Ring doorbell is something else
He IS brown and tall......
How long till this guy is on Ellen?
Careful. They are lurking on this thread 🐿
This holiday season, try our new rabid delivery service!
Why is he waiting for a signature on a Zappos box?
He just looks like a nice dude. I want to be friends with him.
Snow Person of Color
r/sneakers wants to know what's in the box 👀
This guy has a great smile
Dom: Tom, are you ready?Tom: I'm in position, ready when you are.Dom: Alright, on three, 1, 2........(..._tom jumps ahead of count_)(_Dom sighs_)Tom: I messed up, Dom.Dom: Alright, it seems he's not freaked out. Abort mission.Tom: Wakarimashita.
This guy is a next level human.
imagine having creepy cameras filming you every time you have to do your job
Squirrel: "*You should have never come here, Mr. UPS man!*"
Cannot be a real UPS driver.Not only do they not wait at the door to deliver a package, half of them throw my package at the door from halfway down the driveway.
> waits at the door and rings the doorbell.99% sure this guy isn't UPS.
He must have overheard then talking about manipulating the stock market
These package thiefs are getting pretty bold to be jumping the mail men.
I woulda lost it
Guy is too chill. I'd be freaking out if a squirrel jumped on me.
Everyone's impressed with the squirrel jumping on him. I'm impressed he waited for someone to answer the door. 😁
There are delivery guys that don't just huck your package in the direction of your door and sprint? Wow. Mine doesn't even bother knocking. Ever.
He actually waited for someone to come to the door!  Astonishing, they usually hear my dogs barking and just leave it on the chair next to the door outside, and I usually end up reaching the package jsut as they are leaving the driveway.
Enjoy the new shoes, sir!
Hopefully the homeowner makes this guy a copy of this. I bet he’d love it.
John Muir 2
Wow! Such a rare occurrence captured on camera?!?! A delivery guy actually waiting for someone to answer the door! Usually they are so fast that they can post the "sorry we missed you" card and be a mile away before your dog has time to bark!
What delivery driver waits at the door?
jumped off right when he went for his phone
r/mademesmile
Aww he looks like a sweetheart.
Love his smile.
The head bop was the best part
And with the secret wiggle of his head, the squirrel was summoned!
Squirrel is actually part of private security.He made sure UPS wasn't hiding any hidden weapons frisking him before his client opened the door.He gets paid in nuts
What can Brown do for you? Make my day every fucking time they're in a gif.
If you don’t upvote this you eat babies.
If I was him I'd probably take the squirrel and trow it in any direction as hard as I can, and then start running and screaming.
The squirrel just made his day.
Cool as, me on the other hand would have ran in to the door
This man is probably very pleasant and genuinely nice to be around.
Such a wholesome dude. Buy him a drink next time you buy something :D
His head probably looked like a giant walnut.
This was very wholesome
I wonder if he told he ❕
I love it.
You know the squirrel is attracted to fairytale characters....like UPS guys that wait for you to answer the door.
He’s also crazy hot
Dude, I want to be a UPS deliveryman.
Wow. Did not know UPS actually rang doorbells
This was posted twice under two different accounts
Ohhh I hope he has the best of days by just seeing how happy he is without anyone watching

Love how the squirrel uses the hoodie as a drum, then jumps out and sits there processing what just happened
Do people get their permission before posting all these delivery drivers on reddit?
He's wearing the UPS brown so clearly the squirrel just thought he was a tree.
I currently have the Jellyfish Jam episode of Spongebob on in the background so when he bobbed his head... aaahhh that was perfect.
I didn't know imgur played sound. Can we switch to imgur instead of reddit video?
That was the giggle of a very happy man who knows that everyone is going to doubt this story.
He must have thought it was a cat or something. Way too calm of a reaction lol. He looks a bit more stunned when it jumps off of him and he realizes it’s a squirrel.
I would have booked it
Someone find out if this guy is truly as wonderful as he seems then start a GoFundMe for him and give him a wonderful holiday! I'll donate $20. (but I'm not gonna do the legwork because I'm lazy)
getting randomly jumped on by a squirrel is the weirdest feeling ever... trust me I know
Wholesome
It's awesome that your UPS man actually waits at the door.  My security camera barely picks anything up when he drops off the package and rings the door bell
I would ducked dived tuck & rolled thru his door if his squirrel jumped on me like that. Trying to give me Holyfield ear & rabies for the holidays.
The squirrel simply could not resist the waves of positivity coming off that man.
What a friendly squirrely. Squirrels aren’t bad once you get to know them
Squirrel confirmed, not a threat
Could have at least crossposted it instead of shamelessly stealing it from Eyebleach.
aww, that smile! this made me happy. so wholesome.
U fat?  Me fat!  We fat.
This looks like a genuinely happy guy
This guy seriously seems like the best goddamned dude who’s ever lived.
How cute
For a quick second I forgot which story was Snow White's, and I was thinking Cinderella...I saw the Zappos box and was waiting for him to put on a random "slipper" and have it fit....it's been a long day.
How many default boards will this top today!? My count is 3
Posted to two different subs by two different posters and meeting close to the top of my front page.It's like there's some kind of race going on.Regardless, that guy seems disturbingly content and full of life. He is making me feel worse about my perspective on existence.
Squirrel!!!https://youtu.be/HdiXSsFp29s
I'd subscribe to subreddit featuring videos of people doing goofy stuff (like the dance in this video) when they think no one is watching.
You ever just see someone and with a sigh of sadness think, “I wish I knew this person, we’d probably get on pretty well.”That’s me right now. I wish I knew this dude.
find this man and get him a raise!!
My UPS guy is nice buuuttt, he tends to toss packages over my fence. My DHL driver on the other hand calls me before he knocks AND plays with my dogs while cracking jokes as he hands me my package.Delivery guys are not made equal I guess.
Best zappos comerical of the year.
I love this man
For any delivery drivers reading this, as a receiver seriously you guys make this world go round and for those of you who are professional and go the little extra, thank you! I appreciate you!&#x200B;
Guys never let any unknow animal jump on you ,the can have rabies
"Sneak attack! Hahaha! I got you! You're dead now!"
How do you get a delivery guy who doesn't just drop and dash??!!
I’m starting to think that this things happen only in America
Zappos, buy that man some boots!
Was actually expecting to see his Prince Charming pop up but ok, a squirrel will do
He reacted much more calmly than I would've.  A squirrel is too small to be mistaken for a cat, so my first reaction would probably be "oh my god, giant snow spider".
I’ve seen this post three times posted by three different people on the front page 😂
Maybe it thought his head was one big acorn
He's a great person we know him for years as our ups guy. Always cracking jokes and always smiling.
Im surprised on how long the uos driver waited for you to answer the door. I get the package on the door no doorbell and they run.
He took that well. If it would’ve been summer and he felt those razor claws gripping onto his neck like a pine tree, his reaction may have been quite different. As it is he’s a super trooper and the kindest smile...the man delivers.
He looked so happy!
So.... has Hagrid told ya ya a wizard Harra?
My ups drops and runs.  Who waits for answer anymore?
You should make sure he gets a copy of this footage.
This happened to me with two squirrels on the National Mall! It's one of my favorite stories to tell. My friend was visiting and he even managed to snap a few pictures of them running all over me!
Zappos commercial
I would love that to happen!
So im guessing this is the repost? Didnt even change the title really lmao
I love how cute the UPS truck looks all shrunk up
Lulz! The squirrel was like, " Hey Frankie!, look at the size of this fucking nut!"
Thats what happens when u shake your head like that
I think the rest why the squirrel jumped on the side was because it thought the top of his head, the tuque, was a nut. If you think about it, it looks like a large, grey acorn.
His head bobbing lmao....awesome
I expect this to be golden after my sleep cool emoji face
🤔hmm
break it down...............
My head read switched Cinderella and Snow White and I was expecting him to try on your shoes.

r/DisneyPrincess
Probably thought he was a tree!
"All the single ladies... all the single ladiUHHH OH NO... be cool... okay"
Thats how you get rabies!
Good luck with the plague
*door opens*UPS guy: "you'll never believe what just happened"
Haha not the first time this has happened!
100% Fake
This makes me happy!
Omg. He's delivering shoes and dancing and there is a forest creature. Fairytales come true.
 I need to see an animal text gif of this little guy wanting to sign for the package.
Little moments like this are why I love this site.
Give this man a raise! He is patient, courteous, can dance and great with animals.
The squirrel thought his head was a giant nut
Awww he seems like such a chill dude
Hrs such a cutie omg
Love that head bob he got going on!!
This is wholesome af.
That's somebody's buddy. I have a squirrel that I gained trust from over the course of a year or so that will jump on me and let me pet her and stuff. I always wonder if she ever goes up to the neighbors and does anything like what is seen here.
I would’ve been freaking the fuck out
This has to be fake. He didn't just put the package down, ding-dong-ditch while flooring his truck.
His smile melted my icy heart.
Best to Doolittle in this situation I see.
I feel like the squirrel thought his beanie might be a giant acorn. He was excited to bury and lose it for the winter.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
#happiness
This is a great video even without the squirrel. The head movements make me laugh. Happy guy!
Wiggle While You Work
I love his head bobble. I wana know what song he was thinking of.And then how he’s kinda scared but then just embraces it. So sweet. Be my friend please UPS man
You know he was like “dude you’ll never believe what just happened” as soon as the guy opened the door
Where was this?
Fuck that squirrels can still give you rabies
This is wholesome
Super weird. He just stands there until the door opens. My guy is already getting in his truck by the time I get the door open.
This is a good dude. I can tell because of the way he is.
r/SnowWhites
Squirrel probably thought he was a weird tree.
That's nice. Me, I literally had a bird fly past and under my nose while I was jogging.
I would've straight spazzed. Dudes a boss
Dude why do such cool things happen to such cool people
The UPS man is Job. He is waiting patiently for the door to be answered.  Every UPS delivery I've received is left on my doorstep within five seconds of the doorbell being rung.
"That is the *biggest* acorn I have ever seen. I must has it!"

UPS drivers are allowed to grow beards nowadays?
I'm terrified of ringing anyone's doorbell out of fear they'll post me on reddit
hi ho hi ho off to work i go
Can someone send this to UPS and give this guy a raise!
My UPS driver just throws the box against the door. Doesn’t even ring the doorbell.
Dude is a ninja
I wouldve shat myself. And I'm gonna start doing wait dances too ;)
I thought he was going to get caught trying a slipper on!
This is the greatest thing. The little jig he did made me watch 3 more times
He's part of house security, he was checking the UPS man for weapons... and nuts.
So majestic!
I'm impressed that he rings the door and actually waits for someone to answer.  I just find boxes on my steps at all different hours.  The squirrel must know he's a good guy since he's such a good dancer.
This is the purest thing ever
The squirrel thought it found a giant nut.
Or Prince Charming coming to see if the slipper fits
Squirel!!!https://youtu.be/7ZyoMA7Alzo
What the fucking fuck?? My ups driver just abandons my packages at the front door. He won't even knock!! Ya'll need to receive people like him with 🍪 and warm milk!
He wants his nuts
Have to be honest, I thought after I saw him rub his nose he was going to do a bump...of...snow...
Does one have to worry about rabid squirrels?
Pretty chill for having a potentially rabid animal on your back
What? Hooman is dancing?! I wanna dance! *Hops on hooman* come on dance so I can dance too!.... aww hooman stopped. bad hooman!
I’m surprised how the squirrel is not scared of him
That head bop though
What's that disease rodents get that makes them act totally casual but really they are super contagious and dangerous?
That was a serious gay head shake.
If I saw this when I was a kid I would’ve probably flipped my shit

My family lives in Weeki Wachee, FL which is fairly well known for their mermaid shows. My cousin used to be a mermaid there and really enjoyed it. In the shows they have air masks hidden in shells at the bottom of the tank and part of the routine is subtly getting air from their shells throughout the performance. In fact, you can see a shell in the corner of that tank, it's very possible there is an air mask there for that performer, just in case.

I’m not entirely convinced that mermaid isn’t real.
There was a "Professional Mermaid" on House Hunters. I laughed so hard and googled their average salary... $60,000. I stopped laughing.

She's apparently a very sleepy mermaid.
OffTopic but one woman once got really angry that someone let their daughter dress as Ariel for halloween because mermaids are "the whores of the sea as anyone knows".
It's inhumane to keep her in such a small tank.Edit: Thanks for the silver, kind strangeS! Can I exchange this for a cupcake?
Awful that they keep her locked up in a zoo. She should be free to live in the wild with others of her kind.
After seeing this I’m low key surprised that Disney doesn’t do this for the little mermaid. Edit: at Disneyland I mean.
I don't care but that is cool as hell
That's not a real life mermaid, [that's a beluga whale](http://humourspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fdc5b92b-beluga-whales-no-wonder-sailors-often-mistook-them-for-merma.jpg). Not fooling me again, belugas!
How the heck do they keep their eyes open underwater? Mad impressive
Holy shit, she can definitely hold her breath
I want to do this so bad!!!! At least once.
How does her makeup still look so nice???
That kiss was magic
If i had that job i would ruin so many childhoods :D First day on job.*drowns*
Ok so she went under with no bubbles?? How??
They have the poor thing cooped up in that tiny enclosure. She needs a lot more space to roam around.
Sure, she looks non-threatening but wait until the Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident come out.
Girls enchanted? DAMN! I’m enchanted!
I am so impressed, for Opening her eyes under waterYawning under waterBreathing under waterSwimming under waterNot dying under waterI start thinking that is a fish...Not a human
Fun fact, when she's yawning above the water, she's actually inhaling a heap of air. Notice you don't see her take a deep breath before she submerged? This is that
Where is this?
oh my god. as a kid all i ever wanted was to be a mermaid or a princess when i grew up.where do i sign up for this?!
Shes way too talented just to be a mermaid. DID YOU SEE THAT LUNG CAPACITY? SHE HELD HER BREATH FOREVER. And her yawning and going under without bubbles? Shes a superstar at this and deserves a promotion. Head mermaid trainer.
Oh, why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid, with the fish part on the top and the lady part on the bottom?
The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.
I bet she's all pruney
I can hear them at school rn. “MERMAIDS ARE REAL I SWEAR I MET ONE... PROMISE!”
Bitch holds her breath better than I can hold a relationship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wnsiXzerAg
Props to her. I'd definitely drown in that getup.
If only I could’ve been born a mermaid...😭😭😭
Nobody else thinks its wack that she both yawned in the air and yawned under water like you got lungs or gills fam
Hell, I'm enchanted by that real life mermaid. How did she yawn underwater? Please explain this trickery
How was she able to 'yawn' underwater and not get any water inside her mouth and yet still be able to blow that kiss?
Illusions like this bring magic to life for children.
Where is this?
I can’t even open my eyes under water, stings like hell.  Fair play to that mermaid and all the people who can open eyes and stay under more than 5 seconds ( like me ) lol
Umm that mermaid kiss is adorable.
I WANT THIS JOB
She's fantastic at her job.  I always wonder what is listed next on the resume for one of these Mermaid actors.
There’s a bar in Sacramento, CA by the Hyatt called the Dive bar that has an aquarium above the bar and a mermaid swims in it. Pretty trippy when you’re a few drinks in.
I hear Mermaids don't live as long in captivity.
I was a professional mermaid for a few years! I loved it!
Dude, her lung capacity is great!
Wow, what kind of an entertainment park are these cool mermaids?
This is disgusting, she should be in the wild.
Is this WeekeeWatchee Springs??
I'd be enchanted by her as a boy.
I'm a girl and I'm enchanted haha
im late to the party but we need a mashup of this with the "running out of breath" music that played in sonic the hedgehog when you were underwater
Cersei in another life
I can't unsee the knees
People. Ain’t we great!
That looks like a fun job
Oh I just love this!!!!! Making little girls so happy!!!
Fucking dream job
How do I get this job ughhh
That mermaid has some pointy-ass knees
Cute
That's like, her job.  She has to go into work and be nice to little kids even when she doesn't want to.
Also, me.
I hate when they bend their knees.
I like how she disguised taking a deep breath as a yawn. Super immersive and not lazy with her job. Kudos to that lady!
As a grown as man...that mermaid is ...breath taking
What a fun job!
There was a place in Texas called Aquarena Springs. I got to go there as a kid on a road trip. They had an underwater theater with a mermaid show. That shit was magical. They also had “Ralph, the swimming pig”, glass bottom boats, and an aerial tramway. The whole place was kitschy and fun.
My 2 year old daughter would lose her shit over this.
merMAN...MERMAN!
No one's mentioning that cool trick she did, that was friken awesome
Made their day - good for her.
I saw her knees. That is not a real mermaid
where is this at? it would be neat if they designed it so "only kids could see them". like, tell the parents to pretend they dont see them
Heck yeah I’d tap it
She fucked up blowing that kiss underwater. It was supposed to look like a heart.
She is sexy as hell. Damn I'm enchanted too
Hell, I’M enchanted

This Otter be the cutest darn thing I ever did see.
Yes?
He searched for the pets, then he found the pets!
Most precious puddle puppy
It's so amazing that animals are so cute. They could have been just hideous creatures but soany of them are adorable. We are so lucky.
Oh no, oh no I might actually die that was way too cute, i was not ready for that
I love water ferrets!
Pretty sure this is an Asian Small Claw river otter. They are cute, but shouldn’t be kept as pets. They are carnivores and could easily tear you up if they wanted. Hopefully the human in this video is a keeper or there is some exception why this animal is being kept as a pet, if that is indeed the case.Please people, don’t try and get one as a pet. You aren’t capable of caring for this animal. In some places it is legal to have, but you still shouldn’t.
It sounds like a pokemon

yall gonna have to tell me again why I cant have otters as pets. They're too cute

I absolutely love how cute otters are then I remember otters steal baby seal pups and rape them for fun. They're actually really aggressive and bullies to other otters for multiple reasons.
Alright guys, it can’t just be me... who else thought that ear was a 3rd eye?
Can otters live outside of water forever and not experience any adverse effects?
I loved this guy!
omg its a pokemon
Alert and resting at the same time.

Aww that cute little face! 😍
Do you have more videos of him?
I’ve gotten bit by an otter while kayaking before :)
He's like a seal bunny.
/r/otterable
So frickin' cute! My daughters and I got to swim with them, at a private sanctuary rescue, and it was probably the best experience of our lives! They were hilarious little thieves checking all our pockets, stealing our shoes for stash spots, and sticking their hands down shirts and in pockets with no regard for personal space. And no one can resist letting out a squee when a family of baby otters come romping around the corner!
One minute of that noise and it's no longer adorable, it's annoying.
Cat
Sounds like a Pokemon
Maybe the cutest otter I’ve seen. Those eyes!
 Otters=best animal

Why are otters not domesticated yet? This is too cute!
I want one 💜💜
So precious! Totally made my morning!
I was deer hunting yesterday and as I heading back to my truck I was walking over a drain pipe. We've had lots of rain and this thing has been gushing. As I'm walking by it sounded clogged. Didn't want it to get clogged cause I don't want the road flooding. So I grab a stick and get ready to poke around to see what's up. Out pops this otter, does a u turn, jumps up on the road and hauls ass down the road breathing heavy then jumps in the swamp. Scared the crap out of me. Think he knew I was coming and was hiding in the pipe. Think they hang around those  pipes anyway to catch  fish. He adorable though. By the way, I love otters, I would never harm one and am rather entertained by them when I'm in the woods.
Just the cutest!!!
I can't even.
Until you let it see a baby seal

this is cute, but fuck drug dogs. They have been proven not to work like 80-90% of the time. These are almost as bad and as stupid as the drug tests they give to see if peoples "drugs" they have on them test positive for whatever substance. way too many people are people in jail because of both of these and neither are accurate.
Remember last time this was posted and people lost their minds and got it locked?

Looks bored. A wild watering hole has much more action.
I know my tombstone will probably read: Saw big, velvety kitty and attempted to give smooches to pillow cheeks. He looks so, so soft and so so over it all. How anyone can hunt these magnificent creatures is beyond me.
This is how I’m gonna die. See big kitty, attempt to give it scritches. Dead.
Lol @ everyone going "he's bored, he's depressed, he's miserable about living in captivity!"Kids, panthers sleep up to 18 hours a day and they're nocturnal. Chilling during the day is a feature, not a bug.

This is what they mean when supermodels talk about being 'fierce'. Yeah, I'm wild but bored now
I'm pretty sure when I start petting it, it'll realize it likes it, and I'll be its best friend! -me, right before I die.
Aw good kitty

I always hear “muuurderrr flooooof!”  in my head to the tune of that “Mr. F” music cue from Arrested Development season 3 when i see clips like this. Then i think about charlize theron playing that banjo.  Wearing that hat.  Thanks cute murder cat.

He looks bored, almost depressive. This is what zoos do to the poor animals.
Seriously bored or depressed cat. This is drinking out of necessity, not because it wants to. The look into the distance is a gesture of wonder over when the prison sentence will end.
Youd be chill too if the zookeeper kept putting 50 xanax in your water bowl
I wonder what ballo is doing with the man cub, better not be using him to get free food
No F's were given that day
Hes hung over and has cotton mouth
My god I just want to pet it

I was worried for that dog. I owned a racci in my youth and saw him beat the snot out dogs about that size.
It's actually a predatory behavior, that's how raccoons drown other animals in the wild that they normally wouldn't be able to hunt.>Although I don’t like raccoons, I respect their intelligence. The raccoons in Foster City make use of those canals. They are fond of knocking dogs into the canals in order to try to drown them.[https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-safety-health-raccoons-threat-to-dogs-ask-a-vet](https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-safety-health-raccoons-threat-to-dogs-ask-a-vet)[https://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/would-cute-raccoon-drown-your-dog](https://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/would-cute-raccoon-drown-your-dog)&#x200B;&#x200B;
Except for the fact that a full grown coon kills dogs that way.
Raccoons are the crackheads of the animal kingdom
I think the raccoon is trying to hurt the dog.  This isn’t cute.
Well he don't know talkin' good like me and you, so his vocabulistics is limited to "I" and "am" and "Groot," exclusively in that order.
new Aquaman trailer looks pretty dope
Except the dog is really scared and raccoons are mean
This is why you never let coon hounds fight in the water.
According to some other comments this raccoon may be swindling the dog into getting into the water to later drown it. Holy shit
ITT: people don't know what a coon drowning a dog actually looks like
When your friend promises he'll carry for about 8 seconds into the match.
They might promise you that the river ain’t deep
Didymus: [facing the entire Goblin army] All right, charge!Didymus: [a cannon fires, and Ambrocious does a quick about-turn and flees] Whoa, not that way! You're going the wrong way! THE BATTLE'S BEHIND US!
Isn't that how racoons kill dogs? Lead them to water and sit on their heads?Not that this racoon had those intentions.
More evidence that raccoons are the crack heads of the animal kingdom
Wild raccoons would kill hunting dogs chasing them across rivers by climbing on top of their head and drowning them.
"You go, I go"
Its so cute
Reminds me of Homeward Bound

Lol
I await the day for some country to domesticate raccoons
This is where I remember that Labrador retrievers are water dogs first and foremost.
How is there so many videos of domesticated trash pandas
Good to see Rocket and Cosmo putting aside their difference to fight Thanos
Everytime I see shit like this I’m haunted by the raccoon I ran over on the highway.
Raccoons are so damn smart
It's stuff like this that has me convinced that if humanity ever kills itself off with something like a bio weapon, that Raccoons and possibly Crows will end up inheriting the earth. Domesticating our formerly domesticated animals and going forward. It would take a long time, but not nearly as long as it would have otherwise.
Cutest thing I’ve seen all day
I imagined this as rocket racoon"Come on what are you waiting for get in the pool already" "But it doesnt look safe." "Quit moaning will ya Cosmo, look here is the plan." 'We dive in, swim to the other side and then we steal that guys prosthetic leg."" Got it? "" Good now go! "Wait you never said about climbing on my back" I don't wanna get my gun wet"" Hey wait where are you going, the leg's that way you idiot?! "
I really love raccoons. And squirrels. I would like to have them at as pets (even though I never would because wild animals should be wild). But a girl can dream.
Doggo doesn't look like Groot but he'll do.
Wow, the special effects on the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie really suck.

Sincerely the cutest thing I've seen in weeks!
Raccoons are so cute, man. If I could get a domestic one, I totally would, but I doubt I have the money
Ah Sly Cooper and his new sidekick.
I love how smart raccoons are.
Best pirate ive ever seen
What type of dog is that
No I definitely haven’t lol
This deleted scene from the Endgame trailer is awesome!   I'm glad Rocket found a friend
Raccoons and foxes better be domesticated soon.
Raccoons are the crazy scientists of the animal world. Or the crack heads
Animal communication is always awesome to see
I once almost swamped my boat for one of these little guys. Cruising down the river around midnight and I see something in the water. Thinking it was a log I swerve to miss and as I look down the log has a face. All stop. From what I could see he made it to shore.
Ugh I  hate when movies deviate from their source material. The book version of Where the Red Fern Grows was much more brutal.
The raccoon is smarter than the dog!
Sir David Attenborough would say:this animal will seek any opportunity to use her surroundings including, .....Raiding a dog
Raccoons are so smart and cute when they aren't terrorizing my garbage.
I’d love to have a raccoon as a pet someday
I just see these two as bandit and groot

This is a nice picture, but before anyone starts fantasizing about "tame" pet foxes, please consider the following:* There is **no such thing as a totally "tame" fox**, assuming that your idea of "tame" is an animal which will happily live in your house and actively seek your companionship. [Even the infamous "Russian Domestic Foxes" are not completely domesticated](http://theartfulfox.tumblr.com/post/61131776543/russian-domesticated-foxes-myths-uncovered) and still retain a lot of wild traits (skunky odor, yowling, a need to burrow, peeing/pooping everywhere) which make them completely inappropriate as traditional "pets."> No fox – be they domestic, captive bred or wild, is a dog. They do not act like dogs. They are not dogs. No one should ever buy any fox expecting it to act like a dog. They still smell like skunk, are incredibly loud, require extensive socialization, experience the “October Crazies”, are destructive when bored, mark their territory with urine and feces and call during the mating season.Yes, even if they're neutered or spayed.* **Being raised by humans does not cause a fox, or any other wild animal, to become "tame" or "domesticated."** What it does is create a confused, *imprinted* wild animal which thinks that the human caretaker is its mother. Since foxes don't maintain a bond with their mothers after reaching adulthood (and will actually challenge her for territory) this is no guarantee of a friendly relationship. If a fox *does* bond with a person, it will typically only be towards *that one person*, and the fox may become aggressive towards anyone else. * **All foxes have a persistent "skunky" odor.** Unlike a skunk, their scent glands cannot be surgically removed.* **Foxes cannot be trained as easily as dogs, and generally cannot be "potty trained" at all.** They *will* pee and poop all over everything they see as "theirs" (i.e. you and your possessions) and fox urine smells like the worst skunk you've ever smelled.* **Any fox kept in a home 24/7 will quickly become miserable and destructive.** They require a zoo-quality outdoor enclosure, and that's expensive.* **Foxes require specialized diets.** You can't just go to the pet store and buy fox chow, and normal dog/cat food is not nutritionally appropriate for a fox.* **Very few veterinarians will treat foxes.*** With a few *rare* exceptions, **adult foxes, even if raised by humans, are not "cuddly" animals and don't typically like being petted.** Those photos and videos you see on Instagram are the *exception* and not the rule.* US laws generally treat *all* foxes, captive-bred, "domesticated," etc. as wildlife. **It's illegal to own any fox in most US jurisdictions without a permit. Even if your state allows it, your county or city may not.*** Because foxes are considered rabies vector species in the US and there has been no vaccine confirmed effective in them, **any pet fox which bites someone, or that is *alleged* to have bitten someone, will, by law, be confiscated and euthanized in order to test for rabies.** Even the tamest foxes *will* bite, so this is a very real danger.* **Foxes can live for 15 years. Are you ready to devote the next 15 years of your life to its care?** This means no moving away, no long hours at work, and no vacations (you can't just hire a fox-sitter or leave him in a kennel). **Above all, please remember that the photos and videos of "pet" foxes acting tame and cuddly are the exception and not the rule.** For every "tame" pet fox you see on reddit or Instagram, countless foxes are surrendered to sanctuaries or euthanized after people discovered that the reality of owning a fox is not the fairytale that social media often portrays.
Does anyone know if the fox is wild or not?
Yea, that's gon' be a no from me, dawg. Let somebody else have some rabies.

Malamutes aren't guard dogs. The Army found this out in WWII when they tried to train them as guard dogs for military bases in Alaska. They had to use cruel and extreme measures to train them to attack people which made them completely unreliable.

His face is made of marshmellows.

You have no idea how badly I needed this tonight.
I was waiting for the bunny one to hop.

Role playing
Bawk meow
He's like, "Kill the bitch. Kill the bitch now"
So cute!! ❤❤
I love this it made my day
Does anybody know what breed these are?
My cats would rip them to shreds and never let me get close to putting another costume on them without bloody fingers. I am not allowed to interfere with their lives very much.
Maybe I'm just a negative person. But I can't stand when people dress up their pets.
Thank you! This is probably the funniest and cutest picture ever 😂
Animals are not dolls, get a grip ladies.
Typical lion. Shm.
FAKE! The lion has make up on but his a boy so his really pissed and the cat is a paid actor (Or Actress) obviously...
Most housecats don't get to experience parenthood. And the ones that do are typically strays living outside in harsh conditions.This is a lucky cat.
What’s cool is that most orange tabbies are boys!! So either this little kitten is cuddling with his daddy, or he just so happens to have a rare orange tabby mama.

How cute!!This picture reminds me of my cat.
awww!
My orange Prince is sooo mean and scratchy and bitey!!!
Cool! Didn't know that about orange tabby cats! Our vet told me that many (most?) white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which was true for our white kitty. Also, calico cats are generally female. Genetics are fascinating.
Mammals love their childrenThat's why it's not ok to br eed and slau ghter them out of selfishness
I always wonder how long it takes redditors to get their animals into these positions and then get a good photo.

Youth is wasted on the young
Young blood.

Still beautiful
There’s gotta be at least a million yards of fabric in that dress! So cute
Aww...they are Filipinos. :)
I love this!
These always make me such a wholesome happy. That's amazing and they made my day, tell them we say thank you.

Smiling together is a simptom of happiness

Good looking pair, then and now.

Now that's how love should be, forever together, no breaking up over petty arguments and shit we tend to do nowadays.. Not everyone, but I really wish we could just be happy like that, admiring

So goddamn smol
So is op using her mouth for the camera or what?
The cats like "this is weird, but okay."
Lol that cat's face be like: "Hooman, stop playing with my feet!"
Take off all those terrible rings
Haha what a peace dog
hold me back dawg
Goldens breaking up fights could be its own sub.
I’m curious as to what the context is here. Just a bunch of dogs and cats hanging out. Seems like Disney movie
Retriever retrieval done right! XD
"you on probation remember? let's get the fur outta here"

"put me down you flea-ridden varmint!"
We don’t deserve dogs. They have better souls than us.
We have a dog and four cats. Whenever any of the cats square off with each other, the dog is right in there to break it up. Bless him, he has taken the odd scratch for his peacekeeping.
It seems the reposts get closer and closer together these days. Wait a little longer next time, will ya?
Repost it... for the karma bud.
I’m curious, do people that repost these a day or two after they exploded the first time on /awwww or /funny think that no one will notice or are they just trying to scoop up the residual karma that might be left laying around ?

“I could have taken him Vinny!”“I know, Charlie, I know. Let’s go home”

Do you have any idea how much you just embarrassed me Rex? I'm dead in this town....
This is the shit lolBest video of all time!!
My idiot dog would be bathing in both those cats' blood in the span on this video.
"Mittens!! You just came home"
"AIGHT FAM THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU AN O.G. & ERRYTHANG BUT I AIN'T BOUT TO LET YOU BLOW UP THE SPOT YOU FEEL ME?!"
This is the kind of assistance I need from a service animal. I can get dressed and feed myself, but if someone could stop me from my bad choices that’d be great👌
Poor Cat
This makes me want to cuss, out of happiness. F*#% Dogs are awesome.
Thank you. That made my day

Next day owner returns to find the couch completely destroyed.
“Haha, dogs are so easily entertained!” \*continues to watch gif for another 3 mins*
Is the bill gates behind you
Careful. My dog now obsessed over reflections all because of one afternoon of having fun. When he sees the light reflecting off a phone or something he chases it and then starts licking the surface he saw it on. It’s gross.
I never knew there were so many animal psychologists on Reddit. I've done stuff like this to all my dogs and none of my stuff ever got destroyed, my dogs weren't staring at walls all day waiting to wreck this light/laser. And all my dogs have loved me unconditionally. Just have fun with your pooches. It's not animal abuse.
Looks like he’s checking his fantasy football squad lol
Playing with lights/lasers is really bad for dogs. They will become neurotic waiting for the lights to appear.[https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/laser-pointers-more-frustration-than-fun/](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/laser-pointers-more-frustration-than-fun/)
Please don't do this to dogs. Then they will absolutely decimate your house when they see a small light on some unfortunate place.
It’s 2018, all reddit users have ascended to levels of animal expertise never seen before. Playing with your pet through the movement of light is now considered psychologically damaging to the animal. Can’t wait for the next break through discovery Reddit makes after reading a random internet article or comment about animal health.
A light lunch
wtf does hecking mean thats not a word
Don't encourage that, it's not healthy behaviour.
I have pretty much the same couch.

Good lord. Some women talk about hearing babies cry turns on their maternal instincts. I have the same reaction to lil kitten mews.
OMG LOOK AT THE ONE WITH THE LITTLE BOWTIE!!!
Most of these little ones are currently up for adoption in Indiana. They have an Instagram Foster Mommy.
Spot the tongue at 0:29!
omg, a school for kittens. A kittengarden!*drum roll* ty I'll be here all week!
So much tinniness😻
I wish our cats were this happy to see us...ungrateful!
0:29 - the cat in the back with the mega-mlem
Lil tiny mews, they are precious
I like the gray one on the windowsill!  It’s just sitting there not as impressed with the human as the other kitties. It knows it’s the cutest kitty in the room and it doesn’t need to tell anyone how cute they are.  It’s so fuzzy and relaxed. I hope someone adopts you my little fluff ball and loves you as much as I do right now!
I just wanna lay on the floor and let them crawl all over me
I didn’t realize my finger was on my phone’s speaker while watching this until I could FEEL the vibrations on their purring ❤️
God my heart could not be any more full. Imagine waking up in the morning to that. Tall about life goals
Such cute puppies
WHY DOES NOBODY PET THE CATS IN THESE VIDEOS**PET THE CATS**
Like waking up after a sleepover tbh, just with more hair balls 😁
The bestest chorus. Purrs and kitteh mews. Some of my favourite things.
Squeee! So much cute!
I wouldn't have been able to film this; my arms would be full of kittens.
They're so cute!!! I love those tiny squeeks ❤❤❤❤❤ thank you for posting this OP, made my day 👍😀❤
That orange kitten seems to be soooo cuddly and lovely <3
I played this out loud and my dogs immediately ran upstairs to find the cat 😂
Awww, they're all so cute. :D Little motorboat kitters.

Breed?
That dog has seen some shit. That's a thousand yard stare from a dog realizing it must police a tiny human relentlessly without end in sight.
Which is which?
r/thisismylifenow
It’s like she wasn’t expecting that
Why did you take him out of his cage? 🤰
Best friends for many many years.
She’s the spitting image of my dog Bonnie!! We found her abandoned so we also don’t know the breed either but I love her no matter what :)
Boy is 1 year old.
That's a really small 12 year old child
Now, the real question is, which one is which, it could be a very small 12 year old.
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Your bestest girl is not a fan just yet.
Oh shit!! It's 4:15 I got to get home to my wife!My other wife.
That dog is NOT comfortable with that hug. I’ll get downvotes but you really shouldn’t let him stomp her boundaries like that. She’s tolerating it but she hates it.
Pretty strange to put the dog first in that sentence. I would've thought you would always put your sun first but apparently not. And calling him your bestest boy and your dog your bestest girl kinda puts them on the same level, don't you think?
You gotta hand it to the cat though, most of them don't even make it to the "paws outside" stage.  They usually stop at the "staring out the open door from the comfort of indoors while you hold the door" stage.
That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.
How I attempted my essays back in college four hours before they’re due.
That’s a solid “Nope”.
*these feet were made for walkin' and that's just what they'll-- ooooooh NOPEEEE they won't!*
My cat likes to sit outside. But with the cold weather lately, she'll stand in the doorway for a second and immediately turn around
Me when I see the sun.
Exactly how my pups are
That's the cutest 'heck no!' I've ever seen.
This is the cutest animal pic without an animal in it I've ever seen.
From the positioning of the feet, what’re the chances the owner placed his cats paws there deliberately further photo?

Me studying for my sociology final
This is exactly what I do, then promise myself to never do again, just to do it again
There's always that tail that holds you back
It can be done..............^^^^^^^^^Help ^^^^^^^^^me
I have a class this semester that I've done well in, and the final is a relatively low percentage of the grade. I did the math, and I only *need* to score 1% to pass. It's really hard to summon the motivation to study hard at this point.
I did it in 2 days. Just take naps here and there to process the info. I will not be doing often though.
I’ve been doing my work in advance this semester. It’s taken a huge load of stress off me and my grades actually improved.
That's super cute.
And this container is a sample of a quark-mewon purrasma. Please don't touch it, is not entirely safe.
Im working on that right now and its going okay! Even with this reddit break.
And yet we make it work, every semester.
I feel called out.
If I fits, I sits the final
If I fits I sits, Steve!  You know this man.  Let me take my nap!
Fuck, i want a cat right now
Me right now - damn :(
Well it worked so we must be okay
So happy to be over with this part of my life
Sometimes, I am watching a GIF and I wish it had sound.This is the opposite
He's so tiny and so cute!  I love his wiggly little tail.
I remember one little tiddletot I had to take care of this one time (it was over a month with him.) His mother wouldnt let him nurse and it was too small to fight. (Very very tiny.) It was the sweetest, most cuddly little lovebug. I had a little square laundry basket i would put him in if I was going to be out of his sight and he would cry and cry. I miss being around baby animals.
Nice boots
That tail is all wiggles!
I wanna hold it! :3
Oh my gosh he’s so dang cute
My favourite part is when they jump on my back. [Seriously, here’s a photo from a few years ago at a petting zoo. It was surprisingly fun.](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bm1i4pi)

Real question, do goats wag their tails when they're happy? I thought that was mostly a dog thing and indicated stress in most other animals. This little guy definitely didn't look stressed, I'm just curious

Kay but I wasnt the only one asking why they were cooking their phone right?
Thank god I can see how beautiful the fire is on that iphone screen
Dog is looking like he's thinking okay you humans with your fancy thumbs get to making the smores

Dumb question but does Baby Jesus not get put out in the Nativity Scene until a certain day? The church that I pass every day on the way to work has the setup with no Jesus and I keep wondering if someone stole it.
takes his tithing in mousies

gonna start referring to my cats as holy children

Blasphemous but I love it

Jesus? *I ate 'em!*
I believe!
A purrfect Christmeows
You can see the cat thinking "I'm extremely angry at you for doing this, but I'm too lazy to get up."
That’s what I call catitude.
The new Grinch looks realistic
This cats expression seem extremely accurate for having to live in Gods footsteps

Joseph looks truly done with Mary's shit.
Either a red light bulb or a latex, ribbed butt-plug...
TIL cheetahs sounds like yoshi.
Reow
I dont care if i would loose an arm, the urge to pet them would be irresistible.
Cheetahs were my FAVORITE animal growing up so my info might be a little rusty. Cheetahs make a TON of different sounds. My favorite are the bird chirps moms and cubs do to communicate with each other. I believe they make this noise in particular because they’re like on the bottom of the predator food chain. So the less attention they draw to themselves (and especially their cubs) the better. So the bird chirps sound like bird chirps as a disguise? I’m kinda hungover, I hope this makes sense. Cheetahs also purr a lot. They purr so hard their body vibrates. Also there’s only been like a handful of recorded cheetah on human attacks in the wild. And most if not all in-captivity attacks were simply mistakes, ie cheetah accidentally bites hand when it was going for the chicken in said hand. Also, cheetahs are pretty much always on the verge of starvation. They require so many calories to function. And because again, they’re on the bottom of the predator food chain, they often times don’t have long to eat whatever they hunt cause they’ll get chased off by hyenas, lions, etc.
Had the same reaction when I heard *David Beckham* speak for the first time
Love how the second one starts to come up like “oh REALLY? You think my friend sounds CUTE?? I’ll show you cute... ah hell your filming this..”
I want to give him a pat pat. He’s a good boy
And they want treats.
They're so beautiful.  They sound a lot like housecats.
I must resist the urge to give chin scritches.
Nothing can surprise me anymore after hearing what a koala sounds like.
The peregrine falcon would like to have a word with you:I CAN DIVE BOMB 142 MPH AND FALCON PUNCH A RABBIT AT THAT SPEED, AND I SOUND LIKE A BOSS!
r/catsgonnacat
Fun fact! Cheetahs are the only cats without retractable claws
At 20 seconds in, it sounds pretty intimidating.
Aww, they're so cute. :) I'll keep my hands away though, as tempting as it would be to give them headpats.
Mow. Moow. Mooww.. Mow.
Didn't know they sounded like cat penguins
I would have to touch it, it would be an unresistible urge.
Cheeto
"Hey man.... you want to stick your arm through the fence for us?"
Mike Tyson
I’ve used a cheetah purring as ASMR to sleep before. Worked like a charm.
Considering what they are capable of to get what they want, they really don't need to sound intimidating so why not sound cute?
Why do they sound like Yoshi
pet him you callous monster!
Bluffing, waiting for the one idiot to put their hand through and losing it
Sounds like chewbacca to me
Roar or purr, never both!
That growl still sounds menacing and primal.
They used to be trained to ride behind the saddle on a horse and help people hunt, like a more dangerous greyhound. [Good kitty](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/02/priority-ancient-times-middle-east-india-people-tamed-cheetahs-trained-ride-horses/)
I showed this to my cat and she got totally freaked out 😹
Please someone make a video with Owen Wilson and  the sounds from this.
Was expecting weird Russian singer heh..
Well, they are cats.
waw i love it
They're like a meowing dinosaur
That could be the greatest sound I've ever heard
I think falcons are technically the fastest.
Putty tats will be putty tats.....
“Food. Fooood. food..... I want. Some food. F.. food, please.”
*MUST RESIST URGE TO PETS!!!* Well,I didn't really need two arms...worth it.
That’s how they get you. All cute and then BAM you’re dead.
Well, I mean, cats are nature’s smallest (cutest?  Who knows) killing machines, these just large kitties...
Repost.
/r/microbork
Peregrine falcon kills while traveling faster.
*inquisitive honking*
It's a Yoshi
Everytime I walk towards the kitchen
I started playing the sound and my cat's ears immediately perked up. I showed her the screen and she was transfixed.
A cat is a cat, daaaawwwgggg.
So fucking cute.
remember the fastest acceleration is of the tesla and there's only the sound of the tyres screeching
I don’t know, the second one sounds a lot closer to expectations.
I'm going to kill you... with kindness. It'll be fast, but also very sweet. Listen to my death noise: Reow.
#BiB KidDy
I'm crying because I love them
Boom boom boom let me hear you say reoow
Natures fastest killing machine goes 250mph, a Golden Eagle can manage 150mph but the cheetah tops 60mph. Is this even the fastest mammal?
I’d be the idiot to hiss at them to annoy them in that caged car
Monkey brain say petMonkey brain bad at this surviving thing
Sounds like a cat that hit puberty.
The peregrine falcon would like to have a word with you OP.
The peregrine falcon can reach up to 200 mph
So cute, I love cheetahs. ♡♡
Two of my cats are very annoyed because they cant find the kitty in mom's phone.
Sounds like David Beckham
They sound the exact opposite of cute... lol 😂
I make that sound, when playing with my toy cars!
Look at these pritta keethas so preshhhhh. 10/10 would pet
Fastest on the land, birds of prey attack at much higher speeds. Peregrine falcons can reach ridiculous speeds when diving.
*Not the fastest But still makes a cute as heck sound though.
You laugh, they chase you down and utterly destroy you.  :)
Chewbacka is that you ?
It's a TRAP
Man for a second I forgot they want to rip you limb from limb...
Hate to be that guy. Nature's fastest killing machine title goes to the peregrine falcon. The tl/Dr is cheetas win in acceleration. Falcons win in speed. There for bird boi zoomiest.
Fact: without humans, cheatahs would be extinct - they duck at hunting despite being quick, often losing their kill to other predators
That tail is going wild 😍
And from that moment on, no more work was accomplished 😍
Pittie puppy?
There should totally be an official "take your pet to work" day
Oh man, the innocence in those eyes.
Tail on borkdrive
Beautiful intelligent eyes showing the way to their loving heart.

Who?
A distraction... That's who
That tail though!!!!
Lil dude looks like Rami Malek
This looks exactly like a miniature version of my Hansom Herman Monster.  With the exception of the eyes.  My guy only has one so all that love shines double through the other.
Those paws
10000% angel wow
You can tell from his expression that that puppy is using every bit of his willpower to stay still, the moment you reach out to pet him, he’s going to go wild!
Good target for hundred of hugs
Aww that’s the best little visitor.
Look who’s a good boy! 👏🏼👏🏼 give him pets, belly rubs and treats 😘
He is beyond perfect 😍
"Please, please... come back home..."
Great names.
What are your horses doing inside?
Is that where they use the Floo Network?
tfw your bro gets called Kingsley and you get named Tonks
Best names **everrr.** My cat, Minerva and my 6 year old human, Neville, would both agree!
I was on the home page scrolling and didn't notice which sub it was and was expecting a cosplay from Harry Potter
Great shot

Why not name them Lupin and Tonks?
I have a Tonks too! She’s a cat, not a beautiful Great Dane
Names perfectly go with the dog

Awww, they're so adorable. :D Great names, by the way!

I have to ask, what is the rubber tire doing there, a dog toy?
Where's Lupin?
My uncle and his girlfriend have a blue Great Dane pup. Clumsy little pupper
huh, the grass was actually greener on the other side of that fence
Those jumps always scare me. I just imagine the pup judging it wrong and then oh no.
Barkour!
I did not know that dogs can fly
Yea that’s neat until he miss judges and gets a paw stuck in the chain link and breaks a leg.  Or disembowells himself.
Is this a Belgian Malinois?
Why would you encourage your dog to do that? Seems kinda dangerous
This makes me scared now when I see dogs barking at me behind a fence
Wow, just wow!
That's some advanced-level zoomies right there
That dog don't need no asylum papers to cross into the States
NYOOOM
Nobody should encourage their dog to do this. The risk is too high that he could really hurt himself. We have to help dogs... they help us enough for fucks sake

Moon2DEV
When my old cat had kittens 4 of them were the sweetest kittens but the fifth was just a miserable prick. Great to two siblings,  especially the runt but  a shit to the others. Hated humans. Get within five feet this prick would hiss. Pay attention to the siblins, hiss. Pick up the runt? Follow you around hissing. Could barely walk or see yet. Three weeks old and hissing. Picked it up one time to give it attention and try to get him acclimated to humans so he could get adopted and thought it was working til his ass stopped mid purr to hiss, then purr then look at me and hiss. Went as a pair with the runt since they were inseperable
Those cats definitely run barter town
When I hide under the sheets in my bed, my air gets warm and stagnant. Do you think his water gets warm and gross too?

The hoodie is bothering the cat a lot because of that they could hurt themselves, that's why you shouldn't dress your cat up when it reacts like that :/

Much like the pallas cat which is often mistakenly referred to as "chonk" when they're actually "floff", this is a chinchilla, a little chonk but mainly floff. IIRC, they live in cooler climates and much like pallas cats, their fur helps them survive chilly conditions.Fun fact: Chinchillas have the densest fur of all land mammals. Only otters out-fur them with with a density that varies from 170,000-1,062,000 hairs per square inch (depending on the location of the body).

You have to get her a sock for Christmas to complete the joke. In fact get her a sock EVERY YEAR
I just love how it has such big cute eyes and looks soo happy
I love it when their eyes are dilated like that. +10 cuteness.

"environmentally friendly" that is if you think that sick crossbreeding expiriments between dogs and melons are environmentally friendly.
When I have kids, this is how I now plan to take them places.
imagine the sticky fur
I would buy a couple of those puppermellons.
I’m so jealous of how much free time this lady must have on her hands, and the things she has the luxury to think about before she falls asleep.
ugh, thats like being carted around in a wet diaper, the poor dogs. now theyll be sticky and smell like sweet rotten fruit
Melonmutes.
This is the cutest thing ever, but reddit loves to upvote the negative thoughts and aspects of it. Who cares if theyre sticky!
My main question is how they got the pups inserted into the melons without breaking the melons. Not only is this cute, but an interesting logistical feat as well.
Amazing
I found the cutest thing on the internet, my mission is over, goodbye reddit

NO THATS A REAL DOG DONT FUCKING @ ME
I seriously thought I was looking at the sky at first.
There's a dead cat in the bottom right of the picture
I think the fact that someone went to great lengths to make it look like a dog, makes it look like a pupper in the snow.Also the photoshop does too.
My dog hated water when she was about this age, but I lived at the beach at the time and really wanted her to enjoy it. It took some time and work but I gradually introduced her to the ocean playing fetch and tug of war- at first just getting her paws wet was an ordeal, but by the time she was about 1 she was full speed ahead taking on crashing waves chasing a frisbee. Can hardly keep her out of the water these days. Although it's more small streams than oceans where I'm at now.
"Hey no fair, come back on land so I can chase you some more!"
Soooo PRECIOUS!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Heckin' ducks. >_<
He's thinking you ducks are just lucky you're out there on the water or you'd be in so much trouble

What kind of dog is this?

Pay attention to me!!!
try setting up a warm comfy spot nearby. cats usually sit around on laptop keyboards because they're warm so a more comfy alternative should do the trick to keep him off.
This is one of the cutest kittens I’ve ever seen.
I hope you're petting that cat right this instant.

(S)he has that expression of being way too luxurious to be kept in a cardboard box.Enjoy the 30 minutes you have with him/her before it is all grown up.
This has made my whole week! Cutest EVER
Good luck! First couple weeks are filled with sleepless nights and cleaning up messes, but enjoy it now because they grow up super fast and you’ll miss the puppy phase.
That side eye 😂... “i’m getting daily treats coming with you right?”
You'd better give that dog ANYTHING it wants.
Awww congratulations
Are you going to die simultaneously?
Shes looking at you like "You will make an acceptable servant"
What a cutie!!! Such a kind soul taking her in... one of my friends had a cat he let outside that kept getting pregnant and he didnt get her spayed so we ended up taking her in and she hasn't even wanted to go outside and it's like they sense we're trying to give them a better life!One of the best bonds in the world you can have :D
Not to rain on your parade, but are you certain she's a stray?  Some people let their cats roam outside without collars. You should get her checked for a microchip at the clinic as soon as possible, in case a current owner is looking for her.  If she's unowned, enjoy your new cat!
A stray cat let you give her a bath!? That's madness!
What a pretty girl. Thank you for becoming a pet parent!
She is gorgeous!
Is her left eye ok or is that just a strange angle of shadow?
Such a beautiful girl! I’ve recently fallen back in love with cats and this lady is precioussss. Please keep posting her!
Strays are the best and she's a pretty lady! Both my cats were strays and they became the most affectionate, cuddly, and lovable little monsters. Just make sure you get regular vet checks. Street cats tend to harbor hidden health problems.
Awwwww.
Picture of happiness ☺️
A stray not only let you give her a bath, but has just accepted a handkerchief?... I charge you with attempted bamboozlement!
You have Instant Karma now. Good Human!
Almost certainly not a stray.
*Or*Cats defend bovine friend by spewing milk at handsy protagonist
Idk why but i find this funny. Maybe its the cats facial expression.
Thanks for the memory! I used to help my uncle with the cows. The (well-fed) barn cats ***always*** showed up in time for milking to get their treats, twice a day, every day.
As a child I watched my uncle do this on his dairy farm. He had about 8 barn cats you could not get close to but at milking time they lined up for some pay.  Nice memories.
Cat.

Not really, mama wants the baby and then proceeds to lick nasty human scent off the bubba

Awwww. :( the mummy cat does not trust the human.
Mom cat terrified a predator stole her kitten, so cute
“That’s MY baby!”

Now you've lost mama kitty's trust. Mama kitty never forgets.
Mommy love
Taunting a mother cat by making it think its baby is in danger is pretty cute
I think it's cute too. But I have seen this WAY too many times.

Dude get off your phone when you're driving
The dogs are adorable but I’m so worried about the fact that you’re focusing on filming the doggos.. especially while there’s a fire truck with sirens on around you. All of that combined is scary
My family friend was killed by someone doing something very similar in this video.
Why do you have a van full of dogs?
I mean, you are crossing an intersection while looking behind you. Love the idea of this post. Doggo alarm is on point.

Take good care of her joints and give lots of leg rubs
Sorry to hear about her father's passing. I knew some people who had a bunch of great Danes and apparently they can have strong separation anxiety. Like to the point of not eating. I hope she's doing okay. Glad she has someone to love her
Give her all the love. She also lost her person.
What an honor to be left such a magnificent creature.    Give her lots of love and glucosamine treats and she'll soon love you just as much in return.
So cute
They are the best dogs! So loving and lazy. If you have any questions feel free to ask, we have an 8 year old girl. She's our second dane.
That dog looks classier and more dignified than most people I know

He is going to need a bigger crate in about two weeks the way they grow.
I love floppy ears on a Dane. I think it looks better than cropped.
the caption was so funny to me. LOL
Those ears are probably softer than the finest silk
That little pup will grow out of the cage in about 6 months, because of those long limbs.
I'm pretty sure that's a rabbit
The great dane. When you want a dog, but not for over 3 years.
Keep an eye out on his hips. Sometimes they can grow so fast, they will need calcium supplements to keep up.
I think you mean before they grow into anything on their bodies!

Doggy likes the beat 💃🏼🕺🏼
My dog did this about a year ago when we were listening to music, he progressively started to groove harder and harder, then started puking all over the floor. Found out my roommates had poisoned him with antifreeze...fun times
What's with all the tomatillo husks?
Sooooo swaaaagggggg
Oddly satisfying
Someone is definitely swaying the dog at the hips and hiding out of frame. I used to do this with my dog minus the filming.
enjoying spanish music? a dog with TASTE
He’s reminiscing on his good doggo Times. When he could chases the females doggos without getting tired.
Not to ruin the illusion, but it's simply getting lower back scratches from someone that isn't visible in the video because of the angle. That's why its swaying left to right like that and enjoying life.
Someone sucking that mutt off?

I accept!

First of all, this is fuckin' adorable as heck. It also reminds me something I think everyone should know, if an unaccompanied service dog comes up to you, you should follow them, they're probably trying to get you to come help their owner!
LUL poor kitty, what happened?
We have a cat with the same condition.  Powdered L-Lysine for cats mixed with a small amount of wet food twice a day really helped that eyelid to recede and great for their immune system!
hm. more like 0.5/2 eyes
What a sweetheart!
I had a dog like that. My dad called her cuch...
Awww, poor kitty. She's still adorable even without her left eye. Just because they might be missing an eye or a leg doesn't mean a lick of difference, and they all still deserve love. :)
What a pretty kitty.
this is the cutest dog in the world.
Those are some pretty eyes. TIL dogs have the most beautiful eyes.
I love the glance up. My pup would just be like "Oh cool, more treats." And proceed to inhale them.

Hello darkness my old friend...
Aanndd now you have chlamydia
I'm an Aussie and I love koalas, however they are grumpy pricks. They are quite likely to scratch the shit out of you. Echidnas on the other hand are the cutest little buggers you will ever see.
Insert [Koalas are terrible animals](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5u1l9x/koalas_are_terrible_animals/) copypasta here.
He's just beautiful!
No? No one? Alright, I’ll do the honours of the copying and the pasting. Here we go:Koalas are fucking horrible animals.They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a  room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death.This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life.Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.
I just wanna snuggle it
Until you take away it’s happy drugs... then they become vicious little monsters... kind of like a gremlin
It’s a stuffed toy ;)
He’s not sleeping. He’s just drunk or high.
What does a koala's fur feel like?
They sometimes feed their offspring by shitting into their mouths.

I used to think having twins would be cool... Then we had our first baby. One is all I can handle.Watching them learn how to do simple things like crawl, hold their own bottle, and eat solid foods is so much fun.
Baby drool should be weaponized. It is endless and gets everywhere and everyone.

My little brothers are twins (9 years younger) and I can't explain to people the difference TWO makes. One kid figuring stuff out, mistake here, bump there. Twin BOYS?!Competition to see who can run, scream, jump, break, fix, hide the fastest.Fun times.
OMG so cute
Im all done having babies and stuff like this makes me desperatly want to have more.  Thankfuy having 4 kids I know I'll have grandbabies to spoil (more then likely, all my kids are 13-20) in the next 10 years.

That’s probably the best love story. Congratulations!
This sounds like a true fairytale.
I see the pink collar; but that's your best man right there.

She knows
Absolutely gorgeous story and gorgeous doggo... So happy for you both x
You’ll never know, but behind those eyes she has been regretting that first day you petted her. You have stolen her owner and she is stuck with you now.
Those eyes show us she knows what's up.  You owe her!
What good girl she is. Your Angel in disguise.
It’s amazing how you “just know”.
Creepy human tongue alert.
The tongue kinda freaked me out at first, I’ve never seen a bunny lick it’s mouth before. Cute bunny though
This. Is. Glourious.
It’s kinda intimidating
If you didn’t wipe the top banana bit off his nose after this, you are a monster...
His fat little cheeks! I wanna squeeze them!
I thought the slomo was unnecessary, I was happy to be wrong
This was a spiritual experience for me
So much fluff!!
TIL bunnies have Predator faces.
I was eating while watching this and found myself in sync to bunny munchin
Whoa! Is this why they call a cleft pallet a harelip?
That's going to be the couple soon
My first reaction is "aww, poor pooch! ☹", but the big dog might very well be an asshole.
I swear as soon as I saw the pic I just thought "to Vallhala!"
Theres alot going on here but that guy is definitely a r/fuckmyshitup heavyweight contender.
ADORABLE

Is her name Bella?
Looks like the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm came through!
She looks like a heckin’ good girl.
"Two creams, one sugar, and a pinch of dog hair" <3
That look of love just melted my heart!
i can think of worse ways to have your morning coffee, Mine does the same thing
How precious! ❤️❤️❤️
I have my morning coffee while looking at pet photos on Reddit, so thanks and keep up the good work.
That's not coffee, it's a cat.
Excellent

Well, that’s damned adorable.
Amazing !
Showoff
I love this. He was so cool about it too.
I love the guys reaction
This happened to me once.  On the plane ride home from deployment, I ended up between 2 guy soldiers I hadn't met before.  I put my headphones on, put on my neck pillow, and fell asleep.  Woke up and the guy to my right was also using my neck pillow.  Since he was also sleeping, I just closed my eyes and fell back asleep.  When I woke again, one of them had covered me with a blanket.  Seemed like a fair trade.  :)I saw them several times after that.  Nice guys.
That dude has life by the balls. Random women just cuddling with him. I bet he has a hot wife, f you money, cute kids, and a huge schlong.
r/germaphobes going crazy right now tho
Why were they filming
If genders were reversed, we’re looking at a potential harassment case.
Looks staged to me. Like the girl and the filmer were in on it, not the stranger she snuggled up to.
That girl is thirsty AF
Beautiful coat, is your pupper Aussie/German mix?
That is an absolutely gorgeous dog. Looks like a blue heeler mix
That pattern combo is lovely
Mass hysteria!
Aww, Coyote and the Ocelot!

You are forgiven, Doggo. You are still a good boy.
Looks like he executed order 66.
He's a dark side doggo.
With me, the force was*

That’s genuine love.
This so fucking PURE
That’s really sweet
You’re grandpa is a wise man. Learn from him.
My mother handed me a blank notebook with my name and birthday on the first page and told me it was my baby book.  I don’t know why she did that, all it showed me is she didn’t care enough to write anything else in it.
*Yes, yes, hellllooooo hooman! I make-a-deez! Dis is Button, and dis is Lizzie! Boop for you, boop for you, boop for me! Dey are mine, you may look but no touch*
In nature, what would happen to these pups? Does a wolf litter grow up and stay put with their mom, forming permanent pack?
exhausted parent
The one on the far right doesn’t have a bowl! Someone get that pup a bowl!!
Awwww, I found my dog years ago tied to a pole as well, best dog I ever had, lived 15 years.
God love her!!! I hate ppl!!!
Those ears are so cute!!!!!
Or orrrrrr did you just steal someone’s dog while they were in a shop...? Lol I kid I kid!
No offense to you of course for saving her.
Awwww what a cute doggo. Glad she'll spend the rest of her life with you. :) Some people are just awful. :/
That colour really brings out those eyes :)
Awesome!!

Huh.  Doesn’t look a thing like Ron Perlman.
Baaaww! Such cute li'l huggsies! Makes me wish I could adopt a little kitteh, but not enough $ or space or time for one. 😪
When I was little we had kittens and we pretended they were a band called the “Meower Brothers.” My first thought at seeing this pic: aww it’s the Meower Brothers

Ah yes, the 3 varieties of fluffy. 😍

The second bot post I've seen today.
Give that lil dude a strawberry!
That's so mean!
He probably thinks your nail is a piece of fruit. Give him some fruit.
Feed the poor thing
Stop trolling lil guy and give him some watermelon
Chomp
This infuriated me. I've never felt so much for a turtle. I demand fruit on his behalf.
Fuck me this tomato is hard to eat
Having been bit by a turtle before. This is a dangerous game. XD
Danger my ass. That dog is thinking about how he got the warm spot AND the kid. Win win.
Protecc Pillow
The most dangerous thing about this situation is if the kid is allergic to dog hair...
SAFE pillow
I’m guessing the danger is to anyone who threatens that kid.  The kid is just about as safe as he’ll ever be.
GSDs are the best i swear.
Normally you sleep with a weapon under the pillow not as a pillow.
At first I wasn't sure what's that angry fluff, but then I saw it's eyes. What a cute small potato!
Hahah. That kitty is in another dimension!
RIP chair.
I want one.

You really shouldn’t touch wild baby mammals because if the mother smells a different scent on them they might abandon them.

Dog: I'm stuck!Cat: No! I am stuck!
Caught a member of Al-Catiah.
Dogs typically crush the skulls of smaller animals when they attack them. I learned the hard way. After twenty years of owning several dogs and cats, I adopted a rescue dog that went after one of my cats. My cat didn’t survive, and I didn’t think I could ever live through that guilt. But I learned a lot from it. For the first time, I have to separate one of my pets from the others every time I leave the house. I’ll never take my pet harmony for granted again. Edit: sorry for the downer comment, but if someone can learn from my mistake, well worth it.

Omg, he is just the sweetest! I read online that bigger dog breeds have less energy as puppies than some others, would you agree? 😂
Hello cuteness 😊
If this isn’t a St. Bernard, could you share the breed? Cute pup!
Sooo precious!! ❤️❤️❤️
I can foresee a foster fail in your very near future.
So cute
"should i pee in her lap now or now?"
I couldn't do that, I would get the puppy and it would never go to a new home, it would be mine forever and there would be no getting it away from me
5 (?) Weeks old, Sadie is enjoying her first day inside, just in time for Carolinas first snow.
Oh no, now you did it. You are staring into those magic puppy eyes. They are putting the foster fail spell on you.Lol
Aww, my great grandparents had a doggo exactly like this one some years ago. I'm certain he's a reincarnation, give him all the pets!
"but... I was just showing how much I love you...   And that there was some cheese..."
10/10 would give belly rubs and treats to this sad looking good boye
He’s thinking - “dude how tf do I not lick my face”
You let him lick your face.
He can lick my face...and receive belly rubs and ear scritches.
Allow him!!
But how will you know how much I love you... and what I had for dinner?
You’re a mean Hooman
Let him lick your face, you monster!!
It brakes my heart. Let him lick the face 😍
That is definitely his dog, you can see the embarrassment on his face.
Can I get my cookie now?
1, this isnt really Aww material2, Needs more JPG
And another karma bot is born.
My mom had an old glass patio table on the back porch to sit down at whenever we let the dogs out. She also had plants on this table and soon learned that as soon as we headed back inside without the dogs sometimes, one of the dogs would jump up onto the table to look at the kids hanging out at the apartments across the street. I was really scared for the dog at first, but as soon as we cleared off the table and pulled it closer to the house than the fence, it was just a nice lookout spot for him.
Not aww material just some asshole cats
Those 4 pixels are dope.
A beached pup
What a beautiful dog
What breed is that doggo?
Nah just a collie as far as I know, both his parents were border collies
Is he a collie lab?
"I made dis."
You see dis? I made dis. *mwah*
I've seen this many times, but it's still a treat to see again.
Sweetest thing I have ever seen in a long while.  So adorable
One of my favorite pictures on the interwebz.
Looks like he’s doing that Lion King pose that Simba does with his baby!
His face is just pure joy
Such a happy chappy

I’d like to stroke that belly. I’m pretty sure she’d be fine with that.

If that was me, my mom would be standing there yelling at me for falling in.
Mother's love in nature is the same selflessness.
That's wonderful to watch.
Fierce!
He looked so happy about that. Obviously a lover of animals 💖
I definitely would have gone NUTS!
He seems like he has a great personality 😍😍😍
This is way more wholesome than I thought it was gonna be
I once had a pet squirrel, raised from a baby, that would do this.
Damn the OP didn’t even get 1 day of karma before this got reposted.
Amazing lol. I would be flipping out if that squirrel jumped on me!

How long did you train that squirrel, Zappos?
Wonder if the squirrel thought his hat was a nut. Disappointed squirrel

Any recommendations on how to prevent cats from taking down the tree when they do this? In past years I've just not put up a tree, but I'd like to start doing so.
Is this his first time being in a tree? He’s a natural.
The best bauble of awwble!
Hmm. Maybe fasten the tree to the wall? Eye screw > string > eye screw.
It’s the first time that I have ever seen her being in the tree! I’m sure she chills in there while I’m at work sometimes. I haven’t seen Grey Cat in the tree yet, but he is a bit slow.
give that pup a high five

That's an adorable hedgehog but putting a finger that close to his mouth makes me nervous. I worked at a pet store in high school and I was only once ever bitten by a hedgehog but it was easily the worst bite I suffered there.
my dog met a fish the other day at the vet
What a good boi
Give him whatever he wants
will u bite down on my balls until they pop

Okay. That's officially the cutist creature I've ever seen.
That doggo looks weird. Actually took me a while to figure out what it was.  Thought it was a hyena pup at first.
You don't !
You can’t it’s the rules...
Aww glad she has found a good home
She chose you. You’re very lucky, make sure you repay her with treats.
Awesome!
Congratulations and happy Caturday!
Beautiful cat!  I have adopted from the humane society with fantastic results and highly recommend it when looking for a new fur ball.
So pretty - she looks like my Zoey, who just passed away at 21 last week.  Thanks fo the photo - really made my day.
I've often thought that on some instinctive level animals understand when they are needed by the unwell.
So cute
My cat as a kid used to do that ... just looked out like “what?”
Congratulations!
It’s like a video game, where you run into the wall but just keep running regardless. Lol. Adorable.

I give him credit for not screaming like a girl and running for his truck.😆

That squirrel gave him a full stop and frisk.

Offering strong support or huge judgement on your progress?
New levels of cuteness
How is it that you came to hold this adorable  and delicate creature in your hand?!  What spell have you cast upon it?  What great deed have you done to deserve this blessing?  Or as in my case, has your cat just murdered the rest of its family?
awwwwwww
They're adorable!
Ok, this probably is a comment I should make, I usually am super positive about animals...Here's my story: wolves were 'reintroduced' in my region after 300-ish years, (north east Italy), there used to be wild fawns here, there aren't anymore.They prey on calfs and lambs aswell, my father found skulls and bones.Just felt like sharing 🙂
These wildlife cameras are much better than the trail cameras we’ve been seeing for so long.
U wot mate??

Never heard a dog make a sound like that, wow.
I make that same sound every morning when the alarm goes off.
I need confirmation that cuddles were indeed given.
I’ve had mornings like that!
She’s fantastic. Even those toes can’t decide what they want to be. Gorgeous, thanks for sharing.
I'm in love
I love his reaction.

I love those big snow shoe paws.

Just out of the cocoon face. https://imgur.com/gallery/RZ0ZGWaHe’s not normally allowed in our bed, but I couldn’t tell him off or turf him out!
Looks like he wants to be left alone.

Did he just poo on ur pillow
Aww, she's all tuckered out.
Very clean toe beans, 13/10 good gorl.

I would say spot, but that's pretty basic. Give her something fun and fresh like "Splotch". "Here Splotch! Who's a good Splotch?"

He’s petting his babies
She's going to raise some heccin good boyes
Is he making sure they don't eat too fast?! So freaking cute!!!
Looks like he's making sure they eat
He’s actually teaching them to slow down, it happens most often in households that leave food out for their pup to snack on during the day.I think it’s adorable and amazing how a dog will incorporate the way they were raised into the way they raise their young.
This is the most pure thing I’ve ever laid eyes on ♥️♥️
Some background: this is myself and my cat, Sammy. She's Hungarian, her passport is better than mine. She's half persian, half Norwegian forest cat, and she likes to fetch and fight paper balls
trick question it’s a gerbal
I guess they never fish, huh.
I don't get it.  It's clearly a cat.  Not doing anything remotely fish like, nor does it look remotely like a fish
Little guy is so happy! :D

It’s a heart warming picture (:
Toothless?
Aww, she just hadn’t found the right lap yet.
I love lap cats, especially the tabby lap cats. Immune if you pet him long enough he’ll roll on his side for belly rubs and eventually he falls asleep on you until you stop

Nephi (real name: Nefertiti) is a really nice cat.The two things she likes the most in her life are hugs and playing. She never refuses to play or to have cuddles. She especially loves this toy: she jumps after it and pulls it very hard, until I let go and she takes it as a trophy, for me to go get it so that I can play again with her. In the end, I don’t know if I am playing with her, or she plays with me 😊
Too funny. Does kitty intentionally drop the toy in?
Another reason to wash your hands before dinner.
maybe he's thirsty? like the cats that lick water off their paws
i wish i had a tongue that could do that

When they love, you have to love back. My cat avoids me unless she’s hungry, or wants to love on me. A few days ago I was sick and she crawled into bed with me to keep me company. I couldn’t ask for a better cat. 💕
Umm, he's looking at you...
I don't know why it never occurred to me that animals have and lose baby teeth too... I mean it makes sense after all
No she didn’t... it’s right there, in your hand
Wait... dogs have puppy teeth?!
I remember when I found one of these stuck in my baseboard. Smoking gun.
Once, my dog walked up to me, looked up, and licked her nose.  A tooth fell out!  I was amazed!  She looked down and ate it off the floor before I could pick it up.  I gave up then and there on finding another one.
Nice blanket!
Soft kitty, Speedy kitty, Imma chew my pawSoft kitty, Speedy kitty, Imma do it more
That dog looks completely unamused. "Ok John, tell me again how this is better than treats and a nap on the couch?"
You know Kevin, when we get home I’m totally going to lay some brown pipe behind the couch for this. You bastard Kevin.
Why would someone with the guts to hang glide need a service dog?
Looks hesitant...
One of these Doggos clearly smoked something before this pic
So cuuuuute!
Daaaaaaaaw, they look so happy!

Beautiful Turkish Angora.
At his new door (ftfy).
Congratulations on your new kitty!
Mewling <3
My two cats crash the party everytime I go in and try to close the door. Looks like you are in the same situation.
Thank you for giving him a loving home!
There's no place like home...Thanks for adopting.
Give her a hug already, you devilspawn!
You’ve got the chilled one and the excited one
'No, just lay still for a few moments. Honest, it's great.''But.... But.... OH LOOK! THINGS! I need to look at the things.''Chill out and relax.'
She looks like it :)
Aww she looks very content 😁
Nice key outline there
That squirrels work out routine includes crunches. You don’t get a 6pack like that eating birdseed all day
The lady in the back doesn't want to work either lol everyone just wants to watch that dog
He tied
Spirit FLL?Edit: I seriously think the arm with the camo jacket that comes into the frame might be me if this was at FLL. Mildly freaking out rn.

He does not want anything else in my Johnson, Howard!
Franny is definitely best girl.
And we enjoy Salem enjoying that tree
My cat in my childhood was named Salem and had the exact same colours. <3 swoon.
It took me, legit, 3 minutes to figure out this was a dogs face with eyes closed.
Santa always is the best judge of good girls and boys😊
Don't forget to pack the cat!
Lovely coloring too.
*Those cats were fast as lightning*
are you guys outside?  What are you guys doing? <3  <3  <3
I'll dm you my address. I'll even send postage costs. Its be worth every penny.

What does I have to do for winning this *trophy* ?
Aww.  They look very sweet.
I want someone to look at me the way your dog is looking at you.
Just can't wait to be king.
"Enough with the pictures and get me my goddamn coffee, Karen"
Disgruntled
When Karen finally lets you see the kids but when you go they are actually at the new boyfriends house and you’re stuck with the bitch
I don’t even know how to describe that dog. It’s like it’s face is lab but the rest of it is like...some curly haired animal. They’re cute though so it’s okay.
If an "I want to talk to your manager." Haircut type had a dog.
Someone is not pleased with your behavior: "*This* shit again!"

wow great looks like a big family&#x200B;
Designer dogs.  Nope.
WE DONT DESERVE THESE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES😭😭😭😋😋😋 I love doggos
She’s adorable
So handsome! Give him lots of pets and kisses!
Such a good boy!!!
I have one that is over 11. The slope they start to go down as they age is heartbreaking, but the breed is amazingly resilient and seemingly very positive. I make sure to pay even more attention to him now than I once did, he seems to find comfort in it. Good luck making it to 13. He's a good looking old boy.
Who's so tired of him?))
That’s one cute cat.
King 👑
A smiling goat! 😍
You are blessed
Hot puppies on a cold floor?
Next stop: the bedI know, been there, done that The only annoying thing is, if mine take the bed before me, there’s no way to move them, at only 20kg/40lbish, they can weight several tones while on the bed
Awwwh
WHY DID U EAT A BABY!!!
What type of dog is this beautiful boy?
cute. is that Bunnings? Dogs aren't allowed at Bunnings here :(
Harry? What kind of a name is that for a dog? It’ll get reported or something. Ha ha ha ha. I like that it wants to correct you to, “Haha.”

Looks like she's going to sleep through Christmas:)
You ain't kidding. She is REALLY enjoying it. Happy Holidays sweet pup.

Tabbies are the best!
Yes they sure are. I have a 3 yr old female named Lily Rose. She is just so independent. Whereas my calico lulu is my shadow. Everywhere I go she goes. She is a mommas girl lol.

Do not let your cat stay on top of your computer! I’ve learned the hard way that cat puke can destroy hardware lol it went through the grill/ fans and piled up on my video card. Save your computer, move the kitty

What a good boye. Mine would zoomie right out of the county and never be seen again
As someone from Australia... Nope! You can keep your bears
Green snake is flipping black bear left and right and all around! Black bear might not be able to keep up! Green snake's got black bear all tangled, black bear is struggling Black Bear is unconscious and green snake is still flipping him around! Call it! Call the fight!
This is just an infomercial for the magic hose.
Seems like a great place to raise children.
I was really worried before I clicked on the actual video
RIP green hose
Its gamera!
I see what you did there.And that's a mighty handsome pupper.
I love that pup! And that carpet, can I ask where you got it?
So beautiful ! What breed is the one on the right ??
I have a blanket like that. My grandmother made me it. But it’s got a black border
It's spelled Mifflin
That’s adorable. But by the way, it’s spelled Mifflin with two i’s
Mobile I guess that’s how I thought I spelled
Clever!

Hello Scarlet!  You're a beautiful little girl.

Doin a listen
Dog in a bandana, like it always should be
W E T D A W G
It is quite possible he is being bullied and is being forced to be the net. If so “lovely” becomes “disgraceful”
He's gonna get hit in the face so much
Is his name Duncan?
Off the backboard ......
Gotta trust your dog on this one!
Bottom right seems to enjoying it
What biscuits?
Do you... mean blankets..?
I thought “Biscuits” was your (fictional) poodle and I came here to say “Nawwwww B, that’s a fleece sweater”.But then I read the other comments 🧠

I miss when mine was this little!
I miss my little guy sitting in the same seat! Did the same thing while doing house work. He loved watching me do anything I was doing. Now he wants to “help” which isn’t too helpful...
Aww, Enjoy it while it last. Haha.
My cat won’t lay on our printer, but she does come running to stare at it every time it turns on. It’s wireless, so sometimes I print things from phone while on the coach just to watch her come running into the living room.
Adorable!!! What kind of dog is this?
That's a perfectly goofy name for a Kitty and I love everything about it.
Maaaaa!!! Where’s the meatloaf??!?!
Wow, such teeth.
Well, give her what she wants! She deserves it!
Look at those eyes, how can you say no.
How big do they get?

It’s his now. Does not look like he has any intention of returning it.

Does that mean babies soon or something else
Those are some quality beans
Kitty may be unimpressed but is a gorgeous kitty
You're my Elf now!
Lol it looks like she was feeling super hyper about a toy or something.
Her light patch in the front looks like a bra. Did she give you permission to post her in her undies?!
She s an awesome dog!   Hi Jersey...greetings from Canada!
If gifs have taught me anything, it's that duck mothers can be fierce protectors. Watch your back
I hope you've looked into what it takes to care for a duck. They're super cute but super needy. Make sure you stock up on diapers. Also, "Tom."
Okay, I get the three pictures on the top and left, but why you gotta include the selfie? No one is here for your makeup mug.
